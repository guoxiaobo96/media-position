take a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections — a plausible scenario for many european cities, zeynep writes, based on an analysis conducted by adam kucharski, a professor at the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine. as things stand, with those numbers, we'd expect 129 deaths in a month. if the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. in contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month — assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.

we have a long way to go to ensure that the rest of america's minorities — including jews of color and visibly orthodox jews — have the same choice. still, there's something magical in the spectacle of two jews fighting over money before a nation that sees only two americans. it reflects the fulfillment of liberal democracy's promise: that it can ultimately grant a minority group full access to the rights and privileges of the majority, not by forcing them to abandon their identity but allowing them to choose how much to let it define them. when america lives up to its ideals, anyone can show up in the public sphere with just as much of their personal, religious, even national identity as they like, and no one — not the government, nor public opinion — can force a lick more of it onto them.

-- the national park service has decided to use entrance fees to pay for expanded operations at popular sites, an unprecedented step that some call illegal. juliet eilperin reports: under a memorandum signed saturday by the interior department's acting secretary, david bernhardt ... park managers will be permitted to bring on additional staff to clean restrooms, haul trash, patrol the parks and open areas that have been shut during the more-than-two-week budget impasse. in a statement sunday, national park service deputy director p. daniel smith acknowledged that the administration's practice of keeping parks open but understaffed has become unsustainable at some of its most beloved sites. … congressional democrats and some park advocates question whether the park-fee move is legal, because the fees that parks collect under the federal lands recreation enhancement act are expressly designated to support visitor services instead of operations and basic maintenance.
so hosts, here are a few tips for welcoming friends into your home, even during a future snowmageddon.
first, here's the analysis, in robb's own words:
there's two kingdoms. there's the earthly kingdom and the heavenly kingdom. in the heavenly kingdom the responsibility is to treat others as you'd like to be treated. in the earthly kingdom, the responsibility is to choose leaders who will do what's best for your country. think about it. why have americans been able to do more to help people in need around the world than any other country in history? it's because of free enterprise, freedom, ingenuity, entrepreneurism and wealth. a poor person never gave anyone a job. a poor person never gave anybody charity, not of any real volume. it's just common sense to me.
the flow of test-takers was so large and consistent that it created its own miniature economy. one entrepreneur operated a makeshift storage locker out of a nearby parked truck. since the applicants could not take anything inside the exam center, he kept backpacks and phones for a fee of 50 rupees (70 cents). a vendor sold tube socks and ear buds on the sidewalk.
donald trump won the election on nov. 8, 2016. by that time, u.s. intelligence officials had publicly blamed russia for the release of the hacked emails, describing it as an effort to interfere with the us election process.
that shift seems to be taking place in afghanistan. with many afghans — 87 percent, according to one survey — believing that women should have the same educational opportunities as men, the taliban has faced pressure from communities to change its policies toward education, which barred girls and women from schools in the past. the taliban's change in strategy is in line with my research, which explains why armed groups tend to be pragmatic in their governance strategies, and how civilians often shape rebel governance. in indonesia, for instance, religious leaders pushed gam — an ethno-nationalist group that fought a war to form its own state — to adopt an increasingly religious agenda. this change helped the rebel group gain wider support from its religious constituency.

the departure of so many dea employees for the drug industry gave the distributors an unfair advantage, said jonathan p. novak, formerly a dea lawyer. there was a fear, he said. it comes from seeing that some of the best and brightest former dea attorneys are now on the other side and know all of the weak points.

this wasn't a radical new idea: annapolis closes busy west street for a weekly street festival each summer, and old town alexandria voted in 2019 to close a stretch of king street on weekends between april and october. but the dire situation facing restaurants and bars forced local jurisdictions to reconsider their priorities: diners enjoying a meal, a beer garden and entertainment outdoors were judged more important than drivers going a few blocks out of their way. with restaurants staring into a financial abyss, these models should continue for the foreseeable future. make outdoor dining the destination, whether that's tables with waterfront views in annapolis's historic downtown, or bethesda's food court-style tables, which let visitors choose from any nearby restaurant — perfect for the group who can't decide on one cuisine.

the system is complex and often requires explanation. on capitol hill, it is usually my democratic colleagues who need reminders of the electoral college's vital role in preserving our system of federalism. this week, however, it is republican members of congress who require a refresher course about why the electoral college must be preserved — and why we should avoid the temptation of using this system in a misguided effort to jettison a presidential election.
republicans have been predicting a democratic crack-up on impeachment for nearly the entirety of the trump presidency, and it simply hasn't happened. in 2018, as the president of the house gop's super pac, strategist corry bliss repeatedly speculated that the angry democratic base would nominate impeachment-obsessed candidates, who would alienate swing voters.

in the republican worldview, all americans are real americans, because we all pledge allegiance to one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. as lincoln said in his first inaugural address, we are not enemies, but friends, because we are all members of one, all-embracing body politic. we're all in this together. this civic conception of patriotism stands in stark contrast to the blood-and-soil conception increasingly evident on the conservative right. . . . such attitudes and rhetoric are utterly poisonous.

patients who struggle to afford insulin sometimes ration their supply to make it last longer — a dangerous practice that can create disabling or deadly complications. it's very shortsighted to skimp on insulin, says kasia lipska, an endocrinologist and diabetes researcher at yale school of medicine. in the long term, it's going to cost us much more. poor glycemic control can lead to blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart disease and stroke. in the short term, patients who stop taking enough insulin can lapse into diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition where blood sugars get too high and the body's blood becomes acidic. it can become fatal in just hours or a few days.

the trump administration signaled its hostility to this approach in a report issued last month by the federal commission on school safety, which recommended rescinding the school discipline guidance. in a sharply worded and controversial chapter, the report said the validity of disparate impact analysis cannot be squared with the supreme court's holdings. the administration revoked the guidance a few days later.
the meaning of this is plain. trump has claimed he objects to the lottery program because it admits terrorists, but he still objects to the deal reached on it because it still allows people (those with tps) from the wrong countries, the shithole countries, to remain. he wants more funding for the wall, which is symbolic, yes, but that's exactly the point: as frank sharry of america's voice puts it to me, the wall is a middle finger to latin america, a statement that we don't want your kind. it's a middle finger to shithole countries, but more to the point, it's a statement that we don't want the people from them.

in the midst of the black freedom movement of the 1960s, numerous politicians and academics and the mainstream media contrasted chinese with african americans. they found it expedient to invoke chinese culture to counter the demands of civil rights and black power activists for substantive change. in 1966, then-assistant secretary of labor daniel patrick moynihan defended his controversial claim that the too-strong emphasis on matriarchy in black culture was to blame for the deterioration of african american communities by pointing to the enlightened family life of the relatively well-to-do chinese. the magazine u.s. news & world report unequivocally made the same charged comparison: at a time when it is being proposed that hundreds of billions be spent to uplift negros and other minorities, the nation's 300,000 chinese americans are moving ahead on their own — with no help from anyone else.
so what's the lesson? when a movement begins, the final goal may not yet be clear. it can be hard to see the political possibility in what has for so long has been impossible. even if saturday's marches don't immediately deliver a clear policy objective, they might be the start of a movement that will. we may well be surprised, as some early women's rights organizers were, by which grievances become the central rallying cry.

this supply-side approach has been in place at the federal level since the dawn of the drug war: the federal drug budget has traditionally emphasized approaches like destroying plants, intercepting drug shipments and arresting the people who sell drugs. the logic is straightforward: you reduce the supply of drugs, those drugs become more expensive, and the higher prices drive down demand and use of the drugs. economics 101, right?

virginia's new statewide registration system will send out weekly reminders to residents that they are still in the queue. fairfax county, which is opting out of the state's registration system, launched its own data dashboard, which allows people who signed up with that county to get more information about when they might get appointments.
vaccinations are off to a sluggish start across the d.c. region. in maryland, less than one-quarter of the state's initial batch of 273,875 vaccines has been used. in virginia, it's only one-fifth of the state's allotment of 451,075 doses. in d.c., the number stands at about 17,000 of 40,075 delivered doses. in one d.c. case, two men who are not in priority to receive the vaccine were given their shots after first responders missed their appointments for a vaccination at a giant foods supermarket. a pharmacist approached the two men and asked if they wanted to get the moderna shots since the product would go bad if it wasn't used immediately. (greg schneider, michael brice-saddler and erin cox)
mcauliffe will have to overcome his association with the clintons and big-money politics. he'll need to avoid sounding like debbie downer raining on the progressives' dreams. however, his effort to tie his own candidacy, should he decide to win, with the party's successes running moderate candidates holds promise. (as we approach 2020, he writes, we should look at the candidates who won in swing districts in 2018. they are an energetic, diverse group who ran on realistic goals of lowering the cost of health care, improving education and raising wages.) he could make his message a unifying one as a candidate for all americans (urban poor, suburban middle class, college and non-college-educated): trump is hyper-divisive and a failure at governance; mcauliffe is the uniter who knows how to govern.
inmate status will not make a difference in terms of timing of receipt of the vaccine, cahill said. someone who falls into a category for early priority of the vaccine and is in custody will receive the vaccine at the same time as someone in the same category who is outside our correctional facilities.
democratic voters could agree on the main goal through a messy primary race and a quarantined general election: they would put aside differences to defeat president trump.

mid-june: mitt romney's annual donor summit is expected to celebrate its fifth year in park city, utah, — the first, obviously, with the host representing the state as a senator. there will be several moments when republicans ask (or the press prods them to ask) if the party can go into 2020 with trump still leading it; this will be the most scenic of those moments.

still, bridenstine's path to confirmation remains tricky due to concerns voiced by some republicans, including sen. marco rubio of florida, who said he does not want to see the politicization of nasa. during the 2016 presidential race, bridenstine appeared in ads on behalf of sen. ted cruz of texas and suggested rubio, then a white house candidate, was soft on terror.
project birmingham had its roots in the anger and frustration democrats felt after losing the white house and congress in 2016 — with the assistance, many were convinced, of online disinformation peddled by russians and also u.s. conservatives active on social media, who pushed damaging but false information about democrat hillary clinton's health, honesty and suitability for office.
on wednesday, march 10, the city's revamped portal for vaccine appointments launched. it asks eligible residents to register once and then await an email with a link they can use to make an appointment. once registrants are chosen to get a vaccine, they will be notified through a call, a text or an email and will need to book their appointment within 48 hours — or wait until they are selected again. going forward, invitations will be sent out at 10 a.m. thursdays and sundays. eligible individuals may also register over the phone. forty percent of the initial portal appointments will be reserved for residents 65 and older, while another 40 percent will go to residents ages 18 to 64 with a qualifying medical condition. twenty percent of appointments will go to essential workers. half of all these appointments are reserved for people who live in priority zip codes.

but what also matters is recognizing how each individual can improve the well being of students and teachers within local schools. giving on donors choose is a place to start. another is paying attention when education funding is cut by local, state, and national governments. no professional adult should be digging in a trash can to do his or her job well. and no child should go without proper resources for learning and thriving either.

the final days of the runoff campaign were all about trump. on saturday, he badgered brad raffensperger, georgia's republican secretary of state, in a phone call, pressing him to find enough votes to declare trump the winner of the november election. his monday night rally in dalton was a textbook case of a president wallowing in conspiracy theories, baseless charges and long-refuted arguments.
i gave an awkward laugh, we thanked him, and got out of the car. but as i prepared for events that evening, i couldn't shake his words. the truth is that i am one of the lucky ones. the hours of planning and grading, the almost anxiety-producing passion for my work, and the years of standing in front of young people to help them grow into productive adults led me to stand on the fifty yard line at the college football playoffs national championship game and wave to a cheering crowd as a representative of the work that many teachers do.

at a hearing in early fall, sen. thomas r. carper (d-del.) pressed the epa's director of groundwater and drinking water on when the agency might announce its plans to regulate the chemicals and finalize a drinking-water standard. peter grevatt, an agency veteran who recently retired, responded that officials were continuing to visit communities and develop a long-term management plan. he acknowledged that it could take the agency a number of years to put enforceable regulations in place — if it determined that the contaminants were surfacing in enough water systems to be considered a nationwide health concern.
i'm here to stand for the integrity of my faith and of the gospel. i'm not willing to sacrifice that for political expediency, said the rev. jacek orzechowski, a community organizer with catholic charities of washington. for someone to say they're pro-life but display callous policies that tear families apart is reprehensible.

park guthrie knows about this paralysis in climate-change-spooked kids. a sixth-grade teacher in sonoma county, calif., he has seen the toll that the state's raging wildfires can take on the generally enthusiastic 11- and 12-year-olds in his classes. he has witnessed panic attacks triggered by the mere smell of smoke. when smoke from a nearby controlled burn once drifted to the school, he recalls, one boy smiled blankly and announced, i think i'm having ptsd. last year, after the kincade fire burned nearly 78,000 acres in the county in late october, guthrie found himself, not for the first time, comforting students worried about their homes and their relatives.

since that republican official shrugged at the harm of humoring trump, trump and the far right have only spiraled farther from the center of the galaxy, like a voyager probe of nonsense. when fox news had the gall to accurately report that trump lost his reelection bid, trump and his allies rejected the network. fox news spent years building foot soldiers for the maga movement, but, in refusing to accede to his theories, it was quickly rejected by many republicans.
he said thoroughly wiping down surfaces while traveling is always in order, because many viruses and bacteria can survive on objects. the cdc said it may be possible for someone to get the coronavirus by touching something that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but it's still not known how long the virus can survive on surfaces.
overall, households in the top 30 percent of the earnings distribution would receive almost half of all the dollars forgiven. to put it even more starkly: erasing all federal student debts would benefit the top 10 percent of earners just as much as the bottom 30 percent combined. those calculations are for wiping away all debt, but forgiveness is even more regressive if it is limited to $10,000 or $50,000.

-- joe biden is nearing a final decision on a 2020 presidential run. the new york times's jonathan martin and alexander burns report: [biden] has told allies he is skeptical the other democrats eyeing the white house can defeat [trump], an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. … yet mr. biden's skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and african-americans are expected to run. … more broadly, debate around mr. biden's possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. … but mr. biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks.

consider women's suffrage politics in colorado, as i detailed in my book, the woman suffrage movement in america: a reassessment. in 1875, national suffrage leadership sent two organizers to the state, thinking it was ready for the vote. the national organizers couldn't interest anyone. one shocked organizer reported that we were told in central — one of the places where we could not get a hearing — that we must advertise a dogfight, then we could get a crowd.
trump initially wanted all u.s. troops out of syria within 30 days, triggering mattis's resignation and concerns from republicans and democrats that the decision would create more chaos in the region. the president, in a video posted on his twitter account dec. 19, said u.s. troops were all coming back from syria and that they're coming back now.
by comparison, neil chatterjee, a republican and former aide to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), wrote in his separate comments that i applaud secretary perry's bold leadership in jump-starting a national conversation on this urgent challenge, and expressed concern about the many nuclear and coal units particularly at risk of economic retirement despite their significant contribution to bulk power system resilience.
while i fully acknowledge the strong earnings and data from the united states, indeed pre wuhan crisis, i fully expected the u.s. to continue to outperform the rest of the developed world, jeffrey halley, an analyst with oanda, wrote in commentary tuesday. those earnings and data points though are backwards facing, and the potential impact of the wuhan virus is nowhere near yet being able to be fully quantified in its implications for global growth.
that approach still angered many advocates, who argue it could brew mistrust and scare immigrants away from an immunization campaign meant to reach as many people in nebraska as possible. despite the remarks from ricketts, hundreds of undocumented workers do in fact work in the crowded, high-risk facilities deemed essential to the nation's food supply, they say.
women were just barely the majority — 50.04 percent — of the american workforce last january. in april, 16.2 percent of women were unemployed, which meant women lost about 11 million jobs that month, according to the bureau of labor statistics. men lost 9 million jobs during the same time, and the total 20 million jobs lost is an american record since world war ii, according to the bls.

he routinely attended galas and black-tie federalist society events that included justices thomas, alito and antonin scalia, as well as mcconnell and other leading lawmakers, according to interviews and annual reports by the federalist society.
we should be worried, as cohen points out, that trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for america. perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among american leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of u.s. foreign policy. . . . trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the united states is merely one great power among others. in this view, washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of u.s. leaders so carefully built.
march 10, 2019, issue: the pasts of a number of politicians have recently been major news. and as the 2020 campaign unfolds, there will surely be more revelations. voters can accept some dissonance between who politicians claim to be and who they are, says illustrator matt huynh. however, voters can't be infinitely forgiving: i think we aren't so naive to expect moral piety from representatives pragmatically dealing with messy expectations. but demanding an official resign or be otherwise punished for immoral, and certainly criminal, behavior is important to signal a standard of values and conduct for the wider community.

when the dea suspected that a company was ignoring suspicious sales, the agency filed an order to show cause. that gave a company at least 30 days to explain why the agency should not revoke its registration.
the standard rejoinder is that publicly listed corporations are obligated to their shareholders to use qualifications and expertise, not other criteria, when selecting directors. that assumes that fresh perspectives and insights into non-white, non-male and nontraditional gender identity communities (not to mention markets) are irrelevant to corporate performance, or that qualified women and minorities don't exist. the same so-called pipeline problem was used to exclude women and minorities from entry-level, journeyman and executive jobs alike in most u.s. workplaces — including newsrooms — for decades. the stated policy of hiring only the best qualified, as defined by white male managers, inevitably produced job forces dominated by white males.

the post has twice investigated the industry's battles with the dea, first in 2016 and again in 2017 with 60 minutes. but the full story has never been told because so few of the people involved will talk about it. the list of people who have declined to be interviewed includes former congressman tom marino (r-pa.), who first proposed the bill; former acting dea administrator chuck rosenberg, whose agency surrendered to the pressure; former attorney general loretta e. lynch, whose department did not stand in the way of the legislation; and, finally, then-president barack obama, who signed it into law.

women serving as ranking republicans of key committees include kay granger (tex.) on appropriations, virginia foxx (n.c.) on education and labor, and cathy mcmorris rodgers (wash.) on energy and commerce. the energy and commerce committee will be significant, since the incoming biden administration promises to focus on the economy, health care and climate change. and in a divided congress, many issues will be dealt with in must-pass spending bills spearheaded by the appropriations committee. that will elevate the importance of granger's ability to work with incoming chair rosa l. delauro (d-conn.). delauro is expected to emphasize issues such as paid family leave and increased child-care spending, seeing them as important to the economic recovery.

the coronavirus has besieged state prisons around the country. unsanitary and crowded conditions, which render social distancing aspirational only, threaten the health of men and women who often suffer from underlying health conditions. a rapidly aging prison population made prisons ripe for the virus. it is no surprise that virginia's prison facility for the elderly and sick witnessed the highest number of deaths.
what else do we know? history and official rhetoric suggest that the kremlin takes reciprocity and parity very seriously, and spy swaps are infrequent. in fact, the only spy swap between russia and a western government since the fall of the u.s.s.r. took place in 2010, when moscow was forced to scrounge up four convicted spies to exchange for 10 sleeper agents, including anna chapman, who had been caught in the united states.
this official described trump as so mad at pence he couldn't see straight. several white house aides were upset that the president chose to attack pence when the vice president, secured at an undisclosed location at the capitol, had just been in harm's way.
there are also about 5,200 u.s. troops in neighboring iraq, where they assist the government in the fight against the islamic state. when trump visited those troops dec. 26, he suggested that we could use this as the base if we wanted to do something in syria.

in the interview with the post, leo said he took time off from the federalist society — a charity that says it does not endorse specific nominees — during the nomination fights in 2005 and 2006. the group's tax filings show that his compensation in those two years jumped by nearly 50 percent, to about $328,000 annually. leo did not respond to a question about how his compensation was affected by his time off. a spokesman for the federalist society said leo's pay went up — despite the time off — because of the organization's extraordinary revenue growth. back at the federalist society the following year, his compensation was $419,000.

-- white house officials have been looking into the possibility of declaring a national emergency at the border for weeks now, according to bloomberg news's justin sink and jennifer jacobs. some advisers close to trump are recommending that he declare a national emergency, despite wide recognition that it would be immediately challenged in court. … but trump's consideration of such an extraordinary step indicates that some in the white house see the gambit as the president's lone way to salvage his wall pledge as the consequences of the shutdown begin to amplify and talks with democrats fall flat.

but many public health experts think that in light of evidence that the disease has taken root and spread in iran, italy, singapore and south korea, it's time to broaden testing in the united states. infectious disease experts fear that aside from the 14 cases picked up by public health surveillance, there may be other undetected cases mixed in with those of colds and flu. what scares experts the most is that the virus is beginning to spread in countries outside china, but no one knows whether that's the case in the united states, because they aren't checking.

trump also opposes the current deal because it would restrict family-based immigration (in which current immigrant citizens or permanent residents sponsor relatives for entry) only for the parents of the dreamers and some others, whereas trump wants much greater reductions in family-based immigration. but as dara lind points out, while this debate is complicated, this functionally means large reductions in the numbers of people from countries who already have large immigrant populations here — which means resisting trends shaping our current ethnic and national mix.

european governments are already grappling with a future shaped by rising costs for elder care, the consequences of declining populations and a shrinking workforce. the political solutions to these long-term challenges may include encouraging more immigration to fill jobs and weakening social protections to drive worker productivity. demographic anxieties will almost certainly take up greater space in western politics: on both sides of the atlantic, far-right movements increasingly see anti-feminism as a rallying cry at a time of declining birthrates.
pifko then showed kelly two talking points the organization had prepared for members of congress to pose during the hearing. one of them was a defense of the drug industry: it seems to me at the end of the day that prescription drug abuse is caused by inappropriate prescribing and inappropriate dispensing, neither of which wholesalers are authorized or capable of regulating or enforcing.

adults of all ages have the capacity for and interest in romance, intimacy and sexuality. it might appear that older adults, especially the oldest old, are less interested in sex and less sexually active than younger adults, but sexual behavior and desire involve more than how often people have sex. multiple social and health barriers can limit opportunities to pursue sexual relationships. for example, limited access to healthy partners because of living arrangements and unbalanced sex ratio diminishes opportunities as we age.

there's a tremendous gap of achievement between rich and poor, white and minority. this, too, leaves a divided society. and whatever the causes, the effect is discrimination. my friend phyllis hunter (ph), of houston, texas, calls reading the new civil right. equality in our country will remain a distant dream until every child, of every background, learns so that he or she may strive and rise in this world. no child in america should be segregated by low expectations, imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness of self-doubt. (applause) there's reason for optimism in this land. a great movement of education reform has begun in this country built on clear principles: to raise the bar of standards, expect every child can learn; to give schools the flexibility to meet those standards; to measure progress and insist upon results; to blow the whistle on failure; to provide parents with options to increase their option, like charters and choice; and also remember the role of education is to leave no child behind. i believe in these principles, and i've seen them work; i've seen them turn around troubled schools in my state, schools labeled by the world at-risk. at-risk means you're not supposed to learn, but we've challenged that in the state of texas. i've seen these schools and principles bring new hope, inspiring new confidences and ambitions. and i'm especially proud, in my state, that we're improve--our minority students are improving faster than almost any other state in the union.

the purpose of prosperity is to ensure the american dream touches every willing heart. and we cannot afford to have an america segregated by class, by race, or by aspiration. america must close the gap of hope between communities of prosperity and communities of poverty. we have seen what happens--we've seen what happens when african-american citizens have the opportunity they've earned and the respect that they deserve. men and women once victimized by jim crow have risen to leadership in the halls of congress.

news organizations have detailed policies regulating their journalists' behavior on social media. the basic rule: don't post anything on twitter or facebook you wouldn't say in your professional output, on a news broadcast or in a story. and yet, buying followers typically hasn't been addressed. among others, npr, the washington post and the associated press say they don't have an explicit rule against it, although padding one's follower count would likely violate general rules about maintaining credibility and transparency, according to both organizations. the new york times, which investigated the practice for months, didn't spell out its own policy in its article.

the democrats' margin in the house is the smallest the party has had in more than a century, and it will require every bit of speaker nancy pelosi's political savvy — and muscle — to keep her caucus united behind biden's agenda. a senate that relies on a vice president to break ties offers no margin for error and probably calls for considerable compromise.
another former senior administration official speculated that the day's events made pence more popular than trump. one man acted like a toddler, and the other acted like the second-highest-ranking constitutional official in the nation, the official said.
in the following days, mitchell took particular aim at biden's win in georgia, tweeting that the state's recount was a total sham and a fake!!! she wrote that the effort was cover for the sos, referring to secretary of state brad raffensperger. responding to criticism of her appearance, she tweeted, happy to be considered a nut job because i believe in the rule of law.

this was the operating assumption for much of trump's presidency: go along with his nonsense, get what you need where you can and, eventually, things will go back to normal. some in the establishment saw trump's loss as a chance to step away from fringe politics, operating under an assumption that those politics are mostly associated with trump himself.

new statistics on refunds paid through the t's on-time performance guarantee program show the cash-strapped authority was being bilked regularly, with some checks going to people claiming to be on two trains at once. the backroom business of people trying to cheat the system was even more rampant than we thought, massachusetts bay transportation agency general manager daniel grabauskas said. it's taken a lot of extra work on our part to get control of it. … during the investigation, transit police forced several charlatans to pay thousands of dollars in restitution and prosecuted one woman who initially refused to return the money. the t has since changed refund forms to require more information from riders and has inserted new language warning fraud will be prosecuted.

school safety in florida needs to be improved. we can do more and we can do a better job of ensuring the safety of students and staff on k-12 school campuses. not all school security changes or enhancements have financial costs, and some only require the will of decision-makers to effect change and hold people responsible for implementing best practices. safety and security accountability is lacking in schools, and that accountability is paramount for effective change if we expect a different result in the future than what occurred at marjory stoneman douglas high school (msdhs) on february 14, 2018.

many pundits and politicians have described trump's actions as unprecedented. actually, what is unprecedented about the situation is the opposition party's decision to impeach the president over such actions — something even hyperpartisan federalists avoided suggesting against madison (except for some minor grumblings a couple years later over a separate matter).

those faulty prewar claims have had a lasting impact on american credibility in the middle east and beyond. trump's penchant for making false or exaggerated claims — something he has done more than 15,000 times while in office, according to a tally by the washington post — has likely compounded that credibility gap.
he described the 4.7 percent unemployment rate before he took office as reasonably high, even though it was well below the average rate in the united states over the past 70 years. he also took credit for additional funding that has been approved for historically black colleges and universities, saying inaccurately that the funding saved the schools from ruin.

but history has shown any attempt to promote fair housing that does not actively work to destroy deeply ingrained systems of residential segregation will fail. research has shown time and again that segregated housing is detrimental to all in our society. the residential segregation we see today is the result of decades of housing policy that benefited white home buyers to the exclusion of others. in such a highly segregated system and society, the rhetoric of freedom of choice does nothing to afford individuals actual choices.

and you'd have to believe that the famously dispassionate belichick became suddenly more emotionally attached to garoppolo, who had won just two games for the patriots, than to an mvp who has won five super bowls, including two of the last three. and that belichick therefore, for the first time in his highly calculating career, made a terrible deal and maybe even intentionally kneecapped the organization he has so painstakingly hand-built. as opposed to doing the careful math on the patriots' salary cap and the money they would have to offer garoppolo to keep playing behind brady, and the leverage they were likely to lose if he didn't move on a deal for garoppolo in what he saw as the last window to get some value for him.

many of those contributions are indicative of political support for u.s. goals, a diplomatic achievement that previous administrations have touted as important. the initial invasion of iraq was largely a u.s.-british effort, but the bush administration worked hard to persuade countries as small as albania (1,340 troops over five years), estonia (240 troops over six years) and mongolia (1,128 troops over five years) to contribute to the post-invasion force.

the union at alphabet is forming without federal ratification, limiting its rights. and google has signaled its willingness in the past to fight back against such efforts. in december, the nlrb filed a complaint against google, accusing it of surveilling and terminating employees, and in 2019, the company hired consultants known for their anti-union efforts.

since 52 u.s. code 20511 was adopted as part of the national voter registration act of 1993, it has been used sparingly by federal prosecutors. it was used in 2005 to go after milwaukee woman kimberly prude, who voted illegally in the city while still on probation. but levitt said there is no precedent to use it against someone of trump's stature.

in washington, the soaring price of insulin has provoked bipartisan concern. members of congress are trying to parse the factors that have caused the spike. in november, a congressional caucus released a report on insulin, urging legislation aimed at lowering prices through increased competition and pricing transparency, among other recommendations. in june, the american medical association called on the government to monitor insulin pricing and market competition and take enforcement actions as appropriate. insulin, in some ways, serves as a proxy for the rising prices across the u.s. prescription drug market. on the campaign trail in 2016, donald trump railed against high drug prices, and his administration has vowed to lower them, releasing a flurry of proposals in the past year.
perhaps it's no surprise, then, that the trump administration is already gutting programming for women and girls around the globe. it has reinstituted the global gag rule, which requires that any international ngo that receives u.s. family planning funding may not offer or discuss abortion as an option. it defunds the unfpa, which provides reproductive and related health services to women and girls around the world. it has been threatening to cut such programs as let girls learn and the ambassador-at-large for global women's issues. further, obama's national action plan on women, peace and security had begun to open all u.s. military positions to women; bring more women into peace-building efforts around the globe; and offer services to those who had suffered or were at risk of suffering gender-based violence around the world. without executive commitment, those efforts could erode quickly.
as someone who loathes the administration, the short-term report card — [it] has to be said — is not bad. . . . those of us who said, 'he's just playing you,' we were wrong about that — in the short term, said charles camosy, an ethics and theology professor at fordham university who writes books and articles about abortion. but when we said that, we meant we're not fighting for the next five years but for the next 50. and what will our children think of the pro-life movement when it's headed by the 'grab 'em by the p—y' guy?

larger newspapers generally hire scores of part-time workers to deliver newspapers. the mail service is more cost-effective for smaller publications, which can rack up additional discounts by delivering them to postal facilities on their own and presorting items in the sequence of a letter carrier's route, allowing postal workers to pick up the newspaper bundle and start their routines.
the u.s. strategic interest is to settle a dispute that russia uses to blackmail serbia into submission and keep the balkans perpetually destabilized, vajdich said. solving the kosovo question would virtually eliminate russia's leverage over serbia and its influence in the balkans. achieving this should be one of the u.s.'s core interests in europe.
concept has always been king for restaurants. the concept, or business plan, informs everything: what food is served and how, the decor and tableware, the marketing and target customers, the selection of employees, the location, even the name of the place. the success of a restaurant, the thinking went, flowed directly from the originality of its concept and its owners' ability to stick to it. straying from the plan was an indication of weakness, and a sure warning sign to customers and investors that the business was doomed.
— tariffs, not jobs for the industrial u.s. peter s. goodman at the nyt: plants in every direction shut down and moved their operations to mexico, succumbing to the relentless pressure to cut costs in an age of globalization. not ebw electronics. as the decades passed, the family-owned business stayed put, on the eastern edge of lake michigan, churning out lights for the auto industry. but now, the company's management is reluctantly mulling the possibility of moving its production to mexico to escape the tariffs that president trump has put on imported components, his primary weapons in a trade war waged in the name of bringing jobs home to america.

the taliban recognized the consequences of being perceived as a pariah state in the 1990s. despite the taliban's formal control of the government of afghanistan from 1996-2001, only pakistan, saudi arabia and the united arab emirates formally recognized taliban leadership. two decades later, taliban leadership has encouraged greater openness toward aid agencies, driven in large part by a hope for political recognition and an improvement in its public image.

despite the turnaround, storm clouds lie ahead. experts have been using the 2003 sars outbreak to gauge the potential fallout from the coronavirus on global growth, and a 2004 study from the brookings institution, korea university and the australian national university estimated that the outbreak delivered a $40 billion hit to the global economy; that would amount to about $56 billion today, adjusting for inflation. but the stakes are far higher now, as china is now one of the world's most vital economic engines: its gross domestic product is roughly $13 trillion, compared with $1.6 trillion during the sars outbreak. even if the virus is contained quickly, economists are predicting china's growth rate will fall to between 3 and 4 percent this quarter.

trump's great strength — and his frightening emptiness — stem from the same character trait: he lives in the moment and is therefore liberated to take actions that more studious leaders might shy away from. his transactional focus has allowed him to take advantage of richard nixon's madman theory, the notion that a president who is willing to be perceived as tough, unpredictable and even unhinged can force an enemy to make concessions for fear of suffering an immoderate attack. threatening to bomb iran's cultural sites, and then backing away after his own defense secretary said it would be a war crime, comes easily to a president who cares mainly about winning the moment. transaction complete, he moves on to the next deal with the slate clean, at least in his own mind.

democrats have signaled a willingness to approve $1.3 billion for border security as part of a broader spending bill, and a portion of that money could be used to replace and repair existing sections of wall and fencing. but they have drawn the line at the use of any additional taxpayer money for the construction of a new wall.
still, democrats point to the huge support among their own members for the idea. several democrats have offered bills requiring medicare price negotiations, but the most popular — offered by rep. lloyd doggett (d-tex.) — has 104 co-sponsors. welch said he holds out hope trump would sign such a measure (assuming democrats could somehow get it through the senate), given the support he expressed on the campaign trail.
in a letter to lawmakers friday, the white house and the department of homeland security made a fresh appeal to amend immigration laws they denounce as legal loopholes and blame for creating a border security and humanitarian crisis. but the chance of reaching consensus for such technical fixes to u.s. immigration statutes is growing more remote, buried by the pitched battle over a structure new house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) calls immoral.

as far as tourism numbers go, antarctica's might not seem high, especially compared to the tens of millions of people each year visiting countries such as france, spain and the united states. but in antarctica, a remote and increasingly vulnerable continent whose primary residents are researchers, tourism comes at an environmental cost. the cruise ships bringing travelers from chilean and argentine ports, for example, also carry air pollutants that can further devastate the region.

we're going to pass that, he said. it's just a question of how.
this fealty to d.c. geography allows natives to give the occasional gaffe, like the suggestion of a silver line (or a green line!) in 1984, a pass. and it makes clear how obvious and often other productions try to get toronto or some other bland locale to stand in for d.c.: ww84 joins breach as one of the rare movies to get the geography — the look and the feel and the traffic — of d.c. just right, and as such, to present the city as a distinct place, rather than an unimportant one.
hopefully late this year, life should begin to feel similar to pre-pandemic times. however, it is likely that both great vigilance and some social distancing will still be needed, particularly if the population is not nearly all vaccinated. in addition, we may well require periodic immunization against the current and, possibly, other emerging coronavirus variants.

washington is often home to congressional public policy experiments, and it has operated a voucher program for several years. i've witnessed enterprising, low-income families take full advantage of vouchers. many parents work multiple jobs and cobble together vouchers, scholarships and tuition payments to cover the costs of independent schools. while vouchers can open doors to strong schools to underserved students in rare instances, this approach also allows public dollars to flow to private schools without full transparency about their results (test scores, graduation rates, college matriculation rates). certainly, they do not get equal accountability.
ajit ghose, an economist at the institute for human development in delhi, says that india needs to generate jobs not only for fresh entrants to the workforce — who number 6 million to 8 million a year, according to his estimate — but also for people, mostly women, who are working far less than they would be if they could get stable jobs that paid a decent wage. ghose has calculated that india has at least 104 million such surplus workers.

the one thing businesses crave from policymakers is stability, because they need to be able to make long-term plans, democratic strategist erik smith says. when i am talking to c-suite people, i'm not hearing left versus right. i'm hearing about stability versus instability. business leaders know there are going to be winners and losers; they just want a process in place with clear rules of the road.
members bring their life experiences to the policymaking table. increased numbers of women in the republican caucus means more voices articulating experiences as mothers, daughters, individual workers and employers trying to navigate a challenging economy or manage caregiving responsibilities. the newly elected republican women bring more diversity to a historically white male gop conference, including two korean americans, two latinas and one native american. given these backgrounds, they may emphasize different issues and propose alternative policy prescriptions.

now all this might be fine if the foreign system allowed judgments that violate americans' free speech rights; but a federal statute already largely precludes the enforcement of such judgments. or it might be fine if the foreign system discriminated against litigants based on race or sex or religion, or if it was fundamentally corrupt. but this is canada, a civilized country. much as american law respects the right to trial by jury, does it really make sense to refuse to enforce canadian judgments (or english or french or german judgments), just because we have a somewhat different system of civil procedure?

the right approach to pandemic relief is to be generous to people and businesses that need help and stingy to those that don't. that means enhanced unemployment checks for the long-term unemployed and continuing government support of businesses that are suffering from government-imposed pandemic restriction regardless of the cost. it also means saying no to the vast majority of americans who haven't lost their jobs or suffered large drops in income during the pandemic. help for the truly needy, not handouts or hands off, is both good policy and good politics.

in part, that's because the democratic party is itself split over energy and climate policy. the vocal progressive wing, personified in members such as representative alexandria ocasio-cortez and senator bernie sanders, favors not just big spending on green initiatives, but also far-reaching mandates against fossil fuels and supporting environmental and social justice measures. on the other side stand members favoring a more cautious approach, not least because they hail from states where fossil-fuel production and distribution is a big source of economic activity, jobs and donor dollars. these include both senators from new mexico, as well as senators in important swing states such as pennsylvania and ohio. but one democratic senator personifies this wing above all others: joe manchin of west virginia.

to purchase loyalty and information, the cia gave cash to warlords, governors, parliamentarians, even religious leaders, according to the interviews. the u.s. military and other agencies also abetted corruption by doling out payments or contracts to unsavory afghan power brokers in a misguided quest for stability.

nervous investors seek refuge in yen and gold. wsj's ira iosebashvili: uneven economic data and volatility in stocks have accelerated a surge into assets perceived as relatively safe, highlighting the unease felt by many investors at the start of 2019. the japanese yen is up nearly 5% against the dollar since markets began sliding at the end of last year's third quarter. that move picked up speed after weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and a sales warning from apple inc. last week bolstered fears of a global slowdown.
leo came to be known in the white house as coordinator of all outside coalition activity regarding judicial nominations, according to a 2003 email by a white house aide to kavanaugh and others.
thiessen was at it again today on the national review web site: the cia program he is effectively shutting down is the reason why america has not been attacked again after 9/11. he has removed the tool that is singularly responsible for stopping al-qaeda from flying planes into the library tower in los angeles, heathrow airport, and london's canary warf, and blowing up apartment buildings in chicago, among other plots. it's not even the end of inauguration week, and obama is already proving to be the most dangerous man ever to occupy the oval office.
but make no mistake: not building a building doesn't help a low-income person find a place to live. nobody has ever found a home because a court kept a vacant lot vacant. only new mixed-income housing, preserving existing affordable housing, protecting tenants and policies that create jobs can alleviate displacement.
you cannot do financial regulatory policy without some measure of trust in regulators' judgment, said a former obama-era treasury department official. blackrock's efforts were not just focused on policy changes but were focused on undermining that trust.
the shell plant is licensed to produce up to 1.6 million tons of polyethylene annually, a process that could involve emitting up to 522 tons of volatile organic compounds and 348 tons of nitrogen oxides annually. peduto said those emissions are equal to adding 450,000 vehicles to ­pittsburgh-area highways, severely undercutting the city's goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.

trump is in a glass house on this issue. not only is his record on racial issues what it is — most notably on the central park five and charlottesville — but he has vocally supported the stop-and-frisk policy. during the 2016 campaign, he proposed bringing it nationwide, and he reiterated his support as recently as 2018. he could say bloomberg's description of the policy is crass, but it was widely known that the policy did pretty much what bloomberg said it did, and trump backed it.
in 1948, time magazine journalist whittaker chambers testified that he had been a courier for the communist underground in the 1930s and that alger hiss, a former state department official, was a member of his cell. while chambers's sexuality was not explicitly raised at the time, hiss's allies strongly insinuated that the ex-communist's allegations were motivated by a desire to seek revenge against the man who had spurned his romantic overtures.

adam isacson, a security analyst at the washington office on latin america, said there appears to be little political incentive for conservatives to hash out a deal if it doesn't deliver on trump's signature issue. with trump eyeing a reelection bid amid increasing pressure from his conservative base, the debate over the wall could dominate washington for the foreseeable future.
those democrats, now in charge, say the further mueller's probe progresses, the more endangered he may be. and they have no faith that acting attorney general matthew g. whitaker — who ignored justice department ethics recommendations to recuse himself from supervising mueller's probe — will stand up to trump if he orders mueller's firing.

not all the pressure came from competitiveness; domestic firms barely stand up against the foreign ones. in 2018, the ministry of commerce opened a one-year anti-dumping investigation into japanese and taiwanese exporters of vertical-machine centers – key equipment manufacturing facilities for cars and other more sophisticated processes. at the time, as i noted, it was a case of playing spoilsport: the numbers didn't warrant the probe, nor did the impact on prices. machinery orders had already been slowing, as had shipments for bearings, a proxy for the industry. citing the complexity, the government extended the case in 2019. by april 2020, it was determined that everything had been fair after all and no duties would be imposed.
amid a slate of partisan and bipartisan proposals, another conservative immigration plan may emerge in the coming days. according to a lawmaker and a gop aide familiar with the plans, house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte (r-va.) is expected to unveil a bill as soon as this week that would address daca in exchange for a raft of conservative priorities on immigration.
trump added: as you know, president obama fired him, and essentially so did i.
during a christmas visit to troops in iraq, trump said that he would deny any request from the military to extend the mission in syria. they said again, recently, 'can we have more time?'  trump said of u.s. generals. i said: 'nope. you can't have any more time. you've had enough time.' we've knocked them out, he said of the islamic state. we've knocked them silly.

in the view of the world, the trump era provided no shortage of captivating spectacle, sometimes grim. wednesday's events went beyond that, into disconcerting territory: far-right attacks on democracy made literal. chilling footage from the scene circulated globally, of lawmakers fleeing, capitol police with their guns drawn inside the capitol building and a mob of angry trump supporters running loose in the halls. one photo showed a man sitting in the chair of a member of house speaker nancy pelosi's (d-calif.) staff, his feet on the desk. another showed a man appearing to carry away the speaker's lectern.
among the questions that the white house did not resolve on thursday were these: what should be done with terrorists who cannot be tried in american courts, either because evidence against them was obtained by torture or because intelligence is too sensitive to use in court? should some interrogation methods remain secret to keep al qaeda from training to resist them? how can the united states make sure prisoners transferred to other countries will not be tortured?
trump acknowledged on dec. 5 that the next four years of foreign policy in china and iran would be under someone else's control.
if trump respects power above all else, as it seems he does, it's not surprising he'd respect pelosi.
it's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. we are encouraged, hopeful. the issue isn't buried. candidates speak about it. it's not a movement in the ghetto. after eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the white house at the start of the administration — i felt like i was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years.
but the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. his decision to order a strike that killed iranian military commander qasem soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on european cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the middle east and in the transatlantic relationship between the united states and its closest allies.

reading the trump statement advocating the spread of nuclear weapons has no impact on opposition to the npt, regardless of whether it is attributed to trump or evans and regardless of the party affiliation of the reader. indeed, reading trump's statement actually lowers republican opposition to the treaty slightly.
democrats may opt to pursue some priorities through the budget reconciliation process, which would require a simple majority to pass. the option enable democrats to tackle certain pieces of their agenda, but not others, per bloomberg news's steven dennis:
high school sophomore sophie kaplan is marching in a bright yellow flowered sundress, but the sentiment on her poster is hardly so sunny: why should i study for a future i won't have? she thinks about climate change every day, she tells me. she reads about how we're on the brink and hears her teachers and parents tell her that it's up to her generation to fix things. i don't understand why i should be in school if the world is burning, she says. what's the point of working on my education if we don't deal with this first?

people who interacted with trump on wednesday said they found him in a fragile and volatile state. he spent the afternoon and evening cocooned at the white house and listening only to a small coterie of loyal aides — including meadows, deputy chief of staff dan scavino, personnel director johnny mcentee and policy adviser stephen miller. many of his top confidants — meadows, son-in-law jared kushner and first lady melania trump, among others — were publicly silent.

indicative of how damaging homosexuality was considered to be at the time was the best-selling 1959 novel of washington politics advise and consent, later made into a hit film directed by otto preminger. the book's plot centered around a patriotic senator who committed suicide after one of his unscrupulous colleagues threatened to expose a fleeting, gay wartime affair. although advise and consent was unusual for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay character, it nevertheless presented the homosexual's plight as so drastic that death was considered preferable to having his secret disclosed.
i said that this bill is going to protect defendants that we have under investigation, he said in a recent interview. and if they don't like the truth, well, i don't know what to tell 'em.
the most glaring fact about the whelan case is how little noise it is making in russia. previous espionage cases were instant media circuses. remember the arrest of u.s. diplomat ryan fogle in 2013, caught in the street in a blond wig and carrying a map and compass? or the trio of british diplomats accused in 2006 of using a fake rock and a network of human rights and media activists to gather intelligence? or edmond pope, the pennsylvania businessman arrested in 2000 and accused of trying to buy the plans for a hypersonic torpedo?

naomi said her political activism was sparked a few years ago when she began asking questions in school about germany's liberal immigration policies. she said the backlash from teachers and other students hardened her skepticism about mainstream german thinking. more recently, she said that watching young people joining weekly fridays for future protests inspired by greta helped spur her opposition to climate change activism.

at the heart of a legal fight over the executive orders will be familiar constitutional questions — and some novel ones. since the country's founding, legal experts have clashed over where the federal government's authority ends and state authority begins. from a basic perspective, the fcc enjoys the upper hand: part of its reason for existence is to smooth over differences in state laws, said jonathan turley, a constitutional law professor at george washington university.
the fbi put priority on seizing the russian compounds in maryland and new york as a response to the election interference. aerial images of the facilities showed how the compounds were modified, presumably to enhance their espionage capabilities. when the russians evacuated the compounds, they stripped them of antennas, electronics, computers, file cabinets and other gear, officials said.
the los angeles times editorial board writes: with executive orders signed thursday, president obama has begun the rehabilitation of this country's reputation when it comes to the treatment of suspected terrorists. but the orders contain ambiguities that demonstrate how hard it will be to unwind the tangle that president bush created.

even many trump supporters were aghast. a number of aides resigned, including the first lady's chief of staff, a spokeswoman and the white house social secretary, officials said.

though that voting bloc represents a small percentage of georgia's 7.2 million registered voters, according to the secretary of state's office data, election analysts say it's enough to influence outcomes in the two dead heat races and, ultimately, control of the u.s. senate, during an especially polarizing election season marked by record voter turnout and campaigns that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
mr. sweeney had expressed a desire to stay on at the pentagon as recently as last week, per the journal. some officials believed he would provide continuity during the transition from mr. mattis to mr. shanahan. but, under pressure from the white house, mr. shanahan informed mr. sweeney on friday that he was removing him as chief of staff friday.
adding up apprehensions and inadmissibles — as the trump administration began to do in early 2018 on cbp's website — produces a much higher total than simply reporting apprehensions. the combined total was above 60,000 in october and november each, which is roughly 2,000 a day.
today, critics argue that the price of insulin has far outpaced any innovations. in the past decade alone, u.s. insulin list prices have tripled, according to an analysis of data from ibm watson health. in 1996, when eli lilly debuted its humalog brand of insulin, the list price of a 10-milliliter vial was $21. the price of the same vial is now $275. those costs can be compounded by the multiple vials that diabetics may require to survive each month. it's a very big problem, says robert gabbay, chief medical officer at the joslin diabetes center in boston. it's a tragic barrier to care.
trump is widely expected to appoint someone to the vacant post of federal reserve vice chairman in charge of bank oversight, a position left open during the obama administration. tarullo essentially filled that role, but would have probably found his powers and influence curtailed by a trump-appointee. trump has promised to dismantle 2010's regulatory reform package, known as the dodd-frank act, signing an executive order last week calling for a review of the rules that govern the financial industry.

— for 38 million low-income americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. the snap program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our post colleagues damian paletta and erica werner report. congress has not allocated funding for snap beyond january, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of february's payments, according to past disbursements. a disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. an agriculture department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.
the result: over a million military-connected children, most of whom attend public schools, are exposed to the vagaries of our educational system far more than their peers in civilian families. as the military child education coalition reports, there is no consistent school-based data on the academic health of these students and without such data, decisions about children, time, money, and initiatives are at risk of being based on supposition rather than reality. military parents are often left to make career-related decisions based on keeping kids in schools they are comfortable with or moving their families and placing kids in unfamiliar schools where they might wind up either ahead of or behind their new classmates.

the bucks, who played host to the detroit pistons on wednesday, took the court like usual and claimed the opening tip-off. giannis antetokounmpo, the nba's back-to-back mvp, claimed possession and then tossed the ball out of bounds as both teams and the bucks' coaching staff took a knee in protest. the pistons then took possession and repeated the demonstration, with blake griffin tossing the ball out of bounds as both teams took a knee. milwaukee then took possession and the game resumed.
northam still has a long, dark winter to make good on his commitment to racial justice and criminal justice reform. the prospect of widespread vaccination by late spring is no excuse for inaction. with coronavirus-related deaths projected to double by april 1 in virginia, there will be widespread suffering among inmates and staff. northam could lessen the pain. with african americans dramatically overrepresented in virginia's prisons, the governor's use of clemency would be a powerful sign that he is serious about racial equality and fulfilling our joint humanity.

tom steyer, the billionaire who has been campaigning to impeach trump as he ponders his own presidential bid, is returning soon for an event about education reform. he said in an interview that trump's actions in the past few weeks had added to what was already highly charged enthusiasm. he specified the government shutdown and the departure of defense secretary jim mattis.
renee belisle, a curriculum specialist for denver public schools, says that the standards, which passed narrowly in colorado, have played a hugely significant role in a rewrite of the district's high school science curriculum, which now integrates climate change into biology, physics and chemistry classes. each climate change unit contains an action item; as early as middle school, students are taught that steps such as changing your diet or turning off the lights can have an effect. that arc of ending with the empowerment is a way to help mitigate that pessimism that could develop, belisle says, particularly with kids, who might feel disenfranchised.

more than half a dozen statehouses are considering bills that would penalize medical professionals — and, in at least one case, parents — who give young people access to puberty-blocking medicines and other treatments. conservative lawmakers argue that they are protecting vulnerable children who may be experimenting with their identity from making life-altering changes to their bodies, a characterization that advocates for transgender youths call misinformed and dangerous.
the organization in previous decades was seen as less partisan. but its strong support for netanyahu during the obama administration, even as the two leaders clashed over settlements and the iran nuclear deal, thrilled republicans and offended many democrats.

in january 2003, leo called white house officials, including kavanaugh, to object to a plan by bush to weigh in on affirmative action. bush was going to criticize the practice but praise racial diversity. leo complained that praising diversity would disgust any conservative who thinks that this is a matter of principle, according to a previously unreported email by a white house official describing one of the calls.

imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the federalist society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response. acs was very explicitly founded to do the same kind of work that the federalist society has done, fredrickson says. we, too, have chapters across the country. … we also organize events. we have a group of scholars and experts who work with us on efforts to explain the constitution and our laws to the broader public. but the acs still lacks the reach of the federalist society, as measured in chapters and budgets. fredrickson attributes the gap to legal institutions and opportunities on the left being more diffuse than on the right. also: they do get a lot more corporate support than we do because it's in the interest of the corporations, she says. they want to get rid of regulations.
although cho, with two children, has a no-shoe policy at home, she considers doormats a decorative and a fun way to greet guests and help catch dirt, water and snow before shoes are placed inside the door. if you have one main entry, cho says to go with one you really love that makes a statement or has a fun greeting. for any secondary entries, she suggests coordinating the look of those mats: they could all be exactly the same for consistency or just have a similar vibe. for interior entryways, she recently designed some washable interior entry rugs for lorena canals. for exterior doors, she likes vinyl chilewich mats, which are mold-, mildew- and chlorine-resistant, with a water-blocking, slip-resistant vinyl backing. the company's latest design — simple stripe ($55, chilewich.com) — has a functional stripe made of pvc yarns that scrape away debris.

by anonymously revealing those findings to affected festivalgoers, researchers persuaded more than two-thirds of them to hand over other substances in their possession. drug-related hospital admissions fell 95 percent compared with the previous year — a trend researchers said was largely associated with the on-site drug testing trial. in a separate experiment, researchers in austria similarly noticed that tests raised awareness about the dangers of drug consumption.

fortunately, i'm glad to say that the dean has written to the ayn rand institute to extend my [i.e., the dean's] apologies and acknowledged that the administrator's action was not in keeping with ucla law's — or my — vigorous commitment to support free speech and respectful debate. it also failed to adhere to our commitment that university policies be applied in a content-neutral manner. and the dean stressed that the school was taking steps to prevent such occurrences, by beefing up training and procedures. i know the dean pretty well, and i think she's quite sincere about this.

but in researching the link between noise pollution and heart disease, experts warn that there are also factors that can complicate the findings. for instance, people who live in heavily populated areas more likely to be plagued by noise are also exposed to more particle pollution in the air, which can also cause heart problems. and, people who live in such areas may also have a different socioeconomic status, meaning they may not have the same access to health care or healthful foods.
one of the consequences of this pandemic, in which disease can be spread by asymptomatic people, is that we now stop and think about every potential interaction. after all, it's not just, if i eat at this restaurant, can a staff member or another diner make me sick? but, if i eat at this restaurant, could i make my server sick? as a result, an increasing number of establishments turned to technology that let customers place orders and pay from their phones, in an attempt to limit the face time between staff and customers. i have to admit, i kind of liked it.
an additional challenge this time around is the space race-type international competition in vaccine development. china and russia are promoting inoculations with little or no data validating their effectiveness in large studies. india has licensed an indigenous product developed by local firm bharat biotech international ltd. in clinical trial mode — those receiving the shots will be tracked and that will supposedly prove its efficacy. that's because phase three experimental data, which do exactly that, aren't yet available.

we can sketch out three distinct eras of time reckoning between antiquity and the present. the earliest calendars were linked to the movement of the sun, moon and planets. an enduring legacy of this: within the days of our week are encoded the names of the sun, moon and five planets visible to ancient babylonian astronomers. the story of social time since then has been a gradual decoupling from natural reference points. first the seven-day week broke free of the lunar cycle, becoming, sociologist eviatar zerubavel argues, the first major rhythm of human activity that is totally oblivious to nature, resting on mathematical regularity alone. as such, he writes, the week ought to be regarded as one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of human civilization. with the industrial revolution, clock time liberated the workday from solar time and established labor routines organized by schedules — the 9-to-5 job being the ultimate expression of this. in the 21st century, work has escaped the bounds of the 9-to-5 schedule, organized instead around what media scholar robert hassan calls network time. under network time, we're expected to do our jobs whenever the task demands it, no matter what our local time is.

the taliban exercises control or influence over at least half of afghanistan, and civilian support is important to the group's efforts to further consolidate control. often during civil wars, armed groups provide services to civilians to win their support — and gain access to food, shelter, recruits and information. while armed groups could use force to extract these resources from civilians, territorial control leads armed groups to expect sustained interactions with civilians — and armed groups generally find it more efficient to develop a less coercive relationship with communities under their rule.

dec. 9, 2018, issue: tomorrow, dec. 10, is human rights day, first recognized by the united nations in 1948. for artist lydia ortiz, who was born in the philippines, the concept of human rights first presented itself when, as a child, she visited the site of the bataan death march — the 1942 transfer of american and filipino prisoners of war by the japanese army. the lessons she learned about that historical episode continue to resonate with her as strongly as ever. with all the critical conflicts happening in multiple nations today, she says, we should remind ourselves of our obligation to monitor and enforce human rights for all oppressed humans everywhere.
two stories came out wednesday suggesting that the administration believed it had achieved multiple triumphs. according to my washington post colleagues john hudson and souad mekhennet, the trump administration sideswiped its european allies on iran: if they refused to call out tehran and initiate an arcane dispute mechanism in the deal, the united states would impose a 25 percent tariff on european automobiles, the trump officials warned, according to european officials familiar with the conversations. within days, the three countries would formally accuse iran of violating the deal. as hudson and mekhennet note, this is an unprecedented use of coercive threats against treaty allies.

what's often underrecognized about trump's emergence in national politics is that he was the best-known figure willing to fully immerse himself in those fights encouraged in far-right media. he flirted with a 2012 presidential run by leaning into birtherism, building a foothold with sketchier conservative media outlets by doing so.
parties face a dilemma when writing rules. if the rules weaken leaders — for example, by taking away their right to nominate members for the rules committee — those leaders may not be able to pass important parts of the party's policy agenda. but if the rules make leaders powerful, it becomes harder for opponents to challenge them, even if a large faction prefers new leaders.
canada cut diplomatic ties with iran about a decade ago. trudeau said that while there had been openness from iranian officials to involve canada in the investigation, access had not yet been given to them. iran wanted to keep the black boxes there but told ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky that ukrainian investigators would have access to them, trudeau said.

some 800,000 federal workers are affected, including around 350,000 who have been furloughed while the rest stay on the job wondering whether they will end up getting paid. in past shutdowns, congress has approved retroactive pay once the impasse has been resolved. but the many government contractors affected may never make up their lost paychecks.

consider the economic pressure story first. it would be easy to infer that trump's economic pressure had the desired effect — except that, as hudson reports, it seems as if the best that could be said is that the threat of economic pressure did not ratchet up tensions even further. u.s. officials acknowledged to hudson and mekhennet that europeans had been signaling their intention to trigger the dispute resolution for weeks. what was the effect of this pressure? officials in britain, france and germany say that they had planned to initiate the mechanism but that trump's threat nearly caused them to backtrack, out of concern that they could be viewed as stooges of washington if word of the threat leaked.

why would the taliban — a group known for the systematic destruction of women's access to education — not only agree to but initiate talks on the provision of education? the taliban continues to fight the government of afghanistan, and the armed group's political goal remains unchanged: to reestablish a strict islamist system of government, a shift that would probably reverse many of the rights granted to women in the 2004 post-taliban constitution.

much of that shift, it is safe to assume, is a function of viewership having moved to one america or newsmax, places where accuracy is often a secondary concern. their rhetoric is centered on trump at the moment, but it is also deeply opportunistic. once the election fades as a subject of speculation, something else will fill the vacuum.
our nation's drug supply chain is highly complex, so we routinely engage with elected officials and regulators to share our knowledge, experience and occasionally, recommendations, mckesson said. there is nothing inappropriate about companies communicating with policymakers in a transparent, law-abiding way to foster a more effective working relationship with the government.

because vaccine doses must be used within a certain time frame once they have been removed from refrigeration, some lucky individuals who are not in priority groups have been able to get early doses. this happened, for instance, at a giant foods store in northeast washington, d.c., where a pharmacist flagged down a law school student who happened to be shopping at the store after several first responders missed their appointments, the post's lola fadulu reports . the decision was in line with guidance from the d.c. department of health, which instructs providers to use any vaccine doses that might otherwise go to waste.

it cleveland doesn't turn around and trade osweiler to another team, which is not out of the question, it will essentially have paid $16 million — osweiler's cost this year before he can be cut with no further obligation — for a second-round pick. that may seem like a steep price, although the nature of this deal, akin to what nba teams have done but essentially unprecedented in the nfl, makes it a difficult judgment to render with any certainty. in any event, if it helps land the highly regarded garoppolo, the cost could well have been worth it, especially considering that the browns entered this offseason with over $100 million salary-cap space.

warren's announcement can be fairly seen as the start of the 2020 democratic primary. the question for democratic voters is whom to nominate; the question for the press is whether we've learned anything from a 2016 campaign that made fools out of many experts. plenty of first-look commentary on warren is repeating the mistake that led many to suggest that donald trump could not win the 2016 republican nomination, or that sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) would be, at best, a token challenger for hillary clinton.
then there are conservatives and defenders of the rule of law striving to remind us of four core conservative principles: free trade, robust legal immigration, defense of the rule of law and opposition to aggressive authoritarian regimes, including russia. an umbrella organization dubbed defending democracy together takes on tariffs, anti-immigrant exclusionism and assaults on the constitution and democratic norms. the group also urges republicans to return to american leadership in the world and defense of free peoples:

but democrats' euphoria was soon quashed when a judicial panel ruled the race a tie — 11,608 votes each — and left its outcome to the whims of a lottery. a state election official on thursday picked the name of the winner — republican david e. yancey — from what may now be the country's most photographed ceramic bowl.

carson has long criticized federal efforts to desegregate american neighborhoods as failed socialist experiments. when questioned about the agency's intention regarding the fair housing provision during congressional hearings last spring, carson testified that it costs a lot of money and man hours to do that analysis. he signaled that he intended to focus on building affordable housing across all communities by deregulating and easing zoning restrictions.
one of the reasons blackstone is so successful, for example, is that as one of the biggest private-equity firms, it gets a first look at most of the best investment opportunities. everyone who works at, or invests with, blackstone benefits from that kind of market power. and within blackstone, schwarzman has the sole discretion in setting the bonuses for top executives, according to its annual proxy filings.

the intellectual life of the american right since sen. joe mccarthy's rise to prominence in 1950 can be seen partially as a series of flirtations with conspiracists and a dedicated reluctance to read fringe crackpots out of its ranks. yes, william f. buckley jr.'s national review attacked john birch society founder robert welch, who called dwight eisenhower a dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy, in an iconic moment of movement history.
as people age, factors change. older adults may experience their own or their partner's health conditions, a need for assistance with activities of daily living or the loss of a spouse. because of these and other changes, an increasing number of older adults are choosing intermediate care settings, such as assisted living, which is the fastest-growing segment of long-term care for older adults.
and past performance is no guarantee of future returns. bolivia is now clearly having trouble adjusting to lower commodity prices: since 2015 it's been running large deficits, drawing down its international reserves far too fast as the government resists the kind of spending cuts it will take to adjust to the new normal. keep that up for another few years, and bolivia could find itself on the same downward trajectory venezuela is now on.

of immediate importance, democratic control would affect the process of confirming biden's cabinet nominees. with democrats in charge, hearings and votes could move ahead more swiftly, with the prospect of having nominees for the state and defense departments and perhaps a few other key positions ready by inauguration day. if republicans remained in control, confirmation delays would be inevitable and potentially costly, and some of biden's nominees would struggle to be confirmed.

concerns that trump may reach for the military to retain power as he enters the final chapter of resistance to the election's result have grown sharper in recent days, partly after his former national security adviser, retired army lt. gen. michael flynn, floated a declaration of martial law and a rerun of the election overseen by the military in a mid-december oval office meeting — a suggestion flynn also has made publicly in the media. trump, meanwhile, pressured georgia's secretary of state to find 11,780 votes he needs to win the state.

at other times, understanding that they had to court the conspiracy-minded activists of the base, the party's leaders went out of their way to confer legitimacy on extremists. take the gop's relationship with christian coalition leader pat robertson, who won four states in the 1988 republican presidential primary contest. in 1991, robertson published the new world order, holding that scheming government pooh-bahs were working to set up world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all. he even suggested that president george h.w. bush was complicit in establishing this new world order. still, republicans wanted votes and donations from robertson's acolytes, so newt gingrich, oliver north, william bennett, jack kemp, jesse helms and dinesh d'souza all happily spoke at his road to victory conferences. sen. bob dole, a pillar of the republican establishment and at the time a presidential candidate, told robertson's followers in 1995 that i am proud to stand up here and say that i've been awarded a 100 percent voting record in '93 and 100 percent in 1994 and 100 percent in 1995 from the christian coalition.

much of the information received may have distracted u.s. officials from the growing insurgency. for instance, the cpa received a number of tips about weapons of mass destruction (wmd), which may help explain why the united states kept searching for wmd for more than 18 months after the invasion had begun. several informants claimed to personally know where these weapons were hidden and who was handling them.
a lot of that could change as candidates pile into the race, but warren's campaign, at the moment, is taking full advantage of the pent-up interest. at every stop, she has stopped to take pictures with anyone willing to wait for one; her team has grabbed copies of her books (or even photographs and baseballs, which sometimes are passed around by autograph hunters) and returned them to voters, signed. it's more like the approach clinton's campaign took in 2016, and sen. cory booker's pre-campaign is taking now, than what fans of sanders found last cycle.

that outcome underscored one of the biggest barriers to guthrie's work: education and youth groups don't always see climate change as having a direct link to children if they're not being displaced by a disaster — and sometimes not even then. still, more schools have picked up the s4ca resolution model, and in september, rep. barbara lee (d-calif.) introduced a nonbinding resolution acknowledging climate change as a social justice issue and supporting more climate education. by failing to address climate change in a meaningful way, we are failing our children, she said in a floor speech, and they know it.

this particular post from a staff member on his personal facebook page clearly does not represent the values and culture of babson college, it said in a statement.

alejandro osorio, the 39-year-old owner of arepa lady, encountered that other america only through the filter of social media clips his friends posted from fox news and other conservative sites. pundits called ocasio-cortez a hypocrite when the avowed socialist wore expensive clothes, derided her after she flubbed distinguishing the three branches of government, mocked her meager savings account and, last month, questioned her fortitude after she said she needed a week-long break for self-care.

trump objects to the agreement because he claims it makes so-called chain migration (family-based immigration) and the lottery system worse, meaning we must take in large numbers of people from high crime … countries which are doing badly. that openly concedes that trump wants fewer people from those countries here.
biden has also advocated expanding access to medicaid and affordable health care, beefing up unemployment insurance and creating a national jobs corps. he wants to offer more federal support to entrepreneurs, promote clean energy, rebuild the nation's infrastructure and enhance the economic relief measures that were initiated with the cares act last spring and extended modestly since then.
in a news conference with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, bolton said that the defense of israel and other friends in the region is absolutely assured, that the kurds and others would be protected, and that the administration would make sure isis is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again.

if it continues to happen to the other female candidates, it will be more obvious that there are gender biases at work, palmieri said. you can have legitimate reasons for why you don't support a warren candidacy. you have to hope that people look deeper when it's something intangible, like something like likability.
universities can impose content-neutral rules, and likely even content-based but viewpoint-neutral rules, on what goes on in their hallways. they could, for instance, ban all sales of books. they could ban such sales by outside groups. they could require permission before any sales of anything take place, so long as the permission is granted or denied without regard to the viewpoint expressed by the materials being sold — indeed, it appears that ucla has such a policy. but they can't discriminate based on the book's supposedly offensive viewpoint, even if the hallway is viewed as a so-called nonpublic forum. (see rosenberger v. rector (1995).) moreover, even if they apply such no-sales rules in a content-neutral way, that would only justify telling the group not to sell the book, rather than telling the group to stop displaying the book. as i said, this was a clear error on the administrator's part; i'm sorry that it happened at my own law school.

early in the pandemic, cities across the country began closing streets to traffic to provide more room for socially distanced running and biking. and by summer, as restaurants took their first steps toward reopening, they began to stake their own claims to the streets, moving tables into pedestrianized roads. the result was charming, comfortable and provided a sense of quasi-normalcy after spring's stay-at-home orders.

as society becomes more individualistic, we have less accountability for putting our children's needs above the needs of all. this shift can also be attributed to how the family landscape is constantly changing. parents are tasked with co-parenting in arrangements that often don't follow the institutional blueprints of generations past.

the supreme court has recognized disparate-impact claims, but in a 2015 housing case, its use was upheld by a narrow 5-to-4 vote, in an opinion written by justice anthony m. kennedy, now retired. some conservatives have speculated that the new court, with justice brett m. kavanaugh in kennedy's place, might decide the same matter differently.

one change since clinton's defeat that may simplify strategies for female candidates is the #metoo movement, which created a heightened awareness about the shifting standards that women can face. that may have contributed to a growing willingness of 2018 candidates to call out what they see as sexist — and even racist — expectations.

cuomo's other likely argument, that the gop tax law violates the 10th amendment's guarantee of state sovereignty, may also not stand up in court, according to shanske. the 16th amendment gives congress the authority to institute a federal income tax, and the federal government has the authority to determine which deductions can be claimed.

warren's first message to voters is different, identifying the economic anxieties of voters and then immediately assigning blame. these aren't cracks families are falling into — they're traps, she says in her launch video. america's middle class is under attack. how did we get here? billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. and they enlisted politicians to cut them a bigger slice.

what alec soon learned was just how much his insulin would end up costing: more than $1,000 a month. the price of insulin — once modest — has skyrocketed in recent years, making the lifesaving medication a significant, even burdensome, expense, especially for the uninsured and underinsured. the costs are so heavy that they have driven some patients to ration their supplies of the drug in a dangerous gamble with life-threatening consequences.

once he became president, trump and the party similarly merged. as with the tea party movement, trump's focus was never policy but, instead, fringe cultural fights. this suited the establishment fairly well: by letting trump have his incendiary public persona, the gop got hundreds of new conservative judges, three supreme court justices and a massive tax-cut package. it meant a lot of looking the other way at trump's behavior and broad refusals to call out dishonesty and controversial comments, but for much of his term, it worked on a political level.

obama leaves for vacation on martha's vineyard. before he goes, he instructs aides to get consensus from u.s. intelligence agencies on russia's role and intentions, assess the vulnerabilities of the election system and seek bipartisan support to publicly condemn moscow. the aides face obstacles at every turn.
party and campaign officials said privately that they hoped trump wouldn't obsess over the lone defection and move on from impeachment, basking in his acquittal instead of engaging in a days-long tiff with romney. the president has firm control of the party and could dictate a strategy that is more aggressive, advisers said, if his pique at romney flares.
the governor had the summer months to plan for such releases, as health experts long predicted a second spike. with the opportunity for creating a thoughtful and regularized process squandered, clemency now would not be perfect. yet it would fulfill the core function implicit in the term clemency, with the state providing mercy at a moment of national crisis.

in that litany, anti-corruption legislation is filed under government; voting rights, including a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to vote, is filed under politics. it's more incremental than the sanders approach, but it grows out of a rationale for running, the sort of thing democrats believe hillary clinton never was able to do. warren, who has been accused of elitism (by republicans) since entering politics, connects every policy position to her identity and the years she spent (to use a phrase she's dropped) on the ragged edge of the middle class.

in the saturday call, trump told raffensperger that he risked facing criminal consequences if he didn't find enough votes to declare that the president had won the state. raffensperger responded that the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.

white, a former texas regulator who once called carbon dioxide a harmless trace gas that was merely plant food, was grilled at her confirmation hearing about her qualifications and past statements on climate change. in november, more than 300 scientists wrote to the senate opposing her appointment.
no one can truly know what happened in those final days. alec may not have realized that his condition was so serious, or perhaps he thought he would be fine, just as he had been when he was diagnosed. dka creates confusion as it progresses, and it can progress quickly, shutting down vital organs.
yet the recovery will continue to be k-shaped, as economists say, with already-well-off professionals heading steadily up as others struggle. indeed, the split could get worse if additional government aid doesn't materialize or if even more jobs and small businesses don't return because consumer habits shift. analysts at goldman sachs, for instance, think that economic growth will probably recover fully in 2021 but that employment won't return to precrisis levels until 2024.
because they were operating on a tight timetable, u.s. commanders first tried to clear areas where the taliban was deeply entrenched, such as helmand and kandahar provinces in southern afghanistan. the approach backfired when u.s. officials lavished aid on districts that remained supportive of the taliban yet neglected peaceful areas that sided with the government in kabul.
to combat an escalating opioid epidemic, the drug enforcement administration trained its sights in 2011 on mallinckrodt pharmaceuticals, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of the highly addictive generic painkiller oxycodone.
the new tpsa provides for sanctions on chinese communist party officials if they attempt to name a successor to the dalai lama, and it urges international coordination to quash recognition of any dalai lama picked by communist chinese leaders.
these corporate entities are powerful special interests. in 2017, the pharmaceutical and health product industry — which includes drug companies and pbms — spent nearly $280 million on lobbying, the biggest spender by far of 20 top industries, according to the center for responsive politics. even some patient advocacy organizations, like the american diabetes association, receive millions in funding from pharmaceutical companies. the industry also has a revolving door to government. alex azar, the head of the department of health and human services, was the president of eli lilly's u.s. division until 2017. under his watch, the price of the company's analog insulin doubled. now he is tasked with overseeing the government's plan to lower those same prices.
that late july day, this town along the banks of the kalamazoo river became the latest community affected by a ubiquitous class of compounds known as polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances, or pfas. for years, calls for the federal government to regulate the chemicals have been unsuccessful, and last year the trump administration tried to block publication of a study urging a much lower threshold of exposure.
our zero tolerance rule for serious hazing is in place, and will result in the permanent revocation of recognition of any chapter found to have violated the university's requirements.
britain's membership of the eu had meant the region's banks and investors could bypass the home exchanges of stocks such as paris-listed luxury-goods giant lvmh moët hennessy louis vuitton se and amsterdam-listed just eat takeaway.com nv, the big food-delivery company, and trade them in london over alternative venues … but with the brexit trade agreement taking effect jan. 1, that option ended.

goldman sees fed pausing. jan hatzius, the firm's chief economist, writes in a note this morning: fed officials are acutely focused on both financial conditions and the growth outlook, at a time when they have the luxury to be 'patient' because core pce inflation is at 1.9% year-on-year and unlikely to rise significantly for at least the next several months. this implies a pause in the rate hike process until conditions have settled down, as well as a strong incentive to sound market-friendly in the near term.
newsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on monday, the new york times's claire cain miller and jim tankersley report. but what's missing in the democrat's policy is a plan to fund it. it's the same challenge that has stymied the policy at the federal level, claire and jim write. around 80 percent of americans consistently say they support paid parental leave, and some republican lawmakers have joined democrats in embracing the idea. yet federal lawmakers have declined to pass tax increases or corporate mandates to make it a reality.
school choice is complex. for choice to change the odds for students, it must be paired with accountability and transparency.

tony roccaforte, senior security adviser at risk management company worldaware, said in an email that travelers should build redundancy into their plans, adding time for delays and preparing to improvise if conditions change.
nominees to positions such as defense secretary are typically fast-tracked so new presidents can have their national security team in place upon taking office, but in this case biden aides say republicans appear to be slow-walking the process. the president-elect raised that issue again wednesday.
ahead of the vote-counting in georgia, biden advisers had said that the results, whichever way they went, would not fundamentally change his approach as president. they said that he would seek the broadest possible consensus for his agenda and that he remains committed to his pledge to try to work constructively with republicans in congress, wherever possible.
trump was not alone in the white house on christmas eve, or on christmas. first lady melania trump cut short a trip to florida to join the president in washington from christmas eve onward.
the maryland municipal league and the maryland association of counties, which represent local governments, also objected to the one-for-one proposal. representatives for both organizations told the senate environment, health and education committee last week that cities don't have enough undeveloped, unforested land to accommodate that.
manchin has voted with the president more than 53 percent of the time, according to the website fivethirtyeight — more than any other current democratic senator.
while a 2017 law compels the government to auction another several hundred thousand acres by the end of 2024, the incoming administration may be able to overturn that requirement now that democrats have won control of the senate in the wake of tuesday's runoff elections in georgia.
my attitude did not change after i began working in a mine closer to home just outside clintwood, va. the company i worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. but the problem was still apparent. we would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.
wow, that wasn't the message i wanted to convey! was i wrong to approach it the way i did? i couldn't imagine saying my daughter just didn't want to play with her kid. how to help kids understand white lies in a way that retains the value of being honest?
this advice resonates with what i had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: much of the federalist society's influence comes not from its very public washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. and so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of union station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from houston, boston and los angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, olowski says. that's not the federalist society's job. the federalist society's job is to put these ideas out there. and of course, as james madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.
it's not like a draft, or a paper that fell out of the photocopier and coincidentally came to us, mahdi told the iraqi cabinet in comments on state television.
at least 65 protests focused on daca. in la palma, calif., protesters demanded a clean dreamers act; others staged a die-in. almost 50 protests focused on net neutrality, many taking place outside verizon stores in places like bennington, vt.; boise, idaho; and boston.
what a democratic senate would mean: while democratic priorities on issues like voting rights and immigration, as well as contentious proposals to expand the courts, would likely be off the table without gop support, much of biden's agenda could pass via the same budget reconciliation procedure senate republicans used under trump, which only requires a bare majority, nbc news's benjy sarlin writes.
in an interview later tuesday with sky news, corbyn suggested that any cap should be somewhat higher than 138,000 pounds a year ($168,000) — his own salary. i think, certainly, the salaries that are paid to some footballers are simply ridiculous, he said. i think some of the salaries paid to very high-earning top executives of companies are utterly ridiculous.
trump mixes up a lot of things here. the fiscal 2018 budget for the state department and foreign operations (including foreign aid) was $54 billion. the trump administration proposed cutting it to $42 billion in fiscal 2019. the senate appropriations committee, in a unanimous bipartisan vote, approved a budget of $54.4 billion. the republicans control the senate. so it was not just democrats, it was not $12 billion over $54 billion and it was not all money for foreign aid but also money — about $12 billion — to keep the state department running.

the environmental protection agency has finalized a rule to limit what research it can use to craft public health protections, a move opponents argue is aimed at crippling the agency's ability to more aggressively regulate the nation's air and water, juliet eilperin and brady dennis report. the 'strengthening transparency in regulatory science' rule, which the administration began pursuing early in trump's term, would require researchers to disclose the raw data involved in their public health studies before the agency could rely upon their conclusions. it will apply this new set of standards to 'dose-response studies,' which evaluate how much a person's exposure to a substance increases the risk of harm. … many of the nation's leading researchers and academic organizations, however, argue that the criteria will actually restrict the epa from using some of the most consequential research on human subjects because it often includes confidential medical records and other proprietary data that cannot be released due to privacy concerns.
investment in infrastructure, in particular, would be a huge boon to the u.s. economy. it's no secret that the country's roads, bridges and public transportation are crumbling, so that's an obvious place to start. but stopping there would be a mistake. infrastructure plays a crucial role in two of the country's biggest challenges: winning the fight against climate change and delivering economic prosperity to all americans.

the program is administered by the states, and the reasons for low participation rates vary. the child-care subsidy is not an entitlement. limited funding means the subsidies are not available to all eligible families. some families that meet federal guidelines do not meet stricter state requirements. others may not know about the subsidies, may find it difficult to apply for them, or may be wait listed because their state cannot afford to subsidize all eligible applicants, the gao said.

during the 2018 midterms, news for democracy helped create at least 14 facebook pages and purchased the ads that ran on them, according to a person familiar with its operations who was not authorized to speak on the record. while the ads, cached in facebook's public database, show that news for democracy paid for them, the pages themselves — which are listed as news companies — do not disclose their backers or offer any identifying information beyond their name.
ending pay-for-delay tactics is a priority for grassley, who has teamed up with sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) on their preserve access to affordable generics act. the legislation, which would prohibit the deals for generics, would inject a healthy dose of midwestern, common-sense medicine into big pharma, grassley said in a november floor speech.

a biden transition official said the incoming administration expects deese and adeyemo to recuse themselves from matters pertaining specifically to blackrock for an appropriate period determined by law and an ethics agreement that is still in development. still, their prominence within the top tier of biden's economic team, and blackrock's heavy investment in washington influence in recent years, puts the company in a unique position heading into a period when its business lines could be coming under close scrutiny.

also troubling carlson was the president's apparent position, at the meeting, that he'd sign on to a resolution of the predicament of the dreamers — about 700,000 people who came to the country illegally as children, and who were protected under president barack obama's deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program — without tethering the matter to broader immigration-reform measures. amnesty for daca recipients is the only leverage the white house has, ripped carlson. once the president agrees to let them jump to the head of the line, ahead of millions of other people hoping to come here legally, the negotiation is over. at that point, why would democrats agree to anything? ending chain migration, the diversity lottery, supporting a merit-based system that might actually help america? no chance. (on twitter, the president issued this walk-back).

the rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the cold war was twofold. the first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. so shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.

when you get to the manufacturing level, it's hard to prove that they knew what was happening, another law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. but they were making the product, they were selling it to the country's largest distributors, and they had a responsibility under the law to detect and report orders that were suspicious. these orders were beyond suspicious.

the epa directive also targeted federal grants to universities and nonprofit groups. although cameron did not identify the total amount of funding affected by the new policy, and the department declined to comment on the matter, interior officials said it involves hundreds of millions of dollars.
the republican party after president trump — and after an arguably criminal attempt to extort georgia's secretary of state to change the state's results (was he planning the same for other states so he could reach 270 electoral votes?) — cannot remain a viable party so long as it coddles politicians who refuse to accept the basic premise of democracy: elections matter because the people hold the power (in case some have forgotten). the party cannot embrace characters who bring bad-faith challenges to an election, thereby destroying our constitutional fabric, nor those who would excuse or overlook trump's appalling but failed election heist.
the taliban was excluded from international conferences and afghan gatherings from 2001 to 2003 that drew up a new government, even though some taliban figures had shown a willingness to join in. instead, the united states posted bounties for their capture and sent hundreds to the military prison at guantanamo bay, cuba.

consider the particulars of the current immigration talks and trump's response to them. in the white house, a bipartisan group of senators yesterday presented an agreement that would grant protected status to the dreamers who were brought here illegally as children, pump more money into border security, tweak family-based immigration and end the diversity visa lottery program, which distributes visas to countries with historically low immigration rates, many in africa and central asia, channeling those visas to some u.s. residents with temporary protected status (tps) from countries like el salvador, nicaragua and haiti, a program trump is rolling back.

perhaps counterintuitively, trump's impulsive attraction to transactional thinking may make him less likely to stumble into a war than more ideologically driven presidents. many wars have begun because politicians felt they couldn't lose face, shell said. trump relishes the unpredictability of his behavior. he would never say, 'my word is sacred to me, i have to pull the trigger.'

russia's election inference was one of the most divisive topics of the presidential campaign.
the emphasis, doctors say, should be on personal responsibility and empowerment. for an overwhelming problem like climate change, being able to take some action — whether eating less meat or switching to an electric vehicle — can help fight paralysis and get patients to recognize that the worst of climate change is not a fait accompli and that some progress can be made. haase says patients can often end up at one of two poles: one focused on catastrophe, the other essentially ignoring the problem. recognizing the middle space can open up your thoughts. by going back and forth, it creates a larger space for you to think in and feel in, she explains, and out of that come innovative solutions.

again, this was not a hard-and-fast policy proposal. if it becomes one, there's plenty more analysis to be done about the effects and plenty of debate over what percentage to apply at what income level.
their bids reflect the fact that once-conservative prince william has become a hub of liberal energy in virginia, political analysts say — allowing local democratic activist candi king to raise nearly four times as much as republican heather mitchell in tuesday's special election to fill the seat carroll foy vacated in december to focus on her gubernatorial bid.
one thing i've found is that tech companies have not been present in the debate around reimbursement or payment and delivery reform, mendelson said. if they put their muscle behind aligning the health-care system to make sure that tech is embraced in the health-care system, that would be very productive. it will happen when they decide it's of sufficient strategic importance.

she's a fantastic voice for free markets and for climate realism, said james taylor, director of the arthur b. robinson center for climate and environmental policy at the heartland institute, an influential libertarian think tank in suburban chicago that has the ear of the trump administration.
after a succession of quick military victories in 2001 and early 2002, bush decided to keep a light force of u.s. troops in afghanistan indefinitely to hunt suspected terrorists. soon, however, he made plans to invade another nation — iraq — and afghanistan quickly became an afterthought.

and the 20 pelosi-backing trump district democrats really fit into two camps. one camp come from places where trump performed more weakly than previous republican nominees: reps. tom o'halleran (ariz.), lucy mcbath (ga.), lauren underwood (ill.), haley stevens (mich.), angie craig (minn.), josh gottheimer (mass.) and kendra horn (okla.).

the news of the likely georgia results came just hours before senate republicans mounted their final major challenge to biden's victory, with many formally objecting to the electoral college certification of biden's win, an extraordinary move that turned a typically perfunctory ceremony into a fraught debate.
so it's tempting to think that companies are just doing this to cover their fannies in the event that someone takes them to court over a crash. a national safety council white paper on the topic notes that if employers can show that they implemented a total ban, educated employees about the policy, monitored their compliance and enforced the policy, they will be in a more defensible position should someone sue them.
the president certainly didn't invent racism, she replied. but he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.

some african americans also said they were motivated by the death from cancer of civil rights legend and longtime congressman john lewis, who had frequently been on the receiving end of president trump's attacks. ossoff once interned for lewis, who supported his campaign before he passed away, and he worked as a staffer for rep. hank johnson (d-ga.), another black congressman.

the orthodox conservative view's shortcoming is obvious. caring more about debt than people in need is a classic flaw that democrats have successfully exploited since the days of the great depression. working-class voters will always back a party that understands that they need government to give them a fair shot at earning what they deserve. that means support for legitimate union organizing, protection against unfair foreign competition via trade or illegal immigration, and entitlements such as social security and medicare that ensure they are not impoverished through what ronald reagan called unemployment by reason of old age.
the end came quickly, remember, for manning. one season, he could play. the next season, suddenly, he couldn't.
for instance, trump's extraordinarily promiscuous lying has lifted the journalistic taboo on saying a politician lied. the media may still use the term sparingly, but the presumption every other politician of any party is granted — that when they say something, they're telling the truth unless and until we have evidence otherwise — is no longer granted to the president. when he makes suspicious claims, reporters know they have to check them out, and will say forthrightly when they are false. not all the time, of course, but more often than they've done in the past.
for starters, a number of republicans have joined sens. tom cotton (r-ark.), susan collins (r-maine), mitt romney (r-utah) and lisa murkowski (r-alaska) in denouncing the attempted coup. sen. rob portman (r-ohio), in a written statement, declared that after two months of recounts and legal challenges, not a single state recount changed a result and, of the dozens of lawsuits filed, not one found evidence of fraud or irregularities widespread enough to change the result of the election. portman, therefore, concluded: over the course of my public service career, i have taken the same oath on numerous occasions, swearing to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution of the united states. i plan on honoring that oath by supporting the state certifications and the will of the people. i will vote to certify in accordance with my duty under the constitution. sen. mike lee (r-utah), one of the senate's most conservative members, will also decline to join the mob.
the alliance also noted that the bill was approved by both houses of congress and signed by obama.

but iraqi officials said the americans sent them the letter not once, but twice, because of an error in how it was initially translated. u.s. military officials confirmed the letter was genuine, and one said that a version sent to iraqi officials was signed.
in his lessons learned interview, richards recalled having a tense encounter with rumsfeld in 2006. the pentagon chief asked the nato commander why things were deteriorating in the south. richards replied that it was because he did not have enough resources: and rummy said 'general what do you mean?' i said, 'we don't have enough troops and resources and we've raised expectations.' he said 'general, i don't agree. move on.'  david richards | lessons learned interview | 9/27/2017tap to view full document

miller: well, i think that it's been an important reminder to all americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become, in many cases, a supreme branch of government. one unelected judge in seattle cannot remake laws for the entire country. i mean this is just crazy, john, the idea that you have a judge in seattle say that a foreign national living in libya has an effective right to enter the united states is -- is -- is beyond anything we've ever seen before.
it also meant i was eating later. i work on books in addition to my editing job at the paper, so i wouldn't start cooking until 7 p.m. and often finished after 10. that became dinnertime. i put my 12-hour rule on hiatus, convinced that this was short-term and that i'd be fine in a month or two.

president trump similarly needled biden over the green new deal during the presidential election, despite the democratic candidate's rejection of the plan.
instead, the meeting of deputy-level negotiators will give each side a chance to take stock and serve as a litmus test for whether a deal can be achieved before march 1, when trump has threatened to impose another round of tariffs and to raise duties on imports to 25% from 10%. 'next week's negotiations are important because they will establish expectations,' said myron brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the us chamber of commerce. 'however, we shouldn't expect major breakthroughs next week.'
decker said that it was inauthentic and misleading for a left-leaning political operative to try to create communities of conservatives for the express purpose of sending those people political messages that would sway their thinking — and to use the label of a news organization to do so. calling yourself a media organization creates some kind of degree of trust and authority, he said. it's harmful to the health of the digital public square, and should not have a place on facebook.
sometimes the president claims that trump ballots were dumped in a river. white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany previously explained that this claim was a reference to an investigation in wisconsin. some lost mail in wisconsin was found on the side of a road and in a ditch line in greenville, a small town of about 12,000 people outside the city of appleton. the mail was supposed to be in transit to the post office, according to the outagamie county sheriff's office. several absentee ballots were found among three trays of mail, according to the sheriff's office. wisconsin elections commission administrator meagan wolfe announced that she'd been informed by post office officials that no wisconsin ballots were among the lost mail.
the dea also discovered that sunrise, over an 11-month period, had sent at least 92,400 tablets to schultz, the delray beach doctor who prescribed the pills found in tennessee. in one day, he had prescribed 1,000 tablets to one patient.
michael shellenberger, an author and founder of the california-based nonprofit environmental progress, which promotes nuclear energy, remembers how panicked he felt after watching the movie. now, he considers it bizarre that adults would have decided to traumatize teenagers with that. today, he says, some in the environmental movement are making climate change the new apocalypse.

transportation secretary elaine chao delivers a speech at ces in las vegas on wednesday.
perhaps the biggest change of the trump era is the approach of republican leaders. in the past, they indulged these theories but never really espoused them. today, elective officeholders embrace them openly, in the face of explicit counterevidence from the government they purport to run. national security officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that ukraine did not meddle in the 2016 election and that those who repeat the claim are advancing pro-russian propaganda. yet most republican members of congress now seem to believe this theory, pointing to a thin report in politico that documented no top-down, coordinated interference. trump's racism (calling mexican immigrants rapists; telling four congresswomen of color who are all u.s. citizens to go back to their crime infested home countries) and anti-semitism (he implies jews are loyal primarily to israel and motivated mostly by money) align well with old allegations that jewish bankers and assorted globalists have enriched themselves while inflicting economic havoc on the people, as his closing 2016 television ad suggested.
when you get to that level of volume being pumped through, some of the pipes start to freeze up. you start running out of oxygen tanks that patients need to be sent home and discharged, kim-farley said. as the cases keep increasing, you're going to see those kinds of effects start to pile up. icu beds get full. the er gets backed up. ambulances have nowhere to take patients. you get severe, chronic staffing shortages. elective surgeries get canceled again. the ability to care simply degrades.

warnock's identity as a black preacher has become central to his bid to reach the higher ground of the u.s. senate. republicans, who tend to perceive less conflict in the relationship between god and country, have cast him as a dangerous departure from the norm. in a recent debate, a conspicuously scripted sen. kelly loeffler, the republican incumbent whom warnock is trying to unseat, called him a radical liberal more than a dozen times. a pro-loeffler attack ad features a video clip of warnock warning members of his congregation that they cannot serve god and money, or god and the military, at the same time (matthew 6:24). the ad is spliced with snippets of warnock yelling during sermons. over action-movie-trailer music and lo-fi lighting, a grim-sounding narrator explains the threat warnock poses to the republic: raphael warnock attacks our soldiers. warnock attacks our police. . . . raphael warnock is radical and dangerous.

staying put is not an uncommon practice of late. major corporations called off large gatherings, and hotel chains reported rising cancellations. some travel agents report that clients are canceling cruise plans abroad and changing to u.s.-based sailings or all-inclusive resorts. airlines including american, jetblue and alaska waived change and cancellation fees for new bookings in case customers get nervous about traveling.
and ephemeral messaging is only becoming more prevalent in the run-up to the 2020 campaign: sen. elizabeth warren, for instance, cracked open a beer in her instagram story last week after announcing her presidential bid. former texas rep. beto o'rourke, who's weighing a 2020 run, was a frequent instagram stories user during his 2018 campaign for senator, showing personal moments even after he lost of himself eating guacamole while driving.
scott j. cameron, interior's principal deputy assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, instructed other assistant secretaries and bureau and office heads to submit most grants and cooperative agreements for approval by one of his aides. those include any award of at least $50,000 to a non-profit organization that can legally engage in advocacy or to an institution of higher education.
here's my role in the situation: the event was on wednesday, feb. 1, and late thursday evening, a student emailed me to let me know about the incident. i was very troubled by this and corresponded with the ayn rand institute people to get more facts; late friday evening, i emailed the law school's vice-dean about this. (i chose the vice-dean partly because he is the faculty administrator who seemed likely to have some authority over this, and partly because he's a good friend of mine and i trust his good faith and judgment.) the vice-dean was traveling but said he'd look into this, which is what he did during the week.
greitens has received mixed reviews in as governor. while campaigning on a platform of cleaning up government, he admitted to the missouri ethics commission that he had violated campaign finance law, according to the kansas city star. he was fined $1,000. he and his senior staff have also come under fire for using an app that deletes text messages after they've been read, raising concerns about trying to subvert missouri open records law.
there are sound policy reasons for ignoring campaign statements or promises to shed light on subsequent official action. for one, campaign promises are often insincere, designed to appeal to voters. indeed, they are explicitly instrumental, and their goal is not policy outputs, but election. moreover, implemented laws or policies are often substantially different from promises, as is the case here.

but the party is not behaving the way it did in 2016. by this point in the previous cycle, 63 democratic members of congress had already endorsed clinton, who was months away from announcing her campaign. as of right now, no democratic member of congress has endorsed a potential presidential candidate. the idea of candidates jumping in to prevent a rallying effect for someone else is, for now, defunct, and the results in 2016 (such as sanders's landslide win in new hampshire) cut against the idea that endorsements from prominent democrats can move votes.

the investigation into helgen's trip was first reported by writer michael balter in the verge in august. staffers had alleged that, during the 2015 trip to kenya, helgen attempted to take specimens out of the country without a proper permit. an initial inquiry by the smithsonian's inspector general found evidence of confusion about the handling of specimens but concluded that no laws or smithsonian rules had been broken. then the museum opened its own investigation, which went on for 10 months. based on interviews with helgen's co-leaders on the kenya trip, the verge alleged that the inquiry ignored evidence that could have exonerated helgen.

what remains unclear in the abstract is why trump wants a second term in office anyway. he enjoys the trappings of the job, sure, and the power. but he never bothered actually articulating a platform of policy goals during the 2020 election, even when pressed by friendly reporters to do so. that he has the position now and isn't actually doing anything with it lends credence to the idea that his motivations for trying to overturn his loss are rooted more in his own vanity and possible legal concerns than much else.

donald trump, like obama, campaigned on a pledge to get the united states out of the nation-building business. but when iraqi leaders demanded that u.s. forces withdraw after trump ordered the killing in iraq of a top iranian military commander, the president's instinct was to describe the crisis in purely mercenary terms: we've spent a lot of money in iraq, he said. we have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. it cost billions of dollars to build. . . . we're not leaving unless they pay us back for it.

but more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the federalists have achieved. this position might be summed up as: if you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. a number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. as this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in supreme court dissents. advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.

the homeowners group's opposition to morning prayers wasn't its first objection, said sultan chaudhry, mic's president. the community organization's president, paul overberg, has raised repeated concerns about mic since it moved in in 2015, chaudhry said. overberg's complaints have prompted mic's members to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on traffic and noise-mitigation studies, lawyers' fees, and landscape improvements. he's opposed us every step of the way, chaudhry said.
in the republican-controlled house … the differences between democrats and republicans are even greater. house speaker paul ryan has far more hardline immigration hawks in his conference. democratic house leader nancy pelosi, meanwhile, has far more members who are opposed to any kind of deal that set back the parents of daca recipients either by limiting chain migration or other mechanisms.
davos organizers, however, say they're ready to welcome trump. according to politico, forum organizers lobbied the administration for months to send high-level officials. no president has attended the forum since 2000.
american views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. but the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby white house and which party leads congress.
per our discussion with rep. burgess on saturday, his office called me this afternoon before the hearing and asked me for questions he could ask dea, berkey wrote in the email disclosed in an unsealed deposition.
ensuring uninterrupted television programming for customers is vital to tv providers, in part because of high-profile live sports events that occur in january. for instance, in washington, customers may miss out on the nfl playoffs, part of which will be broadcast on cbs this weekend. tv viewers can still tune into broadcast signals without their fios-provided video subscription, but that typically requires separate equipment such as a digital broadcast antenna, or signing up for new streaming video apps and services.
yet, simonds's path is not without risks, kidd said. if she seeks a second recount, she may signal to voters that she's a loser who didn't want to accept it, he said.
the argument for the latter is evident. trump's top critics in the senate gop — jeff flake (ariz.), bob corker (tenn.), ben sasse (neb.) and, for a time, lindsey o. graham (s.c.) — talked a big game but did little to impact trump's actions. the first two opted for retirement, with flake waving a white flag in the face of trumpism and really only using his legislative prerogatives toward the end of his tenure. graham, once critical, is now a top trump ally who occasionally criticizes his foreign policy. all have regularly voted with the president's priorities.
one program broadly falls in line with a school of thinking that goes back at least as far as the 18th century enlightenment philosopher immanuel kant, and holds that we should always treat people as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. in common parlance, this is similar to the biblical golden rule — do unto others what we would want done to ourselves. under this approach, we should first vaccinate those who are most at risk from the virus. this means giving priority to the elderly and those in care homes, and then steadily spreading vaccinations to younger age groups. this is happening in the u.k. and germany.
like much else in the massive spending bill, the tpsa began as an independent piece of legislation but was added into the stimulus package after languishing on capitol hill because of the reduced legislative schedule caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
but the dna answer was quickly sent to reporters by america rising, a republican opposition research group that has spent years tracking and researching warren. rep. steve king (r-iowa), who represents sioux city and narrowly won reelection amid controversy over his praise for white-nationalist politicians, responded to warren hours later with a tweet pointing out that she would be traveling through pocahontas, sac & cherokee counties.

newell said one of the biggest challenges his company has faced is getting the brand recognition so that people realize the app is a central place for health information. to increase people's engagement, castlight has tied its app deeply into health plans and the person's specific benefits, giving people financial rewards for good health behavior. members who receive cash bonuses for taking a certain number of steps or inputting blood glucose measurements a few times a week if they have diabetes can get a discount on their premium — while managing their disease better. at the same time, they become more familiar with the app.

after the sioux city event, i asked warren if there was a reason she wasn't mentioning medicare-for-all in the stump speech. no, no special reason, she said. no one's raised it. but i have had a chance to talk about medicaid. partly because i think we've had a national conversation about health care, and i think it's been enormously valuable. it's obviously about how we protect ourselves and each other. but it's also about our values. i hope we continue to have that conversation. i will continue to talk about health care every chance i get.

the only dogmas they recognize anymore are the impulses and lies of a president who stands on no discernible principle beyond self-interest.
about a dozen states take a similar approach, according to a review of draft plans by the prison policy initiative, a massachusetts think tank. several states, including new jersey and washington, have already begun vaccinating inmates. another seven — connecticut, delaware, maryland, massachusetts, nebraska, new mexico and pennsylvania — put incarcerated people after health-care workers and the residents and staff of long-term care facilities, according to the think tank.

the shutdown has lasted 13 days without any signs of compromise or earnest negotiations, with democrats largely unifying and a number of republicans flummoxed over trump's strategy.
iowans cited a slew of reasons for their eagerness to begin the lengthy nomination process to settle on a leader to go up against president trump. there were the tax cuts that one voter called a waste of time and money; the trade war with china depressing demand for exports and hurting farmers; the hostility toward immigrants, a labor pool heavily used on iowa farms; the rolling back of environmental regulations that impact iowa's rivers; a foreign policy approach changing the country's status in the world; and the general chaos and lack of civility in the white house.
if a miner does manage to get clean, he still has to work every day with pain. it is a dire situation based on economic dependency, and sadly, it has spread far beyond the mining industry and deep into our local communities.
by accepting the use of preelection statements to impeach and limit executive policy, the 9th circuit is taking a dangerous step. the states' argument is in essence that trump is a bigot, and thus his winning presidential campaign in fact impeaches him from exercising key constitutional and statutory powers, such as administering the immigration laws.

smart luggage performs more than beast-of-burden duties. depending on the model, the brainy bag might come with usb ports for charging gadgets, gps tracking, electronic locks and built-in digital scales. one company called modobag allows travelers to zoom around on their luggage like a scooter, which tops out at 8 mph. many manufacturers, such as away, barracuda, g-ro, raden, arlo skye, travelpro and heys (the only maker to use aaa batteries), sell smart luggage that complies with the new rule. the ones that do not are rethinking their designs.
before the encounter, passengers had sat on the tarmac for about two hours. the crew, a passenger said, had told them they were having difficulty closing the latch on the plane's luggage compartment. the airline said the weather conditions were so bad — just after the bomb cyclone had battered the northeast with snow, ice and frigid cold — that one of the aircraft's doors froze and could not be fixed in time before the crew exhausted its regulated duty day limits.
epa administrator andrew wheeler — a former lobbyist for the coal, chemical and uranium industries — will announce the final rule at a virtual session hosted today by the competitive enterprise institute. that think tank disputes the idea that climate change poses a major threat. although biden will probably seek to overturn this, such an effort will take months, if not longer.

this is not an attitude he developed when he entered politics. in 1980, trump gave one of his most revealing interviews, to tv celebrity interviewer rona barrett, saying that winning transactions was the core of his life: i think about it literally 24 hours a day, and i really enjoy it. . . . i do understand it's all basically a game. . . . the people that enjoy it are the people that have been winners. trump views existence as a battle to make the best deals. i really look at life to a certain extent as combat, he said at the time. his first bestseller described dealmaking as his art.
attendance and graduation records that were documented in the investigation commissioned by the office of the state superintendent of education were damning, and clearly demonstrated that district policy was not followed: about 35 percent of ballou's 2017 graduates missed most of the school year. d.c. schools policy dictates that students should fail a class if they are absent 30 times.
in its absence, the hoarding and anti-social behavior witnessed last spring is now showing itself in hideously selfish antics over the vaccine. people are jumping queues and impersonating others, while interest groups are involved in an unsightly attempt to lobby congress for their people to get the shot first. when stanford medical school attempted to organize distribution using an algorithm, they faced an insurrection from staff chanting, the algorithm sucks!

arizona, once heralded for turning the corner after a summer surge, now has 69 of every 100,000 residents hospitalized with the virus — the highest rate in the country. hospital leaders say they saw this coming a month ago, but they allege that gov. doug ducey (r) ignored their pleas to reimpose measures to curb the spread. state officials have said enacting restrictions would do little to curb transmission at private gatherings.
as always, there are questions: are the vaccines safe? will they have side effects? will the difficult task of transporting and delivering them be accomplished? and most important, will enough americans be willing to take them?
the converging church-state debates involve separate, yet connected issues with overlapping arguments that span the government. they are definitely related in the sense it's part of the administration's effort to expand religious exemptions and to license discrimination based on religion, said lindsey kaley, an attorney with the american civil liberties union's center for liberty.

russia used to be the soviet union. afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan, russia. so you take a look at other countries, pakistan is there. they should be fighting but russia should be fighting. the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia, they were right to be there. the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt. they went into being called russia again as opposed to the soviet union.

tensions have grown between rome and the u.s. church after a year of abuse-related scandals. when the pope was accused by a former diplomat of knowing about some of the alleged abuses of former cardinal theodore mccarrick, a handful of u.s. higher-ups said the accusations were credible. subsequently, francis did not green-light an investigation into mccarrick requested by the head of the u.s. bishops conference, houston's cardinal daniel dinardo. and the vatican intervened to halt the u.s. bishops at their annual meeting in november from voting on new measures for handling abuse-related complaints.
tarullo has warned against forgetting about the lessons of the great recession. there may be refinements that could be made to financial regulations, he said at a conference in december. but i do not think there is a sound economic case for generally weakening the regulatory requirements applicable to the largest banks. and i certainly do not think the taxpayers should bear the risk that would be entailed by any such weakening, he said.

georgia election officials say trump's voter fraud claims have shaken voter confidence.
we were able to respond to his questions about 85 percent of the time, inman said. that was because the iranians and algerians were using crypto devices.
trump agreed to take pictures with manchin that were used in the senator's 2018 campaign, and the president has called him out of the blue just to talk politics while repeatedly asking him to become a republican. people close to the president said he has more affection for manchin than any other senate democrat, and that he understands the transactional nature of the relationship.
the senator said he had not slept past 4 a.m. since the senate impeachment trial began last month, wrestling over how he should vote, and eventually decided to buck the president because he saw the evidence that trump pressured the leader of ukraine to investigate his political rivals as overwhelming.
1. say mike montanan sues carl canadian for some tort. maybe mike and carl had a business dispute, and mike gets a $1 million verdict against carl for fraud. mike gets that verdict in canadian court, because that's where carl lives, and where the dispute took place. so far, no problem; these sorts of transnational lawsuits are pretty common.
it was a thoroughly uncontroversial remark for a modern conservative politician to make — the kind that makes it easy to forget how unpopular king was when he was alive. gallup polling estimated that americans felt more negatively toward him as the 1960s progressed. critics branded king a radical communist hellbent on destroying america, and those accusations continued well after he was killed; president ronald reagan initially opposed the proposal to make king's birthday a national holiday, and more than 100 lawmakers in the house and senate voted against it. in a 1983 debate on the matter, sen. jesse helms (r-n.c.) accused king of harboring radical political views rooted in marxist communism.
that's the second half of amazement. the long lens on sarkisian's comeback yields something richly impressive, coursing twice through nick saban's alabama, that portal for the wayward. the trajectory went all the way to the broyles award this season as the top assistant coach in the land, coordinating alabama's otherworldly offense, the receivers darting about with unparalleled skill and geometric beauty.
anna rose riccard, 25, works for antiabortion organizations and called the president's appearance not a boon but an unfortunate distraction. riccard, of alexandria, said she doesn't believe the antiabortion cause is a priority for trump, and she saw fellow catholics disagreeing on social media about his appearance.
take the eloquent statement from sen. mitt romney (r-utah): the egregious ploy to reject electors may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our democratic republic. . . . the justice department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election. pointing to the most egregious self-promoter and disingenuous member of the senate (for which the competition is stiff), romney says, my fellow senator ted cruz and the co-signers of his statement argue that rejection of electors or an election audit directed by congress would restore trust in the election. nonsense. . . . this has the predictable potential to lead to disruption, and worse. he concludes, i could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. has ambition so eclipsed principle? (he is new around there, isn't he?)

in many ways, trump's approach to the presidency adds to the uncertainty of an increasingly volatile situation in the middle east, with the administration deploying thousands of additional troops to the region even as iran vows to take revenge with attacks on unspecified american targets.
republicans, ex-republicans and independents should not give up these principles simply because the gop has abandoned them and become enamored of statism, authoritarianism, xenophobia and russian toadyism — impulses inimical to anyone who had a passing familiarity with the sort of conservatism practiced by ronald reagan and george h.w. bush, the late senator john mccain (r-ariz.) and govs. larry hogan of maryland, john kasich of ohio and charlie baker of massachusetts. that half of the people on that list passed away and one is leaving office tells you how lacking we are in decent center-right leadership.

but as the impeachment trial began in the senate during trump's long day of activity here, the president repeatedly pivoted away from his broader economic message to lash out against his domestic political foes and the effort to remove him from office.
the group smiled and nodded. crowley had pushed legislation mandating that immigrations and customs officers file a report every time they stop someone, rather than every time they make an arrest. ocasio-cortez's push to abolish the immigration and customs enforcement agency altogether seemed more resonant and radical.

based on uniform intelligence assessments, the russians were responsible for hacking the dnc. the first test came in late december 2016. barack obama was still president. with just weeks to go until trump's inauguration, the obama administration announced it was imposing sanctions on russia in response to its interference in the campaign.

this last race of a turbulent cycle – which will decide which party takes the senate majority – is their final test to ensure voters can cast ballots securely and have confidence in the election results. that task, even after the 2020 presidential election was deemed by government and election officials to be the most secure in history, is complicated as trump and his allies continue to peddle debunked fraud claims and pressure georgia officials to recalculate the presidential vote in his favor.

when we got ballots in from the military with trump all over it and they got thrown into a river, you saw that. they threw ballots into a river from the military with my name all over it. we want trump, boom, goes into the river.
look at it differently: this is the perfect time for concerned republicans (and certainly ones with presidential aspirations) to shed the party's trumpian yoke. they can finally say they broke with trump (albeit days before he leaves office). as a bonus, they can jettison some of the most obnoxious and ignorant members of congress. the egregious nature of these members' offense creates the perfect bright-line test for membership in one of the two national parties: patriots on one side, seditionists on the other. the non-seditious part of the gop will never have a better shot at washing off the stink of the trump era than it does right now.
oof: top health advisers are pushing back against trump's claim the coronavirus death toll is exaggerated.
legal scholars disagree about whether the national labor relations act requires employers to recognize minority unions, said catherine fisk, a law professor at the university of california at berkeley. but this model of organizing was standard practice in the united states in the 1930s, before companies found a strategic advantage shifting norms toward unions certified by the nlrb election process.
although the 1970 law is not well known outside certain legal and policy circles, nepa compels agencies to analyze thousands of projects across the country each year. these can range from a mining company applying for a permit to drain a wetland to an energy company seeking federal approval to conduct seismic testing offshore or to lay down ice roads to hunt for oil.

days later, trump and flynn had a one-on-one conversation in the oval office. the president was upset about the stories and asked his national security adviser what he told the russian ambassador. flynn acknowledged to trump that he might have discussed sanctions with kislyak.
some counties and hospital systems launched reservation websites, only for them to quickly become booked or crash. others announced appointments only through facebook, with slots filling before some residents knew to look. and many have not revealed how the vaccine will be made available to anyone beyond health-care workers and long-term care residents and employees, the focus of the first round of vaccinations.
i think right now what we're seeing is there is more transmission in certain parts of the world, and so it's important to keep an eye on where the transmission is being reported, said crystal watson, an assistant professor at the johns hopkins center for health security. right now those places might not be the best places to go if you can avoid traveling there. but i think soon we're going to see a lot more transmission around the world.

grenell has no lengthy intelligence experience. his history of pro-trump tweets and his personal relationships with trump's children have caused current and former officials to doubt whether he could credibly serve as the country's top intelligence official, which they said maguire did, despite having spent his career in the military.

but it's not clear that roeper, who appeared for years on a syndicated movie-criticism program with fellow critic roger ebert, did anything more than stroke his own ego by packing his follower count (currently 224,000) with an undisclosed number of phantoms and phonies purchased from devumi. the times reported that it was able to buy 25,000 followers from devumi for $225.
when he learned he was removed from ohio's rolls, nobody really cared about the issue, he told the post. years later, after putting the issue behind him, he stumbled across a facebook post about the supreme court case and left a comment about what he went through. the left-leaning interest group progress ohio took notice, as did the aclu, he said. soon after, the calls started coming in from news organizations and advocacy groups.

this system had serious shortcomings. when party members could not find or agree upon someone who commanded widespread respect within the majority party, the house struggled to pass legislation on important policy priorities. for example, mccormack failed to pass most of the kennedy legislative program in the 87th congress, between 1961 and 1963, despite a large democratic majority.

-- among the policy decisions still to be made is what to do about the tens of thousands of syrian kurdish fighters that u.s. forces have trained, armed and advised to carry out the ground war against the islamic state, karen deyoung and karoun demirjian report. while trump has expressed confidence that turkey, which controls its own syrian force opposed to both the kurds and to president bashar al-assad, is capable of picking up the remaining fight against the islamic state, pentagon and state department officials question turkish priorities and capabilities. … bolton and secretary of state mike pompeo have stated repeatedly in recent months that driving iran from syria was also an objective for both the united states and israel. but trump appeared to indicate sunday that both iran and russia, whose forces in syria back assad, were potential u.s. allies against the islamic state.
the legislative action is far from complete — the bill must be voted on by the full senate and then survive scrutiny in the house as well — but sen. scott a. surovell (d-fairfax) said that he and several of his colleagues believe the city has the financial capacity to fix these problems, but it's dragging its feet.

the first problem here is that ocasio-cortez is really minimizing her falsehoods. four pinocchios is not a claim that glenn kessler and the post's fact checker team give out for bungling the semantics of something. it's when something is a blatant falsehood. it's the worst rating you can get for a singular claim.
the new law makes it virtually impossible for the dea to freeze suspicious narcotic shipments from the companies, according to internal agency and justice department documents and an independent assessment by the dea's chief administrative law judge in a soon-to-be-published law review article. that powerful tool had allowed the agency to immediately prevent drugs from reaching the street.
the media blitz coincided with yet another campaign to promote gorsuch's nomination, by judicial crisis network. jcn announced that it would spend $10 million, calling it the most robust operation in the history of confirmation battles. crc, its media consultant on the campaign, later boasted that online videos, television ads, pundit commentary, opinion essays and other material supporting gorsuch had been viewed 1.2 billion times.
that july poll from quinnipiac also got to ocasio-cortez's first point about the dog whistles of white supremacy. in that same poll in which americans were split on trump's racial views, a clear majority believed that his presidency and rhetoric had given oxygen to racists.
one of her most important opinions as a circuit court judge was an against-the-grain dissent that said felons should not necessarily be forbidden from gun ownership. such a deprivation of second amendment rights should depend on whether a person is dangerous, she wrote, not the classification of his crime. the firearms policy coalition has filed a petition on behalf of a pennsylvania man similarly barred from gun ownership, which could provide the chance for the court's new conservative majority to consider the issue anew.

if these are your operating principles, and if you believe the other side will irrevocably alter them, then holding onto power isn't negotiable. denial isn't so much a political decision as a religious conviction. or, as one political soothsayer recently said to me: when politics becomes your religion, people become irrational.

some of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially amy coney barrett, named by trump to the 7th circuit. more than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling democratic sen. dianne feinstein's gaffe of telling the catholic barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. the lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of barrett moderating the panel. judge, welcome back to washington — and i hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, kannon shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at williams & connolly, said to barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.
may 26, 2019, issue: when a city is inundated with visitors, like washington in the summer, it can feel transformed by the tourists' gaze. trying to capture a foreign space often means we voraciously consume it faster than we digest it, and only engage with the most superficial part of its identity. still, it's easy to forget that where you're fortunate to live and work is the same place where others plan to spend their vacations.
i certainly do not contend that foot voting can solve all our problems, or that ballot box voting has no useful role. to the contrary, i have argued that foot voting cannot effectively address such issues as overexploitation of immobile assets by subnational governments, most notably property rights in land. for that reason, a system of decentralized foot voting needs to be supplemented with constitutional protections for property rights, for other immobile assets, and for people with unusually high moving costs. also, i recognize that there are some problems so large that they cannot realistically be dealt with at the regional or local level, and therefore must be addressed by national or even international ballot box voting.

attributing statements to trump did not affect public attitudes any more than attributing them to the fictional republican. opposition to the npt was essentially identical regardless of whether participants read about trump or evans supporting nuclear proliferation. public opposition to the iran deal was actually 5 percent higher when we attributed trump's rhetoric to evans. and public support for the first use of nuclear weapons was 6 percent higher when we attributed trump's rhetoric to evans. but these differences were small and likely due to chance variation.
texas athletic director chris del conte, jan. 2: decisions like this are very, very difficult and certainly not something i take lightly. as i've said before, my philosophy is to wait until the end of the season to look at all the factors in evaluating any of our programs. after much deliberation and a great deal of thought, as i looked back at the totality of where our football program is and in discussing its future, it became apparent that it was in the best interest of the university of texas to move in a different direction.

thanos, the villain (and protagonist, really) of the $2 billion-grossing megahit, avengers: infinity war, was basically an omni-powered paul ehrlich. whereas the comic book version of thanos sought to kill half of the universe in order to prove his love for an anthropomorphized death, the film version was driven insane by his home planet's self-immolation after a series of resource wars. determined to eliminate suffering over food and land, over clean water and clean air, thanos used the infinity gauntlet not to create abundance of each but to kill half of all living things.

but the fact that warnock has pastoral responsibilities puts him in an unusual strategic position — not just with voters who want to walk a righteous path, but also with respect to the radical liberal attack line from republicans. in december, the new york times reported that a different group of religious leaders wrote an open letter to loeffler, asking her to stop calling warnock a radical, saying that doing so amounted to a broader attack against the black church and faith traditions for which we stand. the pastor's social justice theological and faith traditions, they reportedly wrote, are not only accepted as an authentic prophetic message in the tradition of dr. martin luther king, but also a central message of the gospel of jesus christ.

many republican candidates recognized the value of appealing to the fervent base of tea party supporters and did so overtly. the movement introduced candidates of its own, often pulled from the mistier fringes of conservative thought. the establishment pushed back hard, working to undercut primary challenges from tea-party-spawned candidates. sometimes it worked; often it didn't. the energy among republican voters for candidates espousing hard-line tea party positions propelled several to surprising primary wins — but then to general-election losses, as the establishment had feared.

republicans control congress but democrats hold significant leverage over spending talks. in the house, hard-liners on the right have regularly voted against recent spending bills, requiring gop leaders to rely on at least some democratic votes to pass. in the senate, spending bills require at least 60 votes to avoid procedural hurdles, and republicans only hold 51 seats.

'president trump is a lot of things, but he's not hitler. he didn't kill millions of people. he didn't star a world war. he doesn't have any concentration camps,' crenshaw said.
in 2016 and 2017, the three nonprofits raised about $33 million, with the bh fund taking in $24,250,000 from a single donor whose identity is still not publicly known, documents show. bh fund then gave a total of almost $3 million to the two other leo groups, freedom and opportunity fund and america engaged. the center for responsive politics published details about the groups' spending in february.
one option under consideration includes clarifying the title vi regulation to make its use consistent with the trump administration's legal views. another option would replace the regulation with a new one, which would require a formal and lengthy process of public notice and comment.
from a purely partisan perspective, republican presidential candidates have won the national popular vote only once in the last 32 years, roy wrote in his statement. they have therefore depended on the electoral college for nearly all presidential victories in the last generation. if we perpetuate the notion that congress may disregard certified electoral votes — based solely on its own assessment that one or more states mishandled the presidential election — we will be delegitimizing the very system that led donald trump to victory in 2016, and that could provide the only path to victory in 2024.
at times, he said, some of his colleagues appeared more concerned with pleasing the industry than working on behalf of the public. some of the lawyers had simply given up fighting the industry and seemed to be preparing for a future working with the companies they were supposed to be regulating, he said.
4. how much damage has been done?
tlaib, one of the first muslim women elected to congress, ran as an implacable opponent of the president who had once been hauled out of an event for protesting him. her district, which for a half-century was represented by john conyers, gave trump just 18.1 percent of the vote. for tlaib herself, the political impact of saying that she wants the president impeached and removed from office was at worst a wash; at best, it's going to earn her votes.

sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) may soon be demoted from majority leader to minority leader because of the post-election donnybrook caused by trump. his former campaign manager and chief of staff josh holmes, who remains a top adviser, said the party's messaging in georgia repulsed the suburbanites who reliably voted republican in the pre-trump era:
that was august. this month, the education department said it corrected a coding error in the scorecard that undercounted people who did not pay down the balance on their undergraduate student loans. as a result, the repayment rates for most colleges and universities were inflated.

july 19, 2020, issue: after centuries of inequity, violence and hate, we have a renewed chance to rebuild america. we all need to work to dismantle what has been so deeply ingrained in our country and our minds. it's time to reevaluate and re-create an america with stronger ideals and a safer infrastructure for everyone. the only way we can do this is by actively working together — every day.
coronavirus testing kits have not been widely distributed to our hospitals and public health labs. those without these kits must send samples all the way to atlanta, rather than testing them on site, wasting precious time as the virus spreads, said senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.).
their former neighbors, tammy cooper and her husband david, have wrestled with the same emotions. what did this crisis do? it woke me up to what the government is and is not doing on many levels, she said.
what's more troubling is how these accusations and counter-accusations of foreign collusion brought the founders dangerously close to criminalizing political dissent. in 1798, federalists criminalized slander against the president — federalist john adams at the time — on the pretext that democratic-republican printers would embolden america's enemies in france. democratic-republicans responded in kind when they gained power. the henry-madison episode was only one instance in a longer history of accusing political opponents of foreign collusion and criminality.
the united nations has found that international operations, mostly airstrikes, killed 406 civilians in afghanistan in 2018. estimates by airwars, the bureau of investigative journalism and new america found that at least 13 civilians probably died in u.s. attacks in libya, somalia and yemen, bringing the minimum for the entire set of countries to 1,224, far above the pentagon figure.
none of this is to say that sanders isn't jewish enough, a noxious idea floating around far-right jewish circles. his jewish identity, rooted in the evil of the holocaust and the murder of his father's family by the nazis, chimes with that of many american jews, and i believe him when he says he is proud to be jewish.
these were the dark ages of american cryptology,  according to the cia history. the soviets, chinese and north koreans were using code-making systems that were all but impenetrable. u.s. spy agencies worried that the rest of the world would also go dark if countries could buy secure machines from hagelin.
march 8, 2020, issue: the era of peak tv has given us so many great shows, but it's almost too easy to live vicariously through them all. i'm trying to remind myself that i want to be more social and see my friends and family, live a real life, and feel my own emotions.
by 1995, enrollment had plummeted to about 80,000 students when the d.c. school reform act was passed by congress, paving the way for charter schools to open in the district.
but this is largely missing the forest for the trees. the story of the republican party for at least the past 12 years has been one of tension between a political establishment and a wild fringe. that tension has repeatedly spurred the establishment to try to appease or co-opt the fringe. but instead of folding into the party, the fringe keeps moving further out. that is the tension of the moment: how will a fringe empowered and reinforced by the trump presidency coexist with a republican party eager to move back toward reality?
foreign policy, too, could be a strong point for biden among disaffected republicans. in the fall, trump's foreign policy was finally losing republican support. that may rebound, temporarily, in the wake of the u.s. drone strike on iranian maj. gen. qasem soleimani in iraq, but the past several days have made clearer than ever that there is no trump foreign policy doctrine. there is, as ever, merely the cult of trump.
these four principles used to be assumed as central to modern conservatism. now they are under assault from self-labeled guardians of the right. while many aspects of gop policy of the past few decades (especially outright hostility to government) aren't worth saving, these four clearly are, for they nurture a free and diverse citizenry, promote innovation and social mobility, and adhere to the vision set out in our founding documents.

inside wells fargo, managers say they intend to build a more commensurate presence on wall street, where the firm ranks a mere ninth in capital markets and deal advisory, by focusing on business lines and industries where it already has credibility. that would translate, for example, to providing more underwriting and merger advice to corporate clients, but also lending to hedge funds looking to ramp up bets.
what if alexa said, 'you haven't had your mammogram this year.' what if you said, 'i've got a sore throat; what are my options?'  oza said, describing a possible vision of the future. it's something we're working on that we're trying to figure out.
crypto executives often led employees to believe that the designs were being provided as part of the consulting arrangement with siemens. but even if that were so, why were encryption flaws so easy to spot, and why were crypto's engineers so routinely blocked from fixing them?

the new york freshman floated the idea in a 60 minutes interview that aired sunday. she said those earning more than $10 million a year should face a top rate of 60 to 70 percent on that income to help pay for a green new deal that would eliminate fossil fuels in 12 years. she is seeking a seat on the house financial services committee, which oversees the banking and housing industry.

the arrest of proud boys leader enrique tarrio on monday, for charges related to the burning of a historically black church's black lives matter flag in a protest last month, has further inflamed far-right conversations online, said eric feinberg, vice president for content moderation for the coalition for a safer web.
such a network would be about ten times as fast as the current speeds available to most consumers today, ncta president michael powell tells me. lab trials of the technology are already underway, and they expect field trials to begin in 2020. he says broadband at these speeds could enable a host of new technologies, by enabling better video streaming or making it easier to use connected home devices. both trends are expected to be in the spotlight this week at the annual trade show.
the current slowdown notwithstanding, 40 years into china's reform and opening, china's regulatory state matters not least because chinese regulators and courts increasingly have influence over global value chains, global markets and the direction of technological innovation.
the new gop law caps how much taxpayers can deduct in state and local taxes at $10,000; previously, the deduction was unlimited. as a result, new york residents could pay an additional $14 billion in federal taxes, cuomo said, and taxpayers in california, new jersey and illinois are also expected to pay more under the change. gov. phil murphy (d-n.j.) told cnbc last month that everything is on the table in terms of combating the gop law, including challenging its legality and constitutionality in court.
helgen continued to contest johnson's ruling, and in december, the museum reversed the decision, clearing helgen's disciplinary record.

children are likely to return en masse to school buildings in 2021, wrapping up our involuntary national experiment with home schooling. but the effects of the pandemic on american education will extend long beyond the end of zoom school. and even before the fights over reopening campuses have ended, attention is turning to the next challenge: how to help children make up the ground they've lost. one answer, experts say, could be an unprecedented large-scale tutoring program.
members on both sides participated, including ranking member nunes, and heard the exact same briefing from experts across the intelligence community, a committee official said. no special or separate briefing was provided to one side or to any single member, including the chairman.
susan b. anthony, arguably the most famous suffrage leader, opposed coalitions. she warned repeatedly that the suffrage movement should isolate itself from other causes, once imploring an organizer to know nothing — push nothing — but suffrage. that backfired, making it easier for political elites to dismiss suffrage.

trump's friday statement said ultimately it will be up to the people of afghanistan to work out their future. we, therefore, urge the afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.
in addition to saving lives and signaling the value of all people independent of their criminal record, the governor may also be able to set a powerful national signal for an effective and appropriate use of executive mercy. as trump uses his clemency to benefit friends with claims of questionable merit, the governors could provide the blueprint on how to reinvigorate the pardon power. northam could take the lead. the service to the state and the country would be immeasurable.
the account identifies the cia officers who ran the program and the company executives entrusted to execute it. it traces the origin of the venture as well as the internal conflicts that nearly derailed it. it describes how the united states and its allies exploited other nations' gullibility for years, taking their money and stealing their secrets.
this has been a persistent claim by the trump campaign in various states — that trump supporters went to vote, only to find their ballot had already been cast (presumably by democratic operatives) and thus they were given a provisional ballot. no evidence has ever emerged to prove this. there have no reports of anyone being turned away on election day, raffensperger told cbs evening news, noting the situation described by trump surely would have been reported.
try says the york guest sleeper sofa is the most comfortable sofa i've ever slept on. the comfort comes from a regular mattress plus an inflatable top layer ($1,799-$1,899, roomandboard.com). the sofa is really well made and looks good, too, she adds. one of her clients has the sectional version in a family room, and it has held up well to abuse from toddlers and a dog.

the companies were feeling the pressure. crowley, purdue's compliance director, wrote to a colleague on march 19, 2008, about dea's latest plans to squeeze the wholesalers and distributors on 'pain clinics,'  according to an email unsealed in the case. crowley predicted that the dea will call distributors into headquarters and read them the riot act, etc.
the biden team is pledging to mend alliances, re-engage international organizations and restore respect for the professional bureaucracy. this team seems well-suited for these initial tasks. but once this low-hanging fruit is picked, the mission gets harder. the famous obama foreign policy focus on pragmatism and process seems ill-suited for the current grave strategic environment because it tilts the scales of policymaking toward rumination and away from decisive action.
referring to trump's incitement of a mob of supporters to occupy the capitol, mulvaney said: we didn't sign up for what you saw last night. we signed up for making america great again. we signed up for lower taxes and less regulation. the president has a long list of successes that we can be proud of. but all of that went away yesterday.

the republican members who plan to reject certain electors read into the constitution and the electoral count act a provision that simply does not exist. the 12th amendment is simple and clear: it calls on congress to perform the ceremonial role of counting electors. there is no allowance for rejecting electors — no matter how much we may disagree with the result or wish the election process had been better.
right now, vaccine distribution is progressing at an unacceptably slow speed, and at this current rate, it will take years to reach herd immunity — if ever. if we are able to pick up speed by many times in january, there is still a chance we could substantially slow down the infection and perhaps approach herd immunity in 2021.

there is no study that will automatically be cut out from review by the agency, he said. what this new rule would undoubtedly do is provide transparency needed to allow the public the opportunity needed to check our work.
no unified theory of trump explains his every provocation or impulsive decision. he has said throughout his life that his primary skill and motivation is to be a showman. and he struggles to balance his craving for respect with his desire to win the spotlight, even when it means alienating the very elites and authorities whose respect he seeks. that's why he talks about hiring the best people as aides, yet often turns on advisers who grab the attention of the media.
lesnar was later found to have failed both an out-of-competition and in-competition test for the two banned substances commonly used in conjunction with anabolic steroids.
futures tied to the technology-heavy nasdaq-100 index fell 1.3 percent on predictions that a democrat-controlled congress could lead to tighter regulations on the industry, the wall street journal's will horner reports. biden and democrats have promised greater scrutiny of the tech giants, and a change of control in congress could increase their odds of pushing through legislation.
helle, who returned to oak harbor late wednesday, said he was glad for the chance to look this gentleman in the eye that's driving the cart and ask him why this is worth removing servicemen and women from voter rolls.
civil rights advocates said diminishing this tool could have sweeping consequences.
the wall street journal should be worried that his involvement, even in a neighborhood squabble, will be viewed as religious intolerance, he said. a reasonable person could see this as approving the exclusion of muslims. they would not be out of line to curtail this as a matter of brand management.
experts said the panic caused by the coronavirus needs to play itself out. there are many unknowns, they said.
but conservatives have long argued that proving discrimination should require proof that someone intended to treat people differently. and they say that if people are being judged by numbers, they may feel pressure to make decisions based on racial quotas.

late last year, some of the president's hawkish advisers drafted a memo committing the united states to a longer-term presence in syria that included goals of an enduring defeat of the islamic state, a political transition and the expulsion of iran, officials said. the president has not signed the memo, which was presented to him weeks ago.
are you in her district? a friend asked. that's really cool.
but republicans weren't alone in adjusting to trumpian trade politics: free trade has achieved record popularity among democrats. it's possible that the end of the trump era will see democrats revert to their usual trade-wariness; most of the democratic presidential contenders don't seem to match their constituents' enthusiasm for free trade. but the beginning of a biden presidency could present a brief, shining opportunity for trade liberalization. he's certainly no fan of trump's tariffs.
feb. 28, 2021, issue: when lockdown started last year, many of us established hobbies to cope with boredom and loneliness. we painted portraits of our pets, pieced together puzzles, baked sourdough bread, folded origami, grew vegetables — the list goes on. now that the pandemic is entering a second year, it might be time for some new activities.

you must account for privacy if you're going to have security. but some privacy advocates believe the change does not go far enough. computer makers will not be able to include the software for turning the identification number off and on when they sell their first batches of the new machines, which are due to hit the market in coming months. instead, users must electronically fetch the program from intel's web site. in addition, the utility program is available only for windows software. -those who use the linux operating system, for instance, must wait until those developers write a similar program. privacy advocates also worry that computer users will be coerced into handing over their identification numbers to get into certain sites on the world wide web – in essence, allowing businesses at those web sites to track precisely what computer users do and to compare that activity with data collected about the individual at other web sites. the default for privacy should be no id number, said david banisar, policy director for the electronic privacy information center, a advocacy group in washington that helped organize the intel boycott. rep. edward j. markey (d-mass. ), ranking member of the commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said he believes consumers need better privacy protections online. i have great concerns about any unique identifier web sites might use without any rules, said markey, who wrote a letter to intel complaining about the chip last week. © copyright the washington post company back to the top
worse, they said, obama tried to set artificial dates for ending the war before it was over. all the taliban had to do was wait him out.
in kabul, u.s. defense secretary mark t. esper said there is real hope for peace in afghanistan, but he warned the taliban to meet its obligations under the deal.
to say or claim we are not doing enough is just not accurate, said alexandria mayor allison silberberg. we are fully committed to getting this done. in 2016 this council has taken major steps forward in commitments, plans and actions.
the afghan war in particular could become a key campaign issue in the upcoming presidential cycle after a decade on the sidelines, and liberal democrats in the house may have more leeway to raise objections to u.s. military involvement under democratic leadership.
you might find one of these two stories more persuasive than the other; chances are it's the one that matches up with the preference you already have for one or the other candidate. but the fact is that neither of the two men with the best chance of being the democratic nominee looks like a strong general election candidate.

he incited violence. he abdicated his responsibility to lead, and he failed to quell violence at the capitol. it's straightforward, said tom bossert, who was trump's first homeland security adviser.

mitt romney was a small business guy if you really think about it, trump says in an interview on cnn. he was a hedge fund. he was a funds guy. he walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. … he'd buy companies; he'd close companies; he'd get rid of jobs.
we've learned our lessons and will be absolutely nowhere near the capitol building, the senior u.s. official said, adding: we don't want to send the wrong message. this is allowing the police to be able to do their jobs.
there has been no afghanistan version of the 9/11 commission, which held the government to account in the wake of the worst terrorist attack on american soil; no afghanistan version of the fulbright hearings, when senators aggressively questioned the war in vietnam; no afghanistan version of the army's official, 1,300-page, introspective history of the war in iraq.
we just wouldn't run up to frederick and say, 'hi, here are all of baltimore's trees,'  the committee chairwoman said.
we will never give up. we will never concede. it doesn't happen. you don't concede when there's theft involved, trump told the crowd to whoops and loud cheers, falsely claiming that president-elect joe biden's victory was based on fraudulent vote counts. we won this election, and we won it by a landslide. this was not a close election.
that's a broadly accurate statement: fifty years ago, the tax rate on the highest bracket of income was indeed over 70 percent. it applied only to income past the first $400,000 or so until 1965, which is presumably what ocasio-cortez meant by the tippy tops.
in a second tweet, he said: the democrats, much as i suspected, have allocated no money for a new wall. so imaginative! the problem is, without a wall there can be no real border security — and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border!
the next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with federalist society members: twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges trump has appointed are or were members of the society. our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, mcgahn quipped to a federalist society gathering in 2017. that is completely false. i've been a member of the federalist society since law school. still am. so, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.
warren, who has not otherwise mentioned the president by name on this trip, added that she could not stop donald trump from what he's gonna do, including hurling racial insults.
podesta tells reporters that russia is responsible for hacking into his account and that the trump campaign knew wikileaks would release his information. he references stone's cryptic tweet days before, saying it would soon be podesta's time in the barrel.

in the senate, republican women will have more influence, whether there is a slim republican majority or a 50-50 split that, with vice president kamala d. harris as the tiebreaker, puts democrats in control. the biden administration is likely to court moderate women such as collins and lisa murkowski (r-alaska) — both of whom helped jump-start negotiations over the latest coronavirus relief bill. to reauthorize the violence against women act, which biden views as one of his career accomplishments, he will need to work with ernst, herself a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence. she and sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.) failed to reach a deal in 2020.

mueller's probe became a lightning rod for criticism under house republican leadership, as gop members alleged that bias displayed by certain fbi and justice department officials working on probes of trump and former secretary of state hillary clinton's use of a private email server compromised the origins of mueller's probe. their concerns drove a year-long investigation into the agencies' conduct, while democrats charged that gop lawmakers were simply trying to help the president undermine mueller.

but it might be all they've got. as of now, mcconnell has given no indication that he will bring up the clean funding bills unless trump indicates he'll sign them. remember, though, that before the holidays, mcconnell's senate overwhelmingly passed a clean spending bill to keep the government running through feb. 8 but was then rolled by the president, who decided after the fact that he couldn't support it. mcconnell's spokesman, don stewart, told the fix that without assurance from the president that he'll sign it, mcconnell's not going to take shell votes for the sake of shell votes.

today, barnett is a professor of constitutional law at georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the affordable care act, medical marijuana and the like. but his first encounter with the federalist society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at chicago-kent college of law. a student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early federalist society national student symposiums. barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the constitution. but he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. so he said yes.

in the very recent past, democrats offered trump some options. in december, they were prepared to give him $2.1 billion for border security, but trump said he would accept nothing less than $5 billion (now $5.7 billion). after that, democrats officially gained control of the house and dug in, saying they won't give any money for a wall. now they're talking about approving trump's dollar amount for other border security enhancements but stipulating that it can't be used for any kind of physical barrier. but again, trump has made clear that no wall money means no government reopening.

because it is not an investment bank — risk-taking in the investment banking sector helped cause the 2008 financial crisis — blackrock could present itself as a constructive voice with useful perspectives on a range of issues facing policymakers, former officials said. the federal reserve bank of new york turned to blackrock for help in 2008, asking it to oversee failing assets held by bear stearns and american international group. during meetings at the white house and in congress during the obama era, fink would offer his insights on the health-care industry, infrastructure and gig workers, said people who met with him. blackrock has further honed this stance through its investment institute, a sort of internal think tank that publishes bulletins with commentary on geopolitics, and an entire section on its website devoted to commentary on financial stability.
at about 777 events, or 97.6 percent of the total, police made no arrests. this was a slightly higher percentage of arrest-free protests than in the past few months. the numbers of protesters arrested increased from 128 in november to 371 in december, with at least 360 (more than 97 percent) of those coming in 14 cases of nonviolent civil disobedience. for example, 84 people were arrested at the u.s. capitol while protesting the republican tax plan.

even as trump faces an impeachment trial, his trip to davos offers him an opportunity to focus on his economic message. the u.s. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. trump signed a partial trade deal with china last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs.

but the intelligence kept coming, current and former officials said, in part because of bureaucratic inertia. many governments just never got around to switching to newer encryption systems proliferating in the 1990s and beyond — and unplugging their crypto devices. this was particularly true of less developed nations, according to the documents.

in this vein, roy did something else clever on sunday evening as the new congress was sworn in. to make a point, he objected to the swearing-in of all members from the six states where trump falsely claims the vote was rigged. this forced the house to vote on whether the lawmakers who were on the same ballot with the president – and won their races – should be allowed to take the oath. naturally, republicans wanted to seat their members from georgia, arizona, michigan, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin. the vote was 371 to 2 to say that all of their elections were legitimate.

as for the china deal, the agreement seems more like a truce designed to not make things worse as the united states enters an election year. my post colleague heather long points out: from a short-term perspective, the deal doesn't seem so great. china's additional purchases make amends for only a fraction of the trade war's hit to the economy, analysts say. and the bulk of the purchasing in the deal could have happened in the summer of 2018 without trump ramping up tariffs.

the denver post's mark kiszla recently asked in a column advocating the acquisition of romo, can denver really afford to waste another year of this championship defense with a young quarterback not ready for prime time? gary kubiak tried that bluff this year, and it ended with ugly shouting in a locker room divided by the frustration of seven losses.
the d.c. health department does urge pharmacists to use doses on any available person rather than let them expire. however, hospitals and health centers have an on-call list of their own staff who are not front-line workers but who could get vaccinated if an extra dose needs to be used. hanging out at your nearest pharmacy, or calling grocery stores, is not at all likely to get you a vaccination — and spending extra time in public places is a very bad idea if you're not vaccinated.

you saw this with sen. rob portman (r-ohio), who only began to support same-sex marriage when his son came out as gay. or with jared kushner, who decided to make criminal justice reform a signature issue because of his father's experiences being convicted and imprisoned for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering. chris christie — who, incidentally, had prosecuted charles kushner as new jersey's attorney general — recently filmed a video begging his constituents to wear masks, but only after he'd contracted the coronavirus after attending a white house ceremony, maskless.

— in a report exploring jpmorgan chase's relationship with amazon, the wall street journal's emily glazer, laura stevens and annamaria andriotis described how the bank imitates some of the management practices that amazon founder and chief executive jeffrey p. bezos established at the online retail giant. mr. bezos notoriously banned slide presentations to keep amazon in startup mode as it grew, instead asking employees to craft six-page documents complete with a press release and faqs, according to the journal. over roughly the past 18 months, jpmorgan has started a similar practice in its consumer businesses under gordon smith, the bank's co-president and co-chief operating officer, [jpmorgan] employees said. jpmorgan has also embraced bezos's customer obsession, an approach requiring employees to start developing products with consumers in mind and then work backward, per the journal. (bezos owns the post.)
during the republican national convention, russian ambassador sergey kislyak speaks with trump advisers j.d. gordon and carter page. gordon would later say he was part of the push to soften the gop's national security platform regarding u.s. support for ukraine in its fight against russian-backed separatists. kislyak meets with jeff sessions at a panel at the convention hosted by the heritage foundation.
those same problems now afflict the distribution of the vaccine, the miracle of scientific achievement that has the potential to bring the pandemic to an end. the lamentable difference is that this time, we've had months to think about the issues at stake and to prepare. scientists and boards of ethicists have done the work. yet politicians still seem clueless or cowardly, unwilling to lead the public through the excruciating questions that need to be asked and answered.

in another quick move potentially reflecting the new landscape, biden wednesday planned to name merrick garland as attorney general. biden aides said the georgia race did not affect that decision, but given garland's symbolic role as a democratic martyr after his nomination to the supreme court was torpedoed by republicans in 2016, his confirmation could have been tougher with the gop in control.

the inflation-adjusted price per pure gram of heroin fell nearly tenfold, from $3,260 in 1981 to $465 in 2012. the more the feds spent on supply reduction, in other words, the cheaper heroin got (federal data shows that the prices of other drugs, like cocaine and methamphetamines, fell similarly during this period). that's the exact opposite of what's supposed to happen, and of what comey says will happen if we crack down on the heroin supply further.

while decades of first amendment case law prevents officials at public universities from restricting what their employees can say, or punishing them for expressing their views, private schools like babson have much greater leeway. so when academics have made controversial posts on social media about any number of news items — mass shootings, the death of former first lady barbara bush or north korea's imprisonment of otto warmbier — their posts have resulted in a range of disciplinary outcomes.
the change of tack amid the covid-19 lockdown and subsequent recovery showed the limits of ambitious industrial policy. china has spent much of the last year focusing on policies to become self-sufficient, scarred by the u.s.-induced rebuke over its practices in global trade and rocky rebound out of the pandemic. a key part of beijing's economic blueprint for the next five years is to bolster high-end manufacturing of machines, 5g equipment and semiconductors for use in the domestic market. state funding is increasingly being targeted toward these industries. the government also wants to upgrade internal supply chains and maintain its role as the world's factory floor. china is by far the largest end-user of industrial robots, but the number of robots installed per 10,000 employees remains relatively low.

multiple tv journalists have flatly declared that trump has revealed himself as a racist. it's good that it's now safe to say this on prime-time television, but we already knew that. what this episode also does is shatter the endless euphemisms and dissembling that trump and his allies have employed to obscure a related truth: that the nationalism at the core of trumpism is heavily driven by a reactionary backlash to the current ethnic and racial mix of the u.s. population — it is white nationalism, despite all the what-me-racist protestation to the contrary.

on behalf of myself, my family and, i am sure, a great many of my fellow members of woodmont country club, i apologize to president obama and his family for the expressions of concern about his family's membership in our club solely because of his administration's recent decision concerning the u.n. vote on israeli settlements [jewish country club split on accepting obama, metro, jan. 14]. the expressed concerns are not held by our membership generally, the club as an entity or by a majority of jewish americans throughout the country. we should be proud to have mr. obama as a member of our club; i believe most of the club's members agree. that some members consider u.s. policy on israel — good or bad — as the principal criterion for club membership is a sorry state of affairs, particularly because half of israelis apparently agree that settlements in the west bank are not in the best interests of israel and that freedom of expression is a hallmark of both the american and israeli democracies.

naomi argues that other factors, such as solar energy, play a role — though the amount of solar energy reaching the earth has actually declined since the 1970s, according to federal measurements. a slew of peer-reviewed reports, from scientific bodies in the u.s. and elsewhere, have concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century, producing a range of devastating effects from massive marine die-offs in south america to severe wildfires in australia and sinking ground in the arctic.
trump is an outlier at the forum for his views on climate change. the president has publicly criticized global efforts to combat rising temperatures and has made ridiculing energy-efficient products a key part of his reelection stump speeches.

for too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the federalist society, says elizabeth wydra, president of the constitutional accountability center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. when you actually look at the text and history of the entire constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the civil war, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the federalist society, would have you believe about our constitution. the cac has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th amendment's equal protection clause. the cac also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of congress who claim trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.

as the ones usually tasked with bringing climate change information to their students, teachers are increasingly taking on the weight of the psychological implications. lisa balazs, a science teacher at a private school outside birmingham, ala., told me she persuaded her school to offer a specialized climate change class last year. she wanted to walk students through the physics and chemistry of the changing climate, but also focus on solutions. i wanted them to feel like they were empowered in the way you could have an intelligent conversation, she says. the scary part is feeling like there's nothing you individually can do, especially when you look at the government. so turning it around and putting it back in your personal control, this is what you can vote for and work for.

trump has also taken aim at german carmakers, asking why so many americans drive a mercedes-benz when germany buys so few chevrolets, and criticizing bmw over plans to build a new plant in mexico. his criticism may have been unjustified, as bertel schmidt argues in forbes, but perhaps only to be expected.
studying that emotional response forced duffy to reevaluate her syllabus. this past fall, she added a second lesson about solutions, highlighting the drop in the cost of renewable energy and improvements in battery technology for storing clean energy. it's a strategy duffy says is necessary for any climate communicator, but especially one working with young minds. there's a danger in having the instruction emphasize climate catastrophe, she says. it's tempting to say how bad things are, how much we need to stop it. but at some point you've accidentally said this is a foregone conclusion. we can overemphasize how scary it is to the point where people feel hopeless and panicked.
a lawyer for paul manafort says a bid to revive a fraud case against him is unsupportable.
ultimately, the dea and federal prosecutors would contend that the company ignored its responsibility to report suspicious orders as 500 million of its pills ended up in florida between 2008 and 2012 — 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state. government investigators alleged in internal documents that the company's lack of due diligence could have resulted in nearly 44,000 federal violations and exposed it to $2.3 billion in fines, according to confidential government records and emails obtained by the washington post.
barber's move turned out to be a key moment in the struggle between drug companies and the government, but it was far from the only one. dozens of top officials from the dea and justice department have stepped through washington's revolving door to work for drug companies.
you'd have to believe he wanted garoppolo to embarrass the patriots — as opposed to hoping that by sending him to a struggling team across the country and in an opposite division and conference in the nfc west, under a first-year head coach, he likely wouldn't come back to beat them on the field any time soon.
interior deputy secretary kate macgregor, who stood before a camera and read the bids out loud as she pulled them out of manila folders, announced at the start of the sale, today is truly historic. noting that many people had spent years working to open the refuge up to drilling, she said, thank you for your grit and for your determination.

the unusual religious language, however, is not an example of u.s. legislators pontificating on the tibetan religion, said bhuchung k. tsering, vice president of the international campaign for tibet, which helped congressional leaders frame the legislation. rather, the clauses on reincarnation are aimed at preserving tibet's cultural and political distinctiveness.
he said republicans had to keep fighting and urged a crowd of aggrieved supporters to mount an insurrection against constitutional order on wednesday, encouraging what quickly became a mob assault on the u.s. capitol carried out in his name. the fabrications were familiar, but this time, trump's angry rant amounted to a call to arms.

compared with the price of one of the new verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. so switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. because the customer used only about 7.9 gb of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to verizon's 8 gb plan. but that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially.
in some sectors like 5g, china has doubtless made significant progress. however, the country will continue to rely on japanese companies for the high-tech niche of manufacturing for a while to come. consider this: chinese suppliers command more than 80% of the market share for simple-task linear and cartesian robots used in the plastics industry. but when it comes to articulated robots, which have more complex multi-axis movements, foreign makers manufacture droves more in and for china, according to clsa ltd. analysts. such machines accounted for over 60% of sales. japan is one of the largest exporters of industrial robots.

the elevation of sullivan and finer represents some generational turnover. but other younger former obama national security officials — now vying for jobs in the incoming administration — told me they feel frustrated with the lack of upward mobility because of the clog of older people at the top who won't leave the stage. there's also frustration among the progressive foreign policy wing of the democratic party, which has been publicly airing its own lists of candidates (a practice that usually backfires for those doing the airing).

in a letter to trump, the groups said that while it is too early to reliably predict the additional costs and needs of a covid-19 response, the administration should act quickly so that sufficient funds could be appropriated to stay ahead of the curve and perhaps pursue a strategy to enact multiple appropriations on an as-needed basis as the situation unfolds.
does that make sense? to be sure, in some circumstances, it might be proper for courts to ignore the effect of foreign divorces that are based on procedures that u.s. law views as improper. for instance, american courts might reject application of foreign law that they see as unfair when it affects the rights of people who were u.s. residents at the time of the divorce. likewise, american courts may want to apply american norms to child custody rights when the children are living in the united states. but outside these special circumstances, courts shouldn't categorically ignore the effect of foreign divorces that involve departures from american equality norms.

under that version of history, the prewar south was a land of magnolias and chivalry where women were belles, men were noble cavaliers and black people were happy to be enslaved. it was no coincidence that the lost cause took root in the post-war years of reconstruction, undercutting social advances and shackling black americans to bad jobs and poor schooling for another century.
nothing, though, has occupied his time like his obsession about somehow undoing the election that will return him to the private sector. the majority of his tweets over the past two months have centered on election-related conspiracy theories that he has invented or picked up from cable news and various right-wing voices in the media. he has tweeted a lot about what he sees on television, as he usually does, and has clearly spent an inordinate amount of time huddling with lawyers and allies to figure out what new spaghetti to throw at the wall.

critics including democratic lawmakers soon called on the company to suspend the president's account, repeating their long-held belief that silicon valley should stop trump from spreading harmful misinformation at viral scale. but twitter at the time said its policies allow world leaders to share their views unfettered, a view the company has maintained even as trump has intensified his rhetoric.

even though income-driven repayment plays are underutilized — some borrowers don't know about them — roughly half of people with student debt are in such plans. a typical idr program requires that a borrower pay 15 percent of any discretionary income — defined as income above 150 percent of the poverty line. after 20 or 25 years, the balance is forgiven, regardless of the amount due.

new public housing projects, opened on an ostensibly desegregated basis, were primarily populated by black households. simultaneously, the housing authority of baltimore city blamed black families themselves for the lack of meaningful desegregation, claiming black residents were uninterested in moving to white areas. the color line remained stubbornly in place, even absent formal racial designations — giving people a choice of where to live in public housing in still deeply segregated neighborhoods did nothing to address it. even 30 years later, three particular housing projects in the majority-black city still had 70 to 80 percent white residents.

because russia and the united states are on different sides, it's no surprise that russian president vladimir putin welcomed trump's abrupt decision to withdraw nearly 2,000 u.s. troops from syria. in a news conference dec. 20, putin gave extended remarks clearly in support of trump's move.

but in truth, the stew of alternative facts has been simmering for more than half a century on the right fringe. the gop had endless opportunities across the decades to banish these theories — about scheming bureaucrats, jews, the federal reserve, the united nations — and its leaders often saw them as absurd. but they were also useful, helping to rally support from an aggrieved government-hating base. so the party's mandarins allowed them to fester and grow until they spread from the toxic fringe to the mainstream, which they have finally overtaken. it's no wonder someone who embraced those ideas would become successful; trump validates notions that his voters have long believed, ideas that the party refused to condemn and failed to repudiate.
flight tracking data from flightradar24 showed the ukrainian airliner taking off from tehran imam khomeini international airport in a northwesterly direction before losing contact near the suburb of parand.
it is also obvious that trump's attempt to intimidate particular outlets and reporters — of which his fake news awards is only the latest and most cretinous example — hasn't tamed them in the way he wants. journalists such as cnn's jake tapper or jim acosta have, if anything, become even more openly critical after trump attacked them personally. here again, the president took an old conservative tactic to an extreme, and it backfired. while conservatives found great success in charging reporters with liberal bias, which often led them to bend over backward to prove they were being objective, trump's personal attacks have only caused reporters to dig in on their professionalism and demonstrate that they won't be cowed.
the u.s. government's top infectious-disease doctor, a leading drug regulator and the health and human services secretary are dismissing suggestions that the second shot of authorized coronavirus vaccines could be delayed to make more doses available faster to more people, carolyn johnson reports. in recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimen that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges. the debate is playing out as the united states struggles with administering the doses it already has. more than 15 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, according to centers for disease control and prevention data updated monday morning, but only about 4.5 million have been administered. … last week, the united kingdom made the controversial decision to prioritize giving a first dose of its authorized vaccines — even if it meant there wasn't enough to give people a booster shot within the recommended three to four weeks. u.k. authorities have said people could wait as long as 12 weeks. limited data suggests a single shot affords some protection against disease, but it is not known how complete or long the protection lasts.

during the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and planned parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. at this point, the analysis of trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including vice president pence (who spoke at last year's march) and charmaine yoest, longtime leader of americans united for life and now a top communications executive at the department of health and human services.

some fed banking regulations exceeded even international standards under tarullo, ed mills, a policy analyst at investment bank fbr capital markets, said in a research note. tarullo is arguably one of the most powerful u.s. banking regulators since alexander hamilton, mills said. added ian katz, financial policy analyst with the research firm capital alpha partners, tarullo was the most consequential figure in financial regulation in the dodd-frank era, and we can't even think of who would be in second place.
that was true from specifics — her demand that presidential candidates release their taxes, which the president has refused to do — to the generic — her repeated lament that the middle class has been hollowed out as economic and political fairness has been lost.
you would never know that negotiations between the afghan government and the taliban have made little appreciable progress or that the taliban's terrorist campaign is worse than ever. or that north korea now has more nuclear materials or missiles — along with the capability to strike the u.s. mainland with them — than when trump and pompeo took office. or that the maduro regime remains entrenched in venezuela. i'd bet that pompeo will soon claim credit for exiting the iranian nuclear deal and killing iranian general qasem soleimani without noting that iran has ramped up uranium production and hasn't curbed its destabilizing activities.
the law was the crowning achievement of a multifaceted campaign by the drug industry to weaken aggressive dea enforcement efforts against drug distribution companies that were supplying corrupt doctors and pharmacists who peddled narcotics to the black market. the industry worked behind the scenes with lobbyists and key members of congress, pouring more than a million dollars into their election campaigns.

linda gustitus, president of the national religious campaign against torture, said obama 'has already changed the world with respect to america's use of torture.' kate martin of the center for national security studies said the orders represented an 'extraordinary first step towards ending the illegalities and abuses of the last seven years.' jennifer daskal, senior counterterrorism counsel for human rights watch, said the interrogations order 'makes meaningful the us commitment not to torture detainees' and that 'president obama has rejected the abusive practices of the last seven-and-a-half years.' caroline fredrickson, washington director of the aclu, said obama had given the u.s. 'a much-needed and significant break from the bush administration policies that, with utter disregard for our constitution, trampled our nation's values and ideals.'

georgia gov. brian kemp (r) might have erred by appointing loeffler last year to replace johnny isakson when the senator retired for health reasons. this put him at loggerheads with trump, who had pushed kemp to appoint rep. doug collins (r), a frequent defender of the president on fox news. collins challenged loeffler from the right, and to make it to the runoff, she lurched far to the right. but the first-time candidate often did so in ham-handed and cartoonish ways.

trump has repeatedly accused powell of raising interest rates so fast that it's hurting the economy, but the fed argues that the economy is expanding faster than normal and no longer needs low rates to stimulate growth.
dan mahanty, director for u.s. program at the center for civilians in conflict, said the report reflected improved military transparency about its operations overseas. but the lack of information from intelligence agencies brings the government's inconsistency further into relief and undermines this achievement, he said.
yeah, congress, the spending bill that they forced on him in order to get the military spending up to where it needed to be — he said that would be the last time he signed one of those. but he had no choice because obama had decimated the military, and it had to be rebuilt.

there were more clues: there was some healthy food in his fridge, but no stockpile of insulin. as nicole cleaned out his cluttered blue car, littered with old prescription receipts, she started to cobble together just how much his insulin and blood sugar testing supplies cost without insurance or discounts. the total, by her count, was nearly $1,300 per month. that was roughly the same amount that alec's local pharmacy tallied for me nearly a year later, using a list of his medications and medical supplies. it's very expensive to be diabetic without insurance, the pharmacist said. that $1,300 was almost $200 more than alec's biweekly paycheck.

the complexity of the current situation and the sheer scale of production mean a new agreement will be required. national governments will need to negotiate, consider and approve various requirements – all long processes. if disparities between countries crop up, manufacturers will face barriers to production and distribution. the alternative is national compensation funds, which honor claims for those who have suffered adverse effects from the vaccines. many countries simply can't afford these, further reinforcing the resource and investment imbalance.

they're paying attention because they don't think this guy can be reelected, said rep. john delaney (d-md.), who has already visited all 99 counties in his presidential bid. and the takeaway i hear from a lot of democrats is that 2016 wasn't a good primary. it was about people going into their camps early. this year, it's the opposite; democrats are focused on how we beat this guy in 2020, and they come into the primary process with an open mind.
no. the conflict had been brewing for years. with its oil riches and custodianship of islam's holiest sites, saudi arabia has long seen itself as the natural leader of the gulf region, if not the entire middle east. its strongest competitor is iran, with whom it has a testy relationship. since qatar began to grow wealthy from natural gas exports two decades ago, it has asserted its independence from the saudis and sought cordial ties with iran, with whom it shares a gigantic offshore gas field. at stake: almost 50 trillion cubic meters of proven gas reserves, according to qatar energy minister saad sherida al kaabi. in the meantime, israel made peace deals with the uae and bahrain in 2020, underscoring that it's now iran — rather than the israeli-palestinian conflict — that's the focus of the region's geopolitical disputes.

despite beijing's regulatory efforts, td-scdma and td-lte are not widely adopted outside of china. this time around, chinese companies (from datang to huawei and zte) own in total about 10 percent of 5g-essential intellectual property rights (ipr). the 2017 adoption of huawei's polar coding methodology by 3gpp, the global wireless standards-setting body, will likely raise that number as telecom companies around the world, including in canada and india, deploy huawei technology for 5g networks.
sissi cracks a small smile and tells the interviewer, scott pelley, that he has no idea where human rights watch got that figure.
obsessed with polls, they still called the election wrong. they helped crown the democratic party's favored nominee, hillary clinton, literally years before the party convention. they allowed donald trump to dominate coverage as he wished. in the name of fairness, they focused on personality flaws and relatively minor mistakes while failing to effectively drive home obvious character disasters.

mcconnell's stance prompted angry attacks thursday from new house speaker nancy pelosi (calif.) and other democrats, who insisted they were trying to give republicans a way out of the standoff by passing two pieces of legislation: one a package of six spending bills that were negotiated on a bipartisan basis in the senate and would reopen nearly all the federal agencies that have been shuttered since dec. 22, and the second a stopgap spending bill through feb. 8 covering only the department of homeland security.

there is a lot of disagreement in the scientific literature about the herd immunity threshold, which is certain to vary from place to place. i don't think anyone responsible would confidently say what it is, and would never put forward a single number for the u.s. as a whole. rather, the key question is how rapidly we inoculate people who have a high risk of mortality conditional on infection — most older folks and some late middle-aged folks with severe chronic conditions. prioritizing them for vaccination will yield the greatest benefit in reducing covid-19-related mortality, regardless of when herd immunity is hit.

while the gop was actively courting allies who propagated conspiracy theories, the democratic party took much the opposite tack — mostly rejecting the outlandish left-wing theories that surfaced from time to time. although some research has found a recent uptick in democratic support for conspiracy theories (a jump caused by a lack of political power), elected democrats have typically fenced their party off from wild-eyed claims promulgated on the left. they never embraced the theory that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job carried out by the bush administration, for example. during the 2004 presidential primary race, even the most lefty antiwar candidates — dennis kucinich, howard dean, carol moseley braun — largely eschewed conspiracy theories that president george w. bush and vice president dick cheney had gone to war for oil or to enrich their friends in the construction business. the left has its share of anti-vaxxers who believe that vaccines cause autism, yet democratic officials have battled that lie (which trump himself has promoted).

like some other scholars, rick worries that foot voting may become pointless if the benefits of good government become capitalized into the value of land: housing in well-governed jurisdictions becomes more expensive to the point that there is no benefit to moving there from poorly governed ones. in my book democracy and political ignorance, i explain why this concern is overstated.

aiyer's unauthorized rides apparently went unnoticed for at least two years by budget officials who reviewed the invoices from alexandria yellow cab, which has a contract to provide authorized taxi services for agency officials. the patent office paid the taxi company more than $4,000 for aiyer's rides, the report says.
trump's claims, which persist after georgia certified joe biden's win last month after three counts of ballots, are all easily, provably false, sterling said at the news conference. yet the president persists and by doing so undermines georgians' faith in the electoral system, especially republican georgians.
despite the earlier absence of an administrator, ostp over the past two years has forged ahead with a full agenda. it has sought to advance private-sector research in areas such as artificial intelligence, in part by convening tech giants and other industry experts for a new, policy-focused task force in 2018. it has helped guide the white house's early work to put more self-flying drones in u.s. skies and expand internet access to rural areas. during that time, the office's most senior official was michael kratsios, a former aide to venture capitalist peter thiel. kratsios joined the administration in its early days to serve as deputy chief technology officer.

virginia recently registered the highest infection rate ever in its state correctional facilities, but northam continues to sit on his hands. despite his leadership in addressing coronavirus challenges and his support of criminal justice reform, he has failed to use the power of clemency inherent in his office to make early prison releases possible, instead condemning inmates, staff and prison towns to unnecessary exposure.

nicole wanted pharmaceutical companies to start by being more transparent about their prices — to disclose how much it costs to manufacture a vial of insulin and what the profit margin on each vial is. ultimately, she wanted them to reduce the price. they're going to tell you it's complicated or they can't share that information with you, she said to a reporter. it's not all that complicated. they're choosing to make it complicated. it's just plain greed.

to say that i've struggled with my weight all my life is a blatant misuse of the term struggle. i've rarely cared much; i've mostly accepted it as part of who i am and learned to live with it. but early in 2016, something changed. i wasn't feeling great. i knew my weight was up, but i hadn't checked in a while. mostly because i didn't want to know. and i was staring down the barrel of my 50th birthday.
space has also become a new front in corporate battles funded by billionaire entrepreneurs. there's a race to flood earth's orbit with satellites that would beam the internet to billions of people without access to broadband. and there's the human race: having flown nasa astronauts to the international space station for the first time in 2020, elon musk's spacex is ahead of rival boeing, which stumbled in the development of its new capsule. both companies plan to fly astronauts in 2021, and spacex is even planning a launch that could ferry private space tourists.

sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) has also emphasized the imperative for republicans to safeguard the sanctity of the electoral college in opposing cruz and co. congress would imperil the electoral college, which gives small states like arkansas a voice in presidential elections, he said in a statement. democrats could achieve their long-standing goal of eliminating the electoral college in effect by refusing to count electoral votes in the future for a republican president-elect.
federalists' embarrassment turned to outrage after they learned how madison obtained the documents. they charged that he had paid a vast sum of public money to foreign nationals for his personal political benefit. madison admitted in a private letter that the documents did not legally implicate federalists even though they proved that britain had tried to enlist federalists' help.

most states, including nebraska, have been abiding by federal recommendations to provide vaccines to front-line health-care workers first, followed by residents and staff at nursing homes. but the question of who should get the vaccine next, and when, has proved politically fraught across the nation.
in several states, health officials were caught off guard when governors suddenly announced availability would expand to senior citizens or others. some state officials chose to depart from centers for disease control and prevention guidelines for the second vaccination priority group, which prioritized front-line essential workers alongside people 75 and older.

gentleness is the only constructive response. of course we need to applaud people when they change their minds, of course we need to welcome them wholeheartedly to the team, of course we need to bite our tongues when they discover 40-year-old talking points, of course we need to recognize that someone like mccain might be a more resonant voice for conservative viewers than liberals like goldberg or joy behar. righteously scolding latecomers is gratifying but counterproductive to the cause — a self-centered move in its own right.
the national army accounts for most of the afghan security forces, with about 162,000 troops. it reports to the defense ministry and includes the afghan air force and other units.

eboni-rose thompson, the chair of the ward 7 education council, said she fears the changes would mean less access to high-quality schools. in ward 7, for example, there are no dual-language charter schools. most of those schools are in wards 1 and 4. under the proposal, some students in ward 1 might have greater access to those schools because they live near them. that would leave fewer seats available for students from ward 7.

the school decision highlights the problem at the heart of moral parenting. we want to teach our children to be ethical, yet is parenting in itself a constant choice between what is best for our individual child and what is best for all children?
but biden and the myriad obama-era veterans in his administration also have grander ambitions, beyond setting the clock back to 2016: he says he aims to counter the global tide of rising authoritarianism. his aides have floated new geopolitical groupings that would prioritize human rights and liberal values, an alliance of democracies that could serve as a counterweight to autocrats and elected illiberal strongmen. biden also says he'll put the world's kleptocrats on notice and bring greater transparency to the global financial system. targeting corruption and illicit tax havens, the thinking goes, would chip away at the inequities that fuel nationalist populism.
sen. richard j. durbin of illinois, a lead democratic negotiator on immigration, called trump's detailed request outrageous and said he would continue working instead with republicans who understand what is at stake in hopes of striking a bipartisan deal.

this openness to the potential recruitment of gay people in intelligence work was ultimately cast aside as the cold war inspired a second, more insidious, rationale for denying security clearances to gays: that subversive sexuality inclined one to subversive politics. the specter of a homosexual international, sinister, mysterious, efficient, was conjured to accompany the all-powerful communist one. a series of high-profile cases involving homosexuality and communist espionage bolstered this prejudice.
so, we don't know who's going to win this thing. but we have a better idea of what is and isn't going to matter when democrats start piling in.
the group's formation builds on unprecedented protests by google workers in recent years. while the tech industry has seen minimal union activity and worker pushback historically, thousands of people at alphabet had banded together to publicly criticize google's handling of sexual harassment complaints, its work with the u.s. military and other issues.
there may be others. some may be under consideration or discussion even now. and we do see examples of journalism based on public interest — not just charts comparing stances on issues, but meaningful, engaging explorations of how tax or immigration policy affects real lives and pocketbooks; but they are vastly outweighed by horse race or shiny-object coverage.

nicole now believes that alec was rationing his insulin because of the cost. based upon what he had left when he was found, we came to the conclusion that he had not filled his prescription, so he had to have been rationing for a short period of time, nicole told me. we realized that he had been taking less insulin and less often than he should, trying to make it stretch until he got his next paycheck. he was found dead three days before payday.

i believe that if we can increase voter turnout by 5 percent from 2014, democrats will regain the house and senate. but you cannot do that unless ordinary people believe you are fighting for them, sanders said in an interview. if it's more tax breaks for billionaires and huge increases in military spending, you have a lot of working people and young people who will say: 'it doesn't make a difference. why should i be involved?'
policies and trainings on sexuality, aging and dementia have the potential to both protect the autonomy and independence of older adults in assisted living and prevent staff and administrators from acting according to stereotypes rather than the true needs of older adults. while more research is needed, we believe that all adults, regardless of age or living arrangements, should be able pursue love and intimacy.
-- warren's senate colleagues are not jumping to endorse her — or any of her prospective challengers. politico's burgess everett reports: even sen. ed markey isn't ready to endorse his fellow massachusetts democrat, at least not yet. 'when she is moving forward, we're going to be talking,' markey said as he prepared for warren's swearing in to another term in the senate. 'i've just got to get today done.' warren's hard-edged brand of progressive politics has annoyed some of her colleagues at times, but the lack of support from her caucus isn't personal. with a wide open democratic primary, including perhaps a half-dozen of warren's own colleagues set to join the race, there's no sense in getting out ahead of anyone, according to a dozen democratic senators from across the ideological spectrum.
women have a particularly powerful political tool in their common identity, but one that will take more careful leadership decisions than those of suffragists to reach its full potential. a diverse group of women organizers at the helm of the women's march was important for just this reason: it builds the coalitional potential of a new movement. whether coalition approaches continue — both nationally and locally — will matter tremendously for any future movement's effectiveness.
disparate impact was written into the original regulations that implemented title vi of the 1964 civil rights act, which bars discrimination based on race, color or national origin by entities, including schools, that receive federal funding. the school safety report argued that earlier administrations had adopted the concept without regard for what the underlying statute said. it said that interpretation was of questionable validity and dubious, at best.

we will argue that thousands of orders from the distributors as well as tens of thousands of orders from these down-stream customers were suspicious because of the pattern of distribution to florida, prosecutors wrote. in all, they said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious — orders that mallinckrodt should have reported to the dea.

there is public interest value in the preservation of those stories, said alex howard, a government transparency advocate who previously served as deputy director of the nonprofit sunlight foundation.

for many football players, there's little time to think about a plan b. since they were young, they spent afternoons and summers on football fields or in weight rooms — not working jobs, not applying for internships or anything else that might work on a résumé. when football is no longer an option, many are left with no practical work experience, limited contacts and often no clue about what other fields might be worth pursuing.

jan. 3: trump said during a cabinet meeting that iran's leadership can do what they want in syria.
it is particularly troubling that the proposed rule seeks to so broadly expand the religious exemption that it would allow companies claiming sincerely held religious beliefs to discriminate against catholics, jews or, for example, lgbtq individuals, pregnant and unmarried women, interracial married couples, divorced men and women, and other workers who do not conform to their employers' beliefs, scott wrote to labor secretary eugene scalia last month. for the first time ever, for-profit companies, not just religious nonprofit organizations, would be allowed to use taxpayer dollars to discriminate on the basis of religion or religious beliefs in federal contracts.

but with the exception of beto o'rourke, democrats in swing races evaded the impeachment issue; they gave the sort of wait for mueller' answers that warren gave this weekend in iowa. and the impeachment issue was more potentially potent in the midterms than it can possibly be in 2020. either the house will impeach the president, or it won't; if it does, it will be as the first step in a process that republicans get behind, in the sort of drama that is unthinkable right now. if it doesn't, the president will be on the ballot in 22 months, making the question completely irrelevant.

people don't vote because of sympathy they have for you, holsworth said. they want to know what you're going to do for them.
the announced deal, though, is an indication of a different reality. merkel and french president emmanuel macron have both separately emphasized the need for europe to develop its strategic autonomy, weaning itself off more than half a century of sheltering under the umbrella of the pax americana. but, in this instance, critics note, europe may be undermining what prospect there was of a meaningful united front on china.
comments from the most politically vulnerable members of mcconnell's caucus suggested discomfort with the majority leader's approach, and a desire for a quick resolution to the shutdown.
and there is a final benefit for biden: with new democratic leaders of the senate committees, republicans' long-threatened hearings into his son hunter's business dealings will likely be derailed.
the white house wants to set discretionary defense spending levels at about $603 billion, which would exceed current automatic spending caps by $54 billion. republicans think non-defense levels should see less of an increase, closer to $35 billion. but democrats are insisting on parity, arguing in recent weeks that non-defense spending bolsters programs to fight opioid addiction and terrorism and protect the southern border.
u.s. envoy zalmay khalilzad and taliban deputy leader mullah abdul ghani baradar inked the deal on an ornate desk in an opulent hall at a hotel in doha, qatar, on saturday. secretary of state mike pompeo attended the ceremony and witnessed the signing while seated across from the two men.
trump, who suggested the shutdown could last for months or even years, displayed woeful ignorance of the plight of federal workers at a news conference friday, when he said they would encourage him to keep going with the shutdown, because a border wall is far more important than a fully operational government. he apparently got that impression from border patrol officers he met with thursday. these officers, federal workforce outliers, endorsed his wall, just as they did his candidacy, even though they are also victims of his shutdown.
conte, 29, said in an interview wednesday he enjoyed working at the college-preparatory school of 470 students — where he had served as junior varsity field hockey coach and assistant track coach — but was not surprised by his dismissal. i knew it was only a matter of time, he said.

in afghanistan, nato took the lead of the international security assistance force, which at one point topped 130,000 troops. the united states contributed 90,000 of those troops, but it was still important diplomatically that countries as small as montenegro and luxembourg contributed to the effort. the united kingdom had more than 450 soldiers killed in afghanistan, including more than 400 in hostile action.
by the end of 1979 the insurgency was threatening to depose the central government in kabul, and the kremlin had lost confidence in the recently ascended afghan leader hafizullah amin. citing the brezhnev doctrine, which held that once a country had turned communist, moscow would resolve to keep it in the revolutionary camp, the soviet leadership decided to execute a full political and military takeover of afghanistan. on december 25, 1979, soviet forces invaded the country and killed amin in kabul at the presidential palace. two days later president carter approved a new covert action to send lethal aid to the afghan mujahidin insurgents, rebuked the invasion in a strongly worded letter to brezhnev, and undertook an array of diplomatic and economic sanctions in consultation with u.s. allies to protest soviet policy.
while the idea has recently gained more support, drug tests aren't new and have also been tried in some parts of the united states. installing such facilities at music festivals has de facto been the norm in some european countries, including the netherlands and austria, for more than a decade. but amid more detailed research and increases in drug-related hospital admissions, supporters of drug tests are now also gaining momentum in australia and new zealand, where authorities have so far allowed only limited trials.

about a week later, bannon and priebus told mcfarland that the president wanted her to resign as deputy national security adviser, but they suggested that she could be appointed ambassador to singapore. at trump's direction, priebus asked mcfarland to put in writing that trump did not direct flynn to talk to kislyak. she refused, saying she did not know whether that was true. she consulted a white house lawyer for advice, who also urged her not to write the letter. he was concerned it could be seen as a quid pro quo for the ambassador position.

even as much of the economy bounces back, evictions could easily spike as protections fade away; millions of unemployed workers are severely behind on rent. and many services on which the poor and middle class depend could take a significant hit: public education and public transportation, in particular, could face drastic cuts as cities and towns search for ways to close budget gaps caused by reduced tax revenue and the high costs of fighting the coronavirus. the pain will linger for low-wage workers even as many economic headlines turn rosy again.
mary prahl, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at ucsf who works with gaw, said she would have liked to see a parallel clinical trial of the vaccines for pregnant women.
saying he was ready to toss in the towel, rumsfeld added: i don't think it is responsible to the american taxpayers to leave it like it is. we need a way forward. i've worked on it and worked on it. i am about to conclude that it is not possible for the u.s. government bureaucracy to do the only sensible thing.
for its part, blackrock felt the ofr report had not been prepared transparently, unhappy that it was granted just two meetings a year apart, to engage with the agency on the report, said a person familiar with the matter. the firm filed six letters with the securities and exchange commission commenting on the ofr report between november 2013 and may 2014. by comparison, its three biggest competitors in the asset management industry — vanguard, fidelity and state street — filed five letters total. the fallout over the report permanently damaged the ofr's reputation, several former officials said, and eroded its support in congress.

since 1992, democrats have run elections on a twin promise of cutting middle class taxes while making the rich pay their fair share. but since the passage of the 2017 tax cuts, there's a palpable willingness among democrats to talk about restoring higher taxes on the very wealthy, and perhaps even returning to rates abandoned decades ago. in iowa, warren suggested restoring the 50 percent estate tax on the very highest incomes, so that it would affect perhaps only the 10,000 wealthiest families in the country.

shortly after the intrusions were discovered last month, the national security council stood up a task force, the cyber unified coordination group, to coordinate the investigation and remediation of the incident.
republicans are likely to have a different view. the secure elections act, a bipartisan bill in the republican-controlled senate last session, didn't go nearly as far as this latest house bill and still never reached a floor vote. that bill basically punted on the question of paper ballots — leaving final security recommendations up to an independent advisory commission.
spygate and deflategate remain part of the legacies of brady, belichick and the patriots. those legacies will be debated forever and, at this point, it's unlikely that anyone's mind will be changed. either you believe that the patriots are cheaters, or you believe that the patriots are victims of jealous opponents attempting to sully their reputation after being unable to beat them on the field.
investors are awaiting friday's employment report. when the jobs report is strong, mortgage rates tend to rise.
plenty of that is going to happen behind the scenes, but we already know what many of the campaign benchmarks will be this year. the political calendar is slowly filling in, and the window for candidates to announce is fairly narrow; no one who went on to win his or her party's nomination in this century announced (or formed an exploratory committee) any later than april the year before the election.

a pharmacist and a number of physicians told me about older insulins available from walmart. the type of insulin first came out in the 1980s and now costs about $25 per vial. so-called walmart insulin is a controversial solution for type 1 diabetics, many of whom believe that older formulas are more likely to lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels. a few doctors echoed that concern. yet it could still save lives. it's very good insulin, one physician told me. another said, it's obviously better than nothing. researchers have found that these older insulins work just as well for type 2 diabetics as pricier analog insulins, but some research shows a slightly better outcome for type 1 diabetics on newer formulas.

— second thoughts on 2019 market forecasts. the wall street journal's michael wursthorn and akane otani: the market's roller-coaster ride has prompted some wall street analysts to cut their 2019 forecasts, the latest sign of unease as the stock bull market approaches its 10th year. major indexes rallied friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report boosted investors' confidence in the u.s. economy, and federal reserve chairman jerome powell suggested the central bank would be flexible with its policy plans.

enter birkhead, a 58-year-old former semipro football player who had headed the police forces of duke university and the nearby town of hillsborough. he cast himself as a representative of the county's inclusive values — a protector of everyone who's here, regardless of their immigration status — and he pledged not to cooperate with ice unless legally compelled. winning the trust of durham's latinos, he said, meant distancing himself from a federal agency known for tearing families apart.

vietnam depends on china for key materials and equipment to supply its factories. yet relations with its powerful neighbor -- the two countries fought a brief border war in 1979 -- are fraught and further inflamed because of competing territorial claims in the south china sea. (vietnam's coastline of about 3,400 kilometers, or 2,100 miles, follows one of the world's busiest sea cargo lanes.) vietnam favors greater u.s. economic and military presence in the region to counter china's growing might and is expected to push for a close relationship with the biden administration.

given the stakes — both for students and the budget — it is important for policymakers and the general public to understand the effects of different forgiveness options. many economists have already pointed out that loan forgiveness would disproportionately help people on the upper end of the earning scale: two scholars with the brookings institution, for instance, note that 60 percent of educational debt is owed by households in the top 40 percent of earners — those, that is, with an annual income of $74,000 or more. this skew is hardly surprising, as many americans do not go to college and only a fraction go to graduate or professional schools. and those who do go to college earn substantially more, in part thanks to the degree: over their lifetime, the median couple with two bachelor's degrees earns $1.8 million more than the median couple with two high school diplomas.

the electoral college has come under attack in recent years. the left characterizes the system as an antiquated, undemocratic method of selecting the president. in reality, our nation's founders designed this system as a compromise that takes into account a variety of competing concerns. the electoral college balanced a desire to allow individuals across the nation to vote for president while also ensuring that small states' voters would not be ignored.
third, the two parties' voters are different. the most interesting aspect of warren's launch video was how it diverged from the messaging of every recent democratic nominee for president. in 2016, republicans got behind a candidate who argued that there was no compromise with the political class and that a strong leader was needed to dismantle it. democrats have generally argued that good people can differ and unite against the minority of special interests keeping the government from answering voters' needs.

at the same time, these women ran as republican partisans and are entering an increasingly polarized congress. since each house of congress is controlled by narrow margins, republicans will probably want to differentiate themselves from democratic president-elect joe biden and a narrow house democratic majority, not to cooperate with them. this will reduce opportunities for legislating.
but they said the u.s. government failed to confront a more distressing reality — that it was responsible for fueling the corruption, by doling out vast sums of money with limited foresight or regard for the consequences.
the first overtime super bowl sparked some discussion about the overtime rule. the patriots won the coin flip, got the ball first in overtime and drove to the winning touchdown. game over. the atlanta falcons never got the ball.
pompeo boasts of support for ukraine: i issued the crimea declaration, which reversed the ban on lethal military assistance to ukraine. obama wouldn't send freedom fighters weapons. we did. no mention that trump held up aid to ukraine to force its government to smear his political opponent. pompeo was on the call with ukraine's president but did not object.

it would confound reason if the presidential results of these states were to face objection while the congressional results of the same process escaped public scrutiny, roy said. those representatives were elected through the very same systems – with the same ballot procedures, with the same signature validations, with the same broadly applied decisions of executive and judicial branch officials – as were the electors chosen for the president of the united states under the laws of those states.
karron would have liked to see toxicology studies known as dart studies, which focus on developmental and reproductive risks, completed earlier. the resulting information along with initial safety data from nonpregnant individuals in clinical trials could then have been reviewed by experts to determine how and when the vaccines should be formally evaluated in pregnant women.
at that point, widman was introduced to richard schroeder, a cia officer stationed in munich to manage the agency's involvement in crypto. widman would later claim to agency historians that his world fell apart completely in that moment.
for two decades, germany has been a leader in pressing other nations to curb carbon output and shift to renewable energy. though it is falling short of its ambitious goals, germany has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions this year by 40 percent compared to 1990 — and by up to 95 percent by mid-century.
for conti, the boston university economist, the administration's blueprint doesn't go far enough in addressing insurers. to guarantee that real people pay lower prices at the pharmacy, the first thing she would do is eliminate insurance plans that allow large out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs — including the kind of high-deductible plan that alec opted not to take. it's insurance principles 101, conti says. people should not have to pay significant high prices for accessing a treatment that keeps them well.
over the past two decades, public opinion has swung dramatically toward decriminalizing pot. a survey conducted in october by the pew research center found that 61 percent of u.s. adults support marijuana legalization, which is nearly double the percentage favoring it in 2000. among republicans overall, 43 percent were in favor — although that number reached 62 percent among gop-leaning voters younger than 40.
the alleged actions, which have been denied by greitens' lawyer, stem from a report by kmov in st. louis which featured a surreptitious recording purportedly of the woman with whom greitens acknowledges having an affair in 2015. she describes greitens inviting her to his home and taking pictures of her naked and then threatening to use them against her if she ever mentioned their relationship.
the past decade shifted our view of global politics. long gone is any certainty in the inexorability of liberal democracy — single-party states still flourish, while demagogic populism and far-right nationalism are powerful forces within many of the world's major democracies. rights groups warn of the erosion of once-healthy democracies and new threats to freedom and privacy posed by government cyber surveillance.

loeffler campaigned with qanon adherents and ran a commercial that described her as more conservative than attila the hun. she also coupled her fate completely with trump's, boasting at every stop that she supports him 100 percent of the time. this week, loeffler even announced plans to vote against certifying the presidential results from her own state in a bid to placate trump.

the survey by polling firm yougov showed that if a referendum were held immediately, 46 percent would vote to remain, 39 percent would vote to leave, and the rest either did not know, would not vote, or refused to answer the question. when the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favor of remaining. that is broadly in line with other polls in recent months which show a deeply divided electorate, in which opinion has swung slightly towards remaining in the eu.

since the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. a variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.
president trump said jan. 6 that he may declare a national emergency to get funding for his border wall depending on how negotiations develop. (ap)
the democrats could revive their deal from last year that would have exchanged $25 billion toward a border wall for a path to citizenship for dreamers. trump initially signaled interest but was talked out of it by the hard-line anti-immigration people around him. that deal is probably looking pretty good right about now to trump. it could also appeal to democrats, who have made protecting dreamers a priority, but committing $25 billion is a huge leap from the $5.7 billion they are refusing now.
beginning in 2006, the dea went after drug distributors and pharmacies for failing to report suspicious orders of millions of opioid pills that spilled into the black market. over the next decade, the dea brought two dozen enforcement cases and forced the companies to pay $500 million in fines.
the weeks since the deaths have provided some clues, but much remains murky. fairfax county police have not released a motive, and ayaz's husband, the sole surviving member of the immediate family, said he is not ready to talk and has not shared key details with noera's relatives.
shanahan said in a tweet early wednesday evening that his top priority is ensuring the defense department is lethal and agile. he has met with senior leaders and his policy team, and his focus remains on the national defense strategy, in which mattis last year called for the pentagon to prepare for threats posed by adversaries such as russia and china, he wrote.
so far, trump appears to be leaning heavily on secretary of state mike pompeo for guidance on the decision to target soleimani and the strike's aftermath, as well as making the public case that the operation was warranted.
i would argue that this is a triumph of democracy, kelly said via skype. scandals happen all the time. the question is how do democracies respond to those scandals?
and though a debate question tuesday night sought to tie sanders's potential to be the first jewish president to his decision to skip the american israel public affairs committee's annual conference, the connection was strained (which sanders seemed to realize; after noting that he is very proud of being jewish, he quickly pivoted to a broader critique of u.s. middle east policy).
the korea centers for disease control and prevention has a much greater capability for testing than japan and can administer around 20,000 tests a day — one possible reason it has found so many cases.

the neighborhood group in question, the carrington community association, is composed of homeowners in an upscale subdivision in fairfax county. the community abuts the mclean islamic center, a mosque with about 100 members. early last year, the mosque (known as mic) sought to expand its morning prayer service; it asked the county to lift a cap that had restricted attendance to just 10 people.

after the bnd's departure, the cia expanded its clandestine collection of companies in the encryption sector, according to former western intelligence officials. using cash amassed from the crypto operation, the agency secretly acquired a second firm and propped up a third. the documents do not disclose any details about these entities. but the bnd history notes that one of crypto's longtime rivals — gretag ag, also based in switzerland — was taken over by an 'american' and, after a change of names in 2004, was liquidated.
no, what's amazing is that texas has gone a so-so 78-60 across 11 seasons with all that money, which is humorous if you can refrain from sobbing. and what's really amazing is thinking back to monday, oct. 12, 2015, surveying the landscape of that day, and then realizing that five years and change later, steve sarkisian would replace tom herman at texas.

as he has done on so many different topics, trump has taken what others had implied and made it explicit. while republicans built an alternative media apparatus on the notion that the mainstream media are hopelessly biased against them, trump said outright that any story that didn't offer him the praise he felt he deserved was literally fake news. for trump, reality is a joke and lying is as reflexive as breathing, and the war on the media hasn't been just about creating an alternate reality. it also involves relentless, angry, bitter, petty attacks on anyone who questions him. one of the consequences is that he has forced reporters to change how they operate — in ways that don't help him.
this bill will bring much-needed clarity to critical provisions of the controlled substances act. in doing so, we will ensure that the dea's authorities are not abused and threatened by future legal challenges; foster greater collaboration, communication and transparency between the dea and the supply chain; create more opportunities to identify bad actors at the end of the supply chain; and, most importantly, be certain that prescriptions are accessible to patients in need.
how can this be? it's true that bolivia has been on the receiving end of a staggering boom in natural resources for much of the past decade, as both the volume of its gas and mining exports and the price they fetch abroad jumped at the same time. export revenue grew six-fold in the decade after evo morales, the charismatic hard-left president, took power, from $2.2 billion just before of his election to $12.9 billion at the peak of the boom.

jim lyons, who served as interior's deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management under the obama administration, said in an interview that revoking these policies will undermine the kind of landscape-scale conservation espoused by scientists and many policymakers.
liberalized trade treaties have made it possible for blackstone-owned firms such as freescale semiconductor and trw auto parts to lower costs by moving work to low-wage countries overseas. the same treaties have also made it possible for blackstone to attract more foreign investors, like the sovereign wealth funds of china and saudi arabia, while opening new investment opportunities for blackstone abroad, such as legoland and versace.

the post's calculation reflects 703,000 pending appeals across the country and 529,000 people waiting on a benefits decision in the states that publicly share that information or that responded to a request for comment, alyssa fowers and heather long report. people's claims have been held up for months at times for something as simple as a typo or uploading a scan of a driver's license instead of a photo. most delays are the result of three key factors: extensive fraud prevention checks, antiquated computer systems and applications being flagged for extra scrutiny. claims set aside for manual review often take months to resolve. the holdup in sending out unemployment aid has caused families to fall severely behind on rent, cancel medical treatments and struggle to buy food, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have yet to receive any money despite applying for unemployment in the spring or summer.
there are any number of complicating factors that undergird this, of course: the willingness of either party to compromise, the willingness of a president to forge bipartisan agreements, the strength of either party's majority in the house and the senate. the most recent congress had a very narrow republican majority and a fractured republican caucus in the house, which, combined with president trump's generally lackadaisical approach to policy, certainly didn't help things move forward.

the president put his support behind a more conservative bill that would have amended loopholes in immigration law, allowing the administration to detain families for longer periods and speed up the huge backlog of asylum cases. but that plan, which also included massive cuts to legal immigration programs, was soundly defeated, as democrats opposed rolling back protections for immigrant families.
2. kurdish forces in syria said sunday that they had captured two american citizens hiding out in the country's final islamic state stronghold, per louisa loveluck and erin cunningham. in a statement, the syrian democratic forces, or sdf, identified the detainees as warren christopher clark, 34, and zaid abed al-hamid, 35. … in a sign of how far some of the group's members had traveled as their battlefields shrank, the sdf said sunday that clark and hamid had been captured hundreds of miles from mosul, in the hajin area of eastern syria. … clark was a texas resident and worked as a substitute teacher in the houston area before traveling to saudi arabia and turkey to teach english … he reportedly converted to islam in 2004 and later became radicalized online.

after 5 1/2 years, i will hand over the reins of the daily 202 later this month to olivier knox, a veteran political reporter and broadcast journalist, to start my next job as a columnist for the opinions section. knox has covered every presidential campaign and administration in the last 20 years. he joins the post from siriusxm, where he was chief washington correspondent and hosted a live, three-hour show each weeknight focused on politics, foreign policy, and the federal government. before that, he reported for yahoo news and hosted a weekly yahoo-branded radio show. knox got his start as a reporter at agence france-presse, for which he covered eight years of the george w. bush administration. he served as president of the white house correspondents' association from july 2018 to july 2019.
his op-ed seems, in part, to be an effort to explain his many about-faces. in the piece, romney emphasized twice that he's particularly appalled by this past month of trump's presidency. this may be true, but it's also an extremely convenient line. after all, trump's cabinet has been trending toward less-experienced yes-men for a long time, a phenomenon that accelerated after the 2018 election. trump's character has been pretty consistent throughout. romney's point about trump and the damage to u.s. alliances is also something you could have said for much of the past two years.

(in the united states, all cases were tested at the headquarters of the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta until wednesday, when test kits were sent to more than 100 state labs.)

moreover, at least in a system where subnational governmments must raise a large proportion of their own funding, they do in fact have strong incentives to adopt policies that attract foot voting taxpayers and businesses. otherwise, they risk losing valuable tax revenue that can be spent on projects they value, or on efforts to help keep them in power. additional tax revenue is valuable to officials even if voters remain poorly informed and do not directly reward them for it. if nothing else, it can be useful in enriching the officials themselves and their political allies. thus, competition can incentivize local and regional governments to cater to the needs of foot voters, even in the absence of electoral pressure to do so.
inman said the operation also put him in one of the trickiest binds he'd encountered in government service. at one point, the nsa intercepted libyan communications indicating that the president's brother, billy carter, was advancing libya's interests in washington and was on leader moammar gaddafi's payroll.
that is why, they said, his speech included another aim: if necessary, to seriously damage the serbian military's capacity to harm the people of kosovo. even if there were political support for using ground troops, the option is hardly more appealing to the white house. clinton, sources said, is being advised by his national security advisers that inserting ground troops would be a virtually certain recipe for a costly, open-ended commitment in kosovo and, possibly, all of yugoslavia. invade, occupy and stay there, one senior administration official said of what would happen if nato troops go to kosovo. you own this country. the thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into a hostile situation, into kosovo and into the balkans, is the prospect of never being able to get them out, clinton told cbs's dan rather in an interview televised last night. as the administration decides what to do next, it must also fend off a we-told-you-so debate within its own ranks. while white house officials said they always contemplated the possibility of a serb assault, several people familiar with nato planning said what has unfolded is decisively on the worst-case end of the spectrum. we underestimated the ferocity and velocity of [serbian president slobodan] milosevic's offensive to transform the ethnic balance in kosovo, said a senior nato military source. a political-military plan prepared in october envisioned that milosevic might accelerate ethnic cleansing, but also that he might yield quickly once force was applied, said one former administration official familiar with the planning.
macmillan, who memorialized his vaccination on tiktok, said, maybe if there was more time, i would've said, 'isn't there someone who needs this more than me?' 
klaus schwab, founder and executive chairman of the forum, thanked trump for injecting optimism into the discussion.
the point: if republicans knocked off every democrat from a red-tinted district who voted for pelosi today, and reelected every one of their incumbents, they'd come out of 2020 with a majority. but the map isn't that simple.

under that reasoning, according to experts, policymakers vetting a proposed coal mine or oil drilling operation would not have to consider whether burning those fossil fuels later on will contribute to climate change. federal judges have ruled multiple times that the government needs to account for both the construction of those operations and the emissions that later result.
you see it when daughters support universal health care only after their fathers are diagnosed with cancer, or when fathers support access to abortion only when their daughters need one.
the united states will not hesitate to nullify the agreement, esper said at a ceremony with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg and afghan president ashraf ghani that was held at the same time as the signing in doha.
the already extant business uncertainty caused by past short-term funding agreements and sequestration will be exacerbated by this current shutdown. bobbie kilberg, chief executive of the northern virginia technology council, pointed to the many members of her group doing business with the federal government that would lose revenue in the near term and have a difficult time planning for future growth. since our region's government contractors receive approximately $1.3 billion in revenue each week from federal government procurement, a shutdown or the unpredictability of short-term spending deals are equally reason for concern.

flynn then told other trump advisers, including vice president-elect mike pence, that he had not discussed sanctions with kislyak.
despite trump's renewed calls for a border wall, republicans remain frayed over how to move forward. some moderates are willing to either pass a bill giving dreamers a path to citizenship or craft a deal with democrats that would include some border security measures. but the bulk of the conservative rank-and-file want more in exchange for accepting an immigration policy that much of the republican base opposes.
between 2008 and 2011, the dea had launched a half-dozen pain-clinic investigations involving drug distributors, including cardinal for a second time, and one manufacturer, mallinckrodt, the largest producer of generic opioids. the dea hit them with inspection warrants, subpoenaed internal corporate records and issued orders to show cause as well as immediate suspension orders.
and a leading immigration hardliner, who has been a close ally of white house aide stephen miller, warned that the georgia results could undermine trump's hope for a comeback in 2024:
as she's gotten older, it's near-impossible to get her into anything without an image of animals, sports or superheroes. and this is where, every time she outgrows another size, things get ugly.
fauci said there was scientific interest in the possibility that two half-doses of the moderna vaccine might be effective in adults ages 18 to 55 based on evidence from an early clinical trial in which a subset of people received half a dose and had similar immune responses as the group given the full dose.
the protection of conscience is a freedom that for too long has not been given the attention it deserves, severino said friday.
industry officials defended the new law as an effort to ensure that legitimate pain patients receive their medication without disruption. the industry had long complained that federal prescription drug laws were too vague about the responsibility of companies to report suspicious orders of narcotics. the industry also complained that the dea communicated poorly with companies — citing a 2015 report by the government accountability office — and was too punitive when narcotics were diverted out of the legal drug distribution chain.
-- moreover, the u.s.-led coalition appears to have ramped up active military operations in the wake of trump's announcement. between december 16 and december 29, us-led coalition military forces conducted 469 air and artillery strikes targeting isis in syria, cnn reports. the strikes were carried out against isis fighters, buildings, oil facilities, vehicles, tunnels, weapons caches and improvised explosive device facilities … prior to that period the coalition had been averaging about 200 strikes per week in syria as fighting around the isis-held town of hajin ramped up.

buehler was finally released nine months later after crypto agreed to pay the iranians $1 million, a sum that was secretly provided by the bnd, according to the documents. the cia refused to chip in, citing the u.s. policy against succumbing to ransom demands for hostages.
but that last quote betrays bloomberg's biggest liability here. it's one thing for the policy to have the consequence of targeting minorities; it's another for him to acknowledge that's what it was doing and to say it was justified for that specific reason.
all the falcons had to do to get a possession in overtime was to hold the patriots to a field goal. or to no points at all. once the falcons failed to do that, they no longer deserved to win.

there are t1international activists like hattie saltzman, a college student in missouri who went a year without buying insulin because she couldn't afford her monthly $550 insulin bill. her father shared some of his insulin, and she got free samples from her doctor. at one point, she told me, i had rationed insulin so extensively that it expired. i didn't catch that until i went to the er because my blood sugars were through the roof. when the diabetic daughter of family friends died of cystic fibrosis, the family donated her leftover insulin to saltzman. that got her through the year until she qualified for better insurance coverage.

prisons are not self-contained units. prisoner transfers and releases spread the virus. corrections staff carry it between the inside and outside. especially, large prisons drove up local infection rates over the summer, as a recent prison policy initiative report indicates. but now the virus is spreading much faster and more widely. deaths of people in prison rarely make the news. the body count piles up but hardly registers with the public — or apparently in governors' offices.

barnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down washington pressure group. the society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. no one at federalist society headquarters in washington dictated barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. it's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the federalist society that barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and barnett took it from there. multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the federalist society's true source of power.

the march — which typically draws busloads of catholic school students, a large contingent of evangelical christians and poster-toting protesters of many persuasions — falls each year around the anniversary of the 1973 roe v. wade decision that recognized a legal right to abortion, and it intends to pressure congress and the white house to limit legal access to the procedure.
there are many in iraq who would like to salvage the u.s. presence, said michael knights of the washington institute of near east policy. he noted that the vote in parliament was conducted in the absence of sunni and kurdish members, by a show of hands that did not provide evidence of overwhelming majority support for a departure of u.s. forces.

initial estimates suggest that the virus could be 50 to 70 percent more transmissible, although there's still much that we don't know about the new variant. it could turn out that the transmissibility has been overstated and that the dominance of the virus in the u.k. is due to chance or changed behavior among people.
warnock is fond of telling crowds that jesus healed the sick, even those with preexisting conditions. he wants college to be cheaper because he went to morehouse on the full faith scholarship which means he didn't have enough money for the first semester. it works on multiple levels. if you are a progressive hoping for the same policy outcomes, warnock is speaking your language. if you want someone who understands your culture because he comes from where you come from, that works, too.

south africa has also identified another new strain of the coronavirus that also appears to be more transmissible. britain's health minister matt hancock told bbc radio 4's today program that this variant could be even more of a problem than the uk new variant. the south africa variant has additional mutations to the virus's spike protein, sparking concerns that existing vaccines may not be as effective against it. john bell, a professor of medicine at the university of oxford and a member of britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.

polyannas will try to deny this, but look at the facts: most major european economies are stagnant and reeling from the pandemic. their governments were debt-ridden before the pandemic and have borrowed tens of billions of dollars since to keep afloat. china has the cash to splash on strategic investments that will employ millions of europeans and perhaps even to purchase government bonds and directly finance government deficits. a debt-ridden united states is not in the economic position to displace chinese influence-buying.

she is not bernie sanders. plenty of the democrats who wanted to draft warren into the 2016 race went on to support the vermont senator; a good number of those strategists, activists and voters now support him even with warren in the race. but warren's approach to campaigning could not be more different. the sanders approach, which has not changed in decades, is to sketch out a social democratic vision of america — universal health care, free public college tuition, a $15 minimum wage — in sentences punctuated by applause. he mentions his biography only to talk about how he proved skeptics wrong as mayor of burlington. voters who show up to hear sanders hear the message, and then they decide whether they're in.

the redskins claimed foster off waivers after he was arrested in tampa on nov. 24. it was his second arrest for domestic violence in 2018, and while those first charges, filed in california, were also dropped, the niners released him the morning after the second incident. two days later, washington was the only team to put in a waiver claim for foster. the nfl immediately placed him on the commissioner's exempt list while the league conducted an investigation into the florida arrest. the nfl's personal conduct policy empowers the league to discipline a player without a criminal charge if it believes such measures are warranted.
mcchrystal was forced to resign in 2010 after making disparaging comments about obama administration officials in a rolling stone article. he had been a rising star in the army, a decorated expert on counterinsurgency tasked with turning around the stalemated afghanistan war.
some companies are beginning to understand the untapped value of workers with disabilities. microsoft has a dedicated website for job-seekers with disabilities to learn about the company's hiring practices and accommodations. procter & gamble, deloitte, jpmorgan chase, ford and other giants have neurodiversity hiring initiatives to seek employees with neurological differences, such as autism, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
the north korean leader's test — after test, after test, after test, after test — of ballistic missiles has put the world on edge; so has president trump's threats in response. gold is one of those places people flee when they worry that things may get messy.
consider an analogy. it is doubtless the case that golfers with long swings such as phil mickelson hit the ball farther and more accurately than golfers with short swings like myself. an index of swing length would be highly correlated with almost any measure of golf performance. does this mean i should lengthen my swing? i doubt it. those with more flexibility and coordination are able to take and control longer swings and play golf better. if i were to try to swing like mickelson, i would mishit the ball and maybe break my back.
under the concept of disparate impact, actions can amount to discrimination if they have an uneven effect even if that was not the intent, and rolling back this approach has been a longtime goal of conservative legal thinkers. past republican administrations have done little to erode the concept's application, partly out of concerns that the supreme court might disagree, or that such changes would be unpopular and viewed as racist.

in their push to sell off our lands to the fossil fuel industry, the trump administration has engaged in a corrupt process and disrespected and dismissed the indigenous people, said bernadette demientieff, executive director of the gwich'in steering committee. we will continue to fight this illegal sale in court, and we call on president-elect biden to act immediately to protect our lands from destructive drilling once and for all.

the document describes the effort as a digital messaging operation to influence the outcome of the al senate race by targeting 650,000 likely voters with messages on social media platforms such as facebook, while obscuring the fact that the messages were coming from an effort backing jones. jones has said he had no knowledge of project birmingham and has called for a federal investigation.
they would agree on modifications and work up new encryption schemes. then widman would deliver the blueprints to crypto engineers. the cia history calls him the irreplaceable man, and the most important recruitment in the history of the minerva program.
before the meeting began saturday morning, trump took a combative tone in several twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.
over the course of the war, u.s. military officials have made distinctions in their appraisal of the afghan security forces. despite its problems, there is a consensus that the army has made strides and earned a measure of respect from the afghan public. elite special-operations units often receive praise for their combat effectiveness.

for the first time in decades, the house of representatives opened a new session with one vacant seat — the 9th district of north carolina. mark harris, the republican who declared victory in that race in november, spent thursday filing a motion in wake county superior court, asking to be certified as a member of congress.
in the longer term, democratic control of the senate would have a major effect on judicial nominations, as republicans, led by majority leader mitch mcconnell (ky.), have demonstrated during both the obama and trump presidencies.
the 1969 stonewall uprising against police harassment at a greenwich village bar is widely cited as the catalyst for the gay rights movement. but a proper understanding of the struggle for equality must include the activism that began a decade earlier in washington, d.c., where the federal government's discrimination against gay and lesbian americans compelled a small number of heroic men and women to organize and lobby for their rights.
for resolving a complex and difficult issue like the generations- [and] even centuries-long conflict like this, strong leadership is needed, vucic said in an interview. the participation of great powers with influence in the region is a must. as the leader of one of world's great nations, one with deep involvement in the region, i am sure president trump could make an important contribution to resolving this conflict.

in south carolina, miracle hill was expecting to have been given the okay by now. trump administration officials have signaled they are sympathetic to its cause, yet the decision has been pending for months.
the organization is launching with a single reporter in the field, errin haines, who previously covered race and ethnicity for the associated press. she will cover the 2020 race. a bare-bones site is launching monday. until 19thnews.org is fully built later this year, the 19th's articles will publish on the washington post's website.
under the 25th amendment, the president can be removed from office by the vice president plus a majority of the cabinet, or by the vice president and a body established by congress, if they determine he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
by any measure, the drama that simonds has endured since november is not what she is accustomed to as a yoga-practicing mother of two daughters. an ohio native, she moved to newport news in 2000 when her husband, paul, an engineer, got a job at nasa.
of course, republican leaders didn't always or uniformly tolerate gonzo conspiracy theories. presidential nominee john mccain, for instance, contradicted one of his supporters at a 2008 campaign event, telling her that barack obama was not, in fact, an arab. onetime senator and 1996 presidential hopeful arlen specter (pa.) also stuck up for the truth when he assailed two leading gop conspiracy theorists, robertson and pat buchanan, as leaders of the intolerant right.
rivalry between qatar and its neighbors gas extended beyond the persian gulf. the countries find themselves on either side of a proxy war in libya. qatar has drawn closer to turkey, which helped it weather the initial shock of the embargo. meanwhile, turkey's ties to other gulf states have soured; for example, the country has deployed troops to fight against uae-backed forces in libya, and it released information implicating saudi agents in the 2018 murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi in istanbul.
further, holly mccammon's research on the suffrage movement finds that local organizing generally diversified the movement, decentralized decision-making, and spurred conflict among movement leaders — which led to more effective and innovative tactics.
this isn't what cruz's lawyerly statement actually said, nor is it what he said during the appearance on fox news that apparently inspired the tweet. instead, he touted the unprecedented allegations of fraud, most of which stem from trump. but such nuances are secondary to both parties. trump got to tout an ally in his fight and cruz got trump's approval — even as he preserved the long-term deniability that his comments have been carefully intended to maintain.
the coronavirus epidemic is already exposing weaknesses in the health services of the countries it affects.
the rule springs from safety concerns. lithium metal and lithium ion/polymer batteries are susceptible to emitting smoke, catching fire and even exploding. between march 1991 and may 2017, the federal aviation administration documented 160 incidents involving lithium batteries that were being transported as cargo or baggage. the agency already prohibits passengers from checking spare lithium batteries used for personal electronic devices and portable rechargers, as well as several lithium-powered items such as e-cigarettes and vape pens. the faa permits the items inside the cabin.

feb. 17, 2019, issue: if you're looking across the pond for relief from the political discord, try again. the united kingdom is roiled by brexit, its parliament remains at loggerheads about how to proceed, and confidence in prime minister theresa may is hanging on by a thread. for artist adriana bellet, the spectacle is personal: as a spanish woman married to a british man and living in sweden, brexit is not only troubling but downright tragic, she says. for me the worst is the disappearance of a britain that was warm and welcoming, that took me in and taught me how to be an adult.

on nov. 13, he floated the idea that the country might go into a lockdown. but it was a clear reference to biden, because trump explicitly ruled out his own administration doing that.

whether either or both of these governors can mount a viable campaign remains to be seen, but their presence in the race would provide a much-needed emphasis on practicality and competence. trump, who cannot keep the government open with republican majorities in both houses, could enter 2020 with a faltering economy, a massive debt, a health-care system hobbled by his own machinations and a ridiculous energy policy based on fantasies like clean coal. a competent governor from the center-left might be a welcome alternative to president chaos.

people may hate the open office design — and there are plenty of reasons to, including their stifling of collaboration and the incessant noise and lack of concentration — but it's probably here to stay, albeit with design tweaks around the edges: more small conference rooms and collaboration areas for people to find some privacy or host a meeting. furniture designs that allow people to put up barriers around their desk.

in 1982, the reagan administration took advantage of argentina's reliance on crypto equipment, funneling intelligence to britain during the two countries' brief war over the falkland islands, according to the cia history, which doesn't provide any detail on what kind of information was passed to london. the documents generally discuss intelligence gleaned from the operation in broad terms and provide few insights into how it was used.

the president's online and offline rhetoric ultimately emboldened a supportive mob later to breach the building, halting the house and senate's work and forcing pence's evacuation. the president soon returned to twitter to encourage his supporters to stay peaceful — but he did not ask them to leave until he did so in a video uploaded to the site later in the afternoon.

on feb. 9, the washington post broke the news that flynn had in fact discussed sanctions with kislyak before trump took office, despite the denials from the vice president and top trump aides.
given the changes that the previous year has had on my professional and personal life, i do not expect my daily life to ever feel similar to pre-pandemic times. more broadly though and given the disappointingly slow roll out of the vaccine to the vulnerable in many states, i anticipate that american society will start to feel more like normal by april 2021.
tipping is a difficult topic. it's a vestige of reconstruction-era discrimination that, according to study after study, perpetuates racism, sexism and ageism in dining rooms. but restaurant owners are loath to raise menu prices to the point where tipping isn't necessary to pay staff a real wage, because customers have become used to low, tip-subsidized prices. some customers seem to really enjoy the feeling of power they have over restaurant and bar workers, mentally dinging percentage points off a tip if the steak isn't medium-rare or the wine glasses aren't topped up every time.
here's one example: more than 1 million children have one or both parents in prison. these are the forgotten children, almost six times more likely to go to prison themselves. and they should not be punished for the sins of their fathers. we should give grants to ministries and mentoring programs that offer support and love and concern for these children. let us bring hope and help to these other innocent victims of crime. i'm not calling for government to step back from its responsibilities, but to share in them. we'll always need government to raise and distribute funds, to monitor success and set standards. but we also need what no government can provide, the power of compassion and prayer and love. (applause) these are some of my goals for america to help make opportunity not only a hope and a promise, but a living reality. the naacp and the gop have not always been allies. i know that. but recognizing our past and confronting the future with a common vision, by doing that, i believe we can find common ground. it won't be easy work, but a philosopher once advised, when given a choice, prefer the hard. we will prefer the hard, because only the hard will achieve the good. that's my commitment, and that is our opportunity. thank you for having me, and god bless america.

though trump said friday that americans are more and more pro-life; you see that all the time, views on abortion have remained quite steady for decades. since the mid-1990s, about half of citizens, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases.

the industry has attracted thousands of young people in recent years with the promise of secure careers as shale drilling took off and made the united states the world's largest producer of oil. but many students and recent graduates say they are no longer sure that there is a place for them in the industry, according to the new york times. even after the pandemic ends, some of them fear that growing concerns about climate change will lead to the inevitable decline of oil and gas.
it's hard to imagine what legitimate public interest lies in killing efforts to promote financial literacy. but in the con-man economy, maybe public interest is no longer a consideration.
another major issue regulators were examining in the years after the financial crisis was what kinds of new rules to institute for money-market funds, which are not guaranteed by the federal government like regular bank accounts but which still typically serve as risk-free places for investors to store cash. they are run by asset managers such as blackrock.
trump issued a statement overnight once biden was certified the winner, the product of considerable discussion with some of his advisers. it read: even though i totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on january 20th. i have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. while this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to make america great again.
he noted that the turnout for early voting for the special election, an option overwhelmingly picked by democrats in november's presidential race, has been low. as of monday, about 850 had voted early in a district of nearly 51,000 active voters.

trump learned about pierson's remarks from rep. devin nunes (calif.), the committee's ranking republican and a staunch trump ally, said one person familiar with the matter. trump's suspicions of the intelligence community have often been fueled by nunes, who was with the president in california on wednesday when he announced on twitter that grenell would become the acting director, officials said.

-- nancy pelosi downplayed the possibility that house democrats would attempt to impeach trump without bipartisan support to do so after hearing the findings from robert mueller's investigation. brian fung reports: democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without republican backing, pelosi hinted. that could hinge significantly on whether mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. 'if and when the time comes for impeachment,' she said, 'it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way.' pelosi's remarks were echoed sunday by house majority leader steny h. hoyer (d-md.), who said calls for trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from democrats' 'substantive agenda.'
as the special counsel announced new indictments and guilty pleas from trump's closest allies and associates, it's clear that the threat to the mueller investigation will only grow stronger, judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler (d-n.y.) wrote in a statement with reps. sheila jackson lee (d-tex.) and steve cohen (d-tenn.). now is the time for congress to finally act and pass this legislation to protect the integrity of the special counsel's investigation and the rule of law.
whether trump leaves the white house on his own or has to be dragged out of the building by federal agents, republicans are going to have to come to terms with the shambles that they and he have made of their supposedly conservative values.
even the use of legislative/administrative history, in its most expansive form, looks only at the actual process – and not the personal background of the legislators, let alone before they took office. as the 9th circuit itself put it in a discrimination case, statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself do not prove a discriminatory motive. mcginest v. gte serv. corp., 360 f.3d 1103, 1138 (9th cir. 2004).
mobile phones are common in afghanistan, and the interior ministry eventually set up a pilot program to pay a small number of police officers with mobile-phone credits. u.s. officials said the experiment worked well, but the afghan government did not implement it widely.

historically, more-moderate democrats have prevailed in virginia, including gov. ralph northam in 2017 and former governor terry mcauliffe in 2013.
like sanders, who may end up joining the race, warren simply does not use the language of compromise or national unity; she uses the language of resistance. as they pile into the race, some democrats will find themselves arguing for a return to the less divisive politics of the pre-trump era, while others, such as warren, will call for a president to dismantle the financial forces that made trump's win possible. to those in the latter camp, trump never could have won had he not been able to define himself as a blue-collar billionaire against clinton's wall street supporters; for them, in 2020, the job will be giving him an opponent who can make a populist case against him.

thunberg was quick to respond, updating her twitter biography to describe herself as a teenager working on her anger management problem.
biden and the democrats can thank trump in part for what is happening in georgia. the president, in denial over his election defeat, did everything imaginable to cloud and disrupt the senate runoffs with his repeated claims that the state, along with several others, had been stolen from him in november.
in his first year in office, trump railed against international agreements, pulled the united states out of trade pacts and climate deals and pushed an america first agenda. it's a surprise, too, because the forum is filled with journalists, celebrities and chief executives — exactly the kind of coastal elites trump has criticized. (one of his 2016 campaign ads featured a shot of financier and philanthropist george soros speaking at davos as an example of the global power structure crushing the american worker.)
trump said he was really proud to be the first president to stand with you here at the white house; ronald reagan and george w. bush addressed the march by telephone when they were in office.

cuomo's administration, working with state attorney general eric schneiderman, is exploring a number of legal challenges. they could include arguments that the gop plan violates the 10th and 14th amendments to the constitution.
trump has made more than 7,000 false claims as president, and to the extent his base of support processes those false claims, it has essentially dismissed them as unimportant in the scheme of things. most recently, this has taken the form of saying or suggesting terrorists are flooding the u.s.-mexico border, despite trump's own state department saying there is no evidence that even one has crossed. trump's base would probably argue that this stat is nitpicking — that it's unimportant since his underlying goal to build the border wall and protect the american people is morally right. but the fact remains that this claim leads to a badly skewed sense of the actual dangers americans face and could lead to a misplacement of priorities.
quite frankly, gov. scott called me and [also] expressed in writing a desire to have a meeting, he said. that meeting was the first in what i believe will be a series of conversations with other governors, the secretary said. i will no doubt talk to every governor. it doesn't matter to me whether you're republican or democrat. this is going to be a long process. this is going to be at least a year with public comment. we have to get it right, look at the geology, look at the science.
terrain's handel says that in most climates, the fiber coir, which is made from the husk of a coconut, is best for exterior doormats that are exposed to the weather. the thicker and scratchier the doormat you can find, the better, she says, for scraping off dirt. she prefers a knot-patterned weave doormat for its classic look. these can be found almost everywhere, including home depot, which has the entryways knot-ical handwoven coconut-fiber doormat ($38.57, homedepot.com).

but with lackluster oil prices and an increasing number of banks saying they would not finance arctic energy projects, major oil companies did not try to buy the leases. that left the state agency, alaska industrial development and export authority, as the main bidder. the agency put up all but two of the winning bids, which went to a couple of small energy firms.
bill kristol, who once served as dan quayle's chief of staff, underscored the odd nature of vice president pence taking meetings with congressional staffers on shutdown negotiations:
the problem confronting everyone in the west is that we aren't even talking about this stuff. moral choices are unavoidable. we need to understand them, discuss them as a society and come to conclusions. then we need to apply the science to those choices. western institutions have so far proved wholly unable to stage such a public discussion.

trump framed his decision to pull u.s. troops out as the fulfillment of a campaign promise. the president was a longtime critic of the barack obama administration's policy on fighting the islamic state in syria, writing in 2013 that the united states should stay the hell out of syria.

in the meantime, a portion of the more than 7 million diabetic americans who take insulin are stuck with debilitating costs. though most don't pay the full list price for insulin because of insurance coverage and other rebates, some do, especially those who are uninsured, underinsured or facing a coverage gap through medicare. the most vulnerable patients are subsidizing the system, william cefalu, the chief scientific, medical and mission officer of the american diabetes association, told a senate committee in may.

but standardized time can be, and has been, used against us. whether you get more out of clock time than it gets out of you is largely a function of your economic security. almost 90 years after john maynard keynes's prediction that the future would hold 15-hour workweeks and lives of leisure, we feel increasingly time-starved. sociologist judy wajcman, in her book pressed for time, calls this the time-pressure paradox: standardized time — in which dst is an archaic wrinkle — contributes to a world of labor-saving innovations. but the time they free up is immediately filled by demands for more work, and greater and more varied demands on our attention.
alec's funeral was held the day after the fourth of july, his favorite holiday. family and friends gathered at his parents' house in richfield, a minneapolis suburb, to shoot off fireworks in his memory. those first few weeks were a blur, as nicole tried in her grief to piece together the last days of alec's life. the medical examiner had listed diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) as the cause of death. by definition, he had died of a lack of insulin, but why and how did that happen?

a second-round pick in 2014, garoppolo rarely got off the bench in his first two seasons, but he shone in two starts this season when tom brady was serving his deflategate suspension. the 25-year-old completed 68.3 of his passes for 502 yards, four touchdowns, zero interceptions and a 113.3 rating, showing impressive decision-making and pocket presence.
that was the expression on stephon gilmore's face when asked about espn's report that brady, coach bill belichick and owner robert kraft no longer get along, and the franchise is coming apart from the force of their egos. gilmore paused in his gray sweats in the center of a swarm of reporters and actually said, what report?
all of this is being considered amid a pandemic that has exposed trump's white house as inept and dangerously disengaged, tested the wherewithal of state and local leadership, and strained the resolve of average americans. but covid-19 also affords biden an opportunity to demonstrate how the federal government can promote economic progress and healing.

slaoui went on to say that discussions were ongoing between regulators and moderna about a two-dose regimen of half doses. but the agency's statement rebutted that idea, specifying that changes such as reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, using a half dose instead of a full dose, or mixing and matching vaccines to immunize more people would not be supported by the current evidence.
blackrock's main position has been that instead of targeting individual firms, regulators ought to review potentially risky activities in a sector, such as exchange-traded funds. opponents of the activities-based approach say such a method would not have prevented the 2008 financial collapse.
74. in or around august 2016, the federal bureau of investigation issued an alert about the
about the series special counsel robert s. mueller iii spent nearly two years investigating russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether president trump obstructed the inquiry. when his 448-page report was released in april, mueller left one major question unanswered: whether the president broke the law. the special counsel determined that because justice department policy states that a president cannot be indicted, it would not be fair to take a position on whether trump committed a crime. but his report laid out possible evidence of obstruction of justice, as well as a dramatic narrative of an anxious and angry president who tried to control a criminal investigation — even after he knew he was under scrutiny. this six-part series is drawn directly from episodes detailed in the mueller report in which prosecutors found possible evidence of obstruction of justice, as well as congressional testimony and washington post reporting. dialogue in text bubbles is taken verbatim from mueller's report, which cited text messages, contemporaneous notes and investigative interviews with first-hand witnesses who described conversations among key players. words within quotation marks reflect exact dialogue included in the report, or comments made at public events or in media interviews. links throughout each chapter refer to the specific pages of mueller's report that describe the scenes, as well as news stories. illustrations of public events are based on news photographs taken at the time. the president's tweets have been reproduced as they were written, although the number of likes and retweets may have changed over time.

but supporters of the tests maintain that their approach is far more effective than focusing on arrests. pill testing has been shown to change the black market for the better and may even decrease overall drug consumption, as negative results would deter a majority of people from consuming drugs and spur them to warn their friends, according to a summary of arguments in favor of tests by australia's parliamentary library. research by the global drug survey came to a similar conclusion last year.
polarization has also made mainstream american culture hospitable to ideas once relegated to the margins. voters have grown more tolerant of political leaders' failings as long as they adhere to the correct ideological positions, opening a space for someone like trump to win the presidency and then govern with the support of a minority of the electorate. and grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. for instance, twitter equips trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. fox news also capitalizes on this shift to amplify trumpian claims (russia didn't hack our democracy, fox host tucker carlson recently parroted). it's no wonder that, as gallup found last february, 30 percent of republicans see russia in a favorable light. one recent post survey of attitudes toward 2016 election conspiracy theories found that 26 percent of americans believed that crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm, invented a story of russian election meddling in order to hide ukraine's efforts to help hillary clinton.

the academic's answer to the what's russia thinking? question is invariably we don't know — at least not in the theory-driven, hypothesis-testing, evidence-based way we usually think about knowledge. we do not and cannot know who ordered whelan's arrest and on what basis. we don't know whether russian president vladimir putin was involved. and we can't calculate exactly what the kremlin — or the white house, for that matter — will do next.

for the leftist-leaning corbyn, raising the idea of a maximum national wage may have seemed logical. he had already suggested a salary cap during the labour party's 2015 leadership contest, which he went on to win, to the surprise of many of his rivals. and with growing awareness of the problems caused by economic inequality in britain and elsewhere, perhaps it seemed the right timing to bring it up again.
even if democrats end up with control of both houses of congress, little will come easily for biden. the country remains deeply divided, and the party divisions in congress reflect the nation as a whole. trump will be out of office, but he will not necessarily be out of sight — still able to make noise and create disruptions. republicans could snap back from fighting among themselves to unite in ideological opposition to biden's agenda, as they did when he was vice president during barack obama's presidency.

the dwindling numbers of foreign soldiers also means the taliban can no longer generate civilian support through claims of defending afghanistan from foreign invaders. instead, the group might be trying to gain civilian support by demonstrating the group's governing capacity. as the primary authority in many areas, the taliban might see its civilian support erode when it actively prevents access to public services such as education.

other legal scholars said that trump possibly violated 18 u.s. code 241, which makes it illegal to participate in a conspiracy against people exercising their civil rights. that long-standing statute has been used frequently to prosecute acts of voter intimidation, especially those committed by the ku klux klan against black voters.

standardized clock time is immensely useful. it is no exaggeration to say that the modern world depends on it: ships once required it to navigate. the gps systems that guide our cars, planes and farm combines count on standard time to calculate their positions. if you think setting up a phone call between washington and london is difficult now because of differing time zones, imagine if local time varied by a few minutes between washington and pittsburgh, a few degrees of longitude west. in a society dependent on just-in-time supply chains and automated trading that works in microseconds, accurate, precisely calibrated time is as important as electricity.

jeannette chapman, deputy director and senior research associate at george mason university's stephen s. fuller institute, cautioned that the harm from a short shutdown was more reputational than economic. a short shutdown would reinforce the view held by many nationally that the d.c. region is defined by government dysfunction. she believed the actual economic harm from a short-term shutdown would be small, somewhat similar to a snow storm, and any lost economic activity would be mostly made up post-shutdown.

of course, before you can bring up solutions, you have to be able to bring up climate change at all. schools, however, have sometimes been slow to bring climate change into the classroom, especially in conservative areas. lawmakers in states such as florida and texas have pushed bills that would strip climate change from curriculums entirely. in pennsylvania's central bucks school district in 2017, a republican school board member used fears about rising anxiety among the young in lobbying to remove textbooks that discussed climate change.

over time, münzel said, it can take a toll on the body — increasing cholesterol, blood pressure and heart rate. if this persists for years, then you have a risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure and arrhythmia, he told the post.
what's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics — the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems, obama said in the first speech of his 2008 campaign.

former swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt, who rose to power in 2006, also sought to make his conservative moderate party into the swedish worker's party, bringing his party to post-depression heights with policies designed to reduce unemployment. but by 2014, his refusal to limit mass migration of refugees led to workers deserting the moderates for the economically populist and anti-immigration sweden democrats. current polls show moderates have dropped back to their traditional level of support, roughly 20 percent of the vote.
national security under this regime will be used to reinforce and grow positive trade relationships. for example, military tension with china creates the opportunity for sanctions that simulate the function of tariffs (allowing the u.s. to circumvent trade organizations and domestic resistance to tariffs). in a national security policy slaved to trade, any and all security guarantees extended to other nations will require a positive trade arrangement with the u.s. the u.s. simply won't protect or extent security guarantees to any nation that has a non-beneficial economic relationship with the u.s. (i.e. runs a trade deficit).

however, in this instance, she said, i think this reporter needs to carefully consider his role in the controversy, especially given sensitive religious aspects and the possibility that it could move into litigation. as a journalist, his job is to serve the public, and he should be aware if any personal activities could compromise that service, rather than enhance it.

like madison's interactions with henry and soubiron, trump's actions in ukraine expose a troubling tendency to go to dangerous lengths to find criminal connections between political enemies and foreign nationals or governments. they are symptoms of a disease far worse than a single problematic presidency. they reveal that americans have again become caught in a cycle of accusing each other of foreign collusion, which exacerbates political partisanship, which facilitates foreign interference, which again prompts accusations of foreign collusion.

the survey did not poll americans on other hypothetical 2020 candidates, including sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) or sen. kamala d. harris (d-calif.). but what is clear is that more than half of americans seem uninterested in allowing trump to remain in the white house for another term.

qatar is one of the world's wealthiest nations, and its economy has proved resilient. because the country has opened shipping corridors, sales of gas and oil have continued uninterrupted. saudi arabia shocked qatar by closing its only land border, halting shipments of food. but the smaller country quickly opened alternative trade routes and found substitute suppliers, notably turkey, iran and india. denied overflight rights for qatar airways by the boycotting group, it negotiated them with iran. the country remains on good terms with the u.s., which bases thousands of troops and a regional air operations center there. qatar, which quit the oil cartel opec at the start of 2019, has also been charting a different course from its neighbors on energy policy, with its fortunes tied more closely to natural gas. the country is scheduled to host the fifa world cup soccer tournament in 2022.

even then, democrats wouldn't have the votes to make structural changes to government, like ending the senate filibuster, that would pave the way for more ambitious ideas. that means biden probably won't be able to achieve big, transformational goals.
the proposed rule also limits enforcement by only toughening federal scrutiny of communities sued by the federal government — and not private entities including civil rights and fair housing organizations, rice said. that means jurisdictions found liable for discrimination through private lawsuits would still be eligible to receive federal funding, she said.

public health officials have reassured the public that the new variant does not appear to be more deadly or cause people to get sicker, and they say the leading vaccines will still be effective against it. but the atlantic's zeynep tufekci argues that a more transmissible virus may be far more dangerous than a more deadly strain due to the mathematics of exponential growth, as each new infected person infects more people. with vaccinations lagging, a new variant could be potentially catastrophic.
in a last-gasp effort before departing the white house, the trump administration took another swipe at weakening enforcement of a 100-year-old law that protects migrating birds, darryl fears reports. with only two weeks left in office, the administration published a rule tuesday that spares industries and individuals from prosecution or penalties under the migratory bird treaty act if their actions, such as development or failure to cover tar pits, results in bird deaths. if the deaths were unintentional, the u.s. fish and wildlife service says in the rule, there will be no enforcement.

more than 7,000 people in the care of the colorado department of corrections have tested positive for the virus, and the state says 24 have died. anuj mehta, a denver pulmonologist who chaired the advisory group addressing vaccine prioritization, said he thought polis was operating on a principle of trying to save the most lives, though he disagrees with the governor's approach. viral spread hardly stays within prison walls, he noted, mainly because corrections officers return to their families, often in minority and low-income communities.
to reach herd immunity with the coronavirus, approximately 230 million americans would need the vaccine. as of yesterday, just 4 million had gotten the first of two shots. daily immunizations have increased considerably over the past few days, with about 500,000 people getting the shot each day, but experts say that number needs to at least double and ideally quadruple.
and while the film's sense of policy is rather iffy — ronald reagan, the architect of the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, would have been unlikely to use maxwell lord's powers to wish for more nukes, as his fictional doppelgänger does in the film — it gets enough about the world right to work. i will admit to being deeply entertained by the sight of israel defense forces vet gadot taking apart the egyptian king of crude's security force after the tycoon wishes for the colonizers to be pushed into the sea.

with more than a hundred thousand albanians already driven out of kosovo by serb ethnic cleansing, and an unknown number killed, a central question is confronting clinton: why were his foreign policy aims not more closely matched with the military means necessary to achieve them? the essential answer, as offered by a variety of administration officials, is that clinton never believed he had a viable alternative. the use of nato ground troops, never a likely option, was expressly ruled out by the white house in october, when nato military analysts produced a study that concluded it would take as many as 200,000 nato troops to protect kosovo on the ground. as several officials at the white house and at other national security agencies described it in recent days, that number was instantly viewed as a deal-killer. the numbers came in high, said one senior administration official. no one said yes, no one said no; it was taken off the table. . . . it was a complete eye-roller. the idea of troops never had any traction that i remember, said a senior white house official. nato's analysis, officials said, was not a comprehensive study. instead, it was an initial review that some u.s. officials called a swag – military parlance for a scientific wild-ass guess. the 200,000 figure, moreover, was at the high end of the estimates, and was contemplated for a scenario in which troops forcibly occupied all of yugoslavia, a senior defense official said.

meanwhile, modi's controversial move in late 2016 to ­invalidate most of india's bank notes — ostensibly to stem corruption — had a deleterious impact on workers. about 3 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017, according to the center for monitoring indian economy, a research firm in mumbai that conducts a national employment survey. its data also showed that the indian labor force shrank between 2017 and 2018 — not a sign of a healthy job market.
peter feaver, a scholar of civil-military relations and a colleague of dunlap's at duke, said current pentagon leaders were better prepared to handle any attempts to pull them into the transition because of the events of june 2020, when trump sought to use expansive military force to put down widespread protests over police violence against black citizens.

at the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the conscience protection act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers.
neither trump nor white house staff lobbied romney, according to aides. it wouldn't have helped, said one senior white house aide directly involved in the impeachment process.
some activists said the national divisiveness over trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. that fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates.
this is an amazing fact, the true revolutionary aspect of this election cycle. in the parlance of our times, you might say they're demonstrating that most coveted of american commodities: white privilege. sanders and bloomberg are able to simply blend into the mostly old, mostly male, mostly white democratic field. that didn't happen for cory booker or kamala harris, or for julián castro or andrew yang, or for elizabeth warren, or hillary clinton in 2016, for that matter. for women and other minorities, race and gender are still inseparable from public persona. they don't get to decide how they are seen; america sees them first and foremost as women or black or latino or asian.

throwing a party during an arctic blast or after a blizzard is a wonderful way to bring housebound friends together to try to forget the misery that is the outdoors. consider the weather when planning your party, say entertaining experts, and channel hygge, the danish winter mode that involves hot tea, hand-knit throws and log fires. dump the icy cocktails, heat up some glogg and get a fire going, even if it's a fire pit in the back yard. light lots of candles and serve comfort foods. what you want for a winter party is an atmosphere of coziness and warmth — both mentally and physically.
both declarations backfired spectacularly. iraq descended into civil war. meanwhile, as the u.s. government fixated on iraq, the taliban steadily regrouped.
the issue came to the fore again with hurricane katrina in 2005, when religious organizations — not just houses of worship but major nonprofit agencies and institutions — suffered millions in property damage. the bush administration said it would help rebuild parochial schools, nursing homes and similar religious institutions but would not pay for the rebuilding of houses of worship.
these leaders likely would resign before following an unlawful order, the senior official said, adding, however, i think it's unfair to assume that the president would issue an unlawful order.
if we have learned anything from the coronavirus and swine flu h1n1 epidemic of 2009, it is that we cannot necessarily depend on other countries, even close allies, to supply us with needed items, from face masks to vaccines, said peter navarro, a senior white house adviser on trade and manufacturing policy.
in reality, the operation appears to have entered a protracted period of decline. by the mid-1990s, the days of profit were long past, and crypto would have gone out of business but for infusions from the u.s. government.

but trump's obsession with the bottom line permeates his approach to governing, including his current stance toward baghdad: we own you. you owe us. we had iraq, trump said on face the nation last year. we spent a fortune on building this incredible base. we might as well keep it. that idea has stuck with the president, and on jan. 3, he tweeted that the united states has paid iraq billions of dollars a year, for many years. that is on top of all else we have done for them.
for the industry and its supporters on capitol hill, the pieces were falling into place.
the decision to kill iranian maj. gen. qasem soleimani without any apparent plan for managing iran's inevitable retaliation is typical of how trump has always operated. he takes pride in acting swiftly and decisively, in the moment. he does not want to hear about antedecents that might inform his decision-making or about how today's decision might alter future options.
ahead of wednesday's meeting, trump argued in a fresh tweet that the $5.6 billion for the wall included in a house-passed bill was very little in comparison to the benefits of national security.

the first problem the app faced was simply getting people to download it. emails and letters to 400 ibm employees offering a $20 gift card yielded just 30 sign-ups. the recruitment letter was tweaked and the bonus was upped to $50, but out of 700 letters sent out, only 60 people signed up. the second problem was getting people to use it. although users told the harvard research team that they thought the app had a good interface and functionality, it was out of sight and out of mind when they got sick.

border adjustment will be challenged under international trade agreements. proponents tell us that not taxing exports is only treating our income tax like a value-added tax, which normally is not imposed on exports. but countries with vats also have income taxes. could the u.s. persuade the world trade organization that exempting exports from income taxes is the equivalent of doing so for a vat or sales tax? that's doubtful, but if the answer is yes, other countries could do it as well—dissipating any u.s. advantage from subsidizing exports.

if biden is serious about creating a national jobs corps, then the federal government should hire every unemployed american at a living wage of, say, $58,000 a year. this would cost roughly $1.1 trillion annually — far more than either political party has offered — but it's an amount that the government could absorb and manage. it also would greatly reduce the inefficiencies, squabbles and fraud surrounding the various unemployment and income-assistance programs that have been doled out over the past several months.

first, the party in power is not great at guessing whom it should run against. it's an open secret that republicans consider warren to be the weakest top-tier democratic candidate. the arguments for that run from the sensible (president trump has defined her effectively as pocahontas) to the fanciful (she's a female baby boomer and trump already beat one of those). early polling backs some of this up; quinnipiac's pre-christmas survey found that 37 percent of voters already viewed warren negatively, more than any other democrat.
consider yourself warned: if you arrive at the airport with the luggage non grata, the airline will not permit the piece onboard. you will have to repack your belongings in your secondary bags or purchase new luggage at the airport — a costly solution for a careless mistake.
the last official survey results, released feb. 8 before a government-imposed media blackout, showed a tight race. front-runners are the ruling alianza pais (ap) candidate, lenín moreno, who served as vice president from 2007 to 2013; and the creando oportunidades (creo) movement's guillermo lasso, a conservative former economy minister and banker who was a distant presidential runner-up in 2013.

the controversy over instagram stories highlights the challenge for technology companies as the tools they created to connect friends are increasingly being used for political messaging — perhaps with consequences they never intended.
i would attribute some of the rise in the price of gold to the feeling of uncertainty surrounding that [north korean-u.s.] dialogue, said meghan milloy, director of financial services policy at the american action forum, in an email to the washington post.
i've seen the indie clothing websites, where kids defy stereotypes in organic cotton. i'm glad they're out there. but it's invariably $30 for a t-shirt and they rarely go on sale. either that, or the science- and ninja- patterns only come in dresses, because there's only so many stereotypes girls should challenge at a time. (alice hasn't tolerated a dress since she was 18 months old, so those are out, too.)
yet liberals were quick to signal they may not be patient. as the georgia results became clearer wednesday, d.c. mayor muriel e. bowser posted a tweet saying simply #dc statehood along with a video of her telling a crowd, i was born without representation, but i will not die without representation.
in the fall of 2012, the dea embarked on its biggest diversion action to date, filing a civil case against walgreens. the agency accused one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains of flooding florida with painkillers. the case would ultimately result in an $80 million fine.
trump's remarks set off a firestorm in india, where officials indignantly noted that india is the largest donor in the region and has contributed more than $3 billion in postwar reconstruction, including a 135-mile road, a dam providing irrigation to farmers and training programs for more than 3,500 afghans in india. new delhi has also provided 1.1 million tons of wheat to afghanistan as well as a 400-bed children's hospital. officials said that small libraries have been built as part of community development projects, but were puzzled why trump focused on a single library.
gottlieb plans to write letters to the companies to criticize them for publicly pledging to remove nicotine flavor pods from store shelves, while secretly negotiating a financial partnership that seems to do the opposite, the new york times's sheila kaplan reports. the commissioner also wants the companies leaders to come to the agency to explain their plans.

wall street power: conservatives and liberals are quick to point out the cozy relationship between wall street and the other party.
the question — rarely confronted by news organizations before — became relevant this week after the new york times revealed that the practice of padding individual follower counts is widespread. the newspaper said dozens of prominent people, from entertainers to athletes to politicians, bought twitter followers from a florida-based bulk seller in a quest to appear bigger and more popular on the platform.
if honduras follows through with the move, it will please both trump and netanyahu. the united states moved its embassy in israel to a u.s. consulate building in jerusalem in may, months after trump said he would overturn decades of u.s. policy and officially recognize the city as the capital of israel.
russian officials have long contended that the presence of u.s. forces in syria is illegal. there's simply no debate that russia was happy with trump's decision to withdraw. even if both countries are fighting the islamic state, they nonetheless have a range of competing interests in the region.

comments posted on greitens's facebook page reflected a mixed reaction to the wednesday's revelations.
but there was another choice — biden and the democrats or trump and the republicans — for this was a tribal election in a nation of political tribes. the four candidates — democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock and republicans david perdue, whose term expired sunday, and kelly loeffler, who was appointed to the senate a year ago — fought their individual races but were merely players in a much larger battle over the direction of the country in the post-trump era.

ohio's voter registration rules are some of the country's most punitive. voters who fail to cast ballots for two years receive a notice in the mail. if they don't respond, change their registration or vote in the following four years, they are purged from the rolls.
despite the far-reaching impacts of the shutdown, much of the federal government has not been touched. major agencies such as the pentagon and the department of health and human services have already been funded through the end of the fiscal year, sept. 30, thanks to spending bills passed by congress last year.
cia strikes are far less frequent than they were under obama, but the agency remains authorized to conduct such attacks.
that is, you catch a criminal and you take his name. you say you're released into our country. i ended it. you're released. come back in four years. we're going to take you to court. so far, nobody's ever shown up. i mean, literally, they almost don't show up and turn out. that's when i had the big debate with biden. they come back for court. i said, no, they don't.
translation: sales pitches are sales pitches. should chuck todd be unavailable to moderate an event, surely axios will be happy with megyn kelly or matt lauer. or with hallie jackson or thomas roberts. any one of these television personalities brings name recognition as well as experience in conducting discussions. big-money sponsors — not to mention attendees — adore these types of adjacencies.

romney declines to disavow trump's comments about obama.
it may face an uphill climb, though: the for the people act, which also includes provisions to expand voting access and increase campaign finance disclosures, is an early peek at democrats' top priorities for the session -- but bipartisan cooperation is more stalled than ever as large parts of the federal government are still shut down amid a dispute with president trump over border funding.
environmental attorney robert bilott successfully sued dupont on behalf of plaintiffs exposed to pfoa in ohio and west virginia, and this year he filed a class-action lawsuit against 3m, dupont, chemours and several other companies on behalf of all americans with pfas chemicals in their blood. some states have taken aggressive steps on their own, with new jersey the first to regulate certain types of pfas chemicals in its drinking water.
biden also plans to name amanda sloat as senior director for europe on the nsc, said two people familiar with the decision. the former brookings institution fellow served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for southern europe and eastern mediterranean affairs at the state department.
the final 7.8 percent of the crowds were involved in actions directed at other politicians or about issues that were neither pro- nor anti-trump. we found a broad range of such topics, as we have in previous months. in one protest against the line 5 pipeline in lansing, mich., a horse even joined the protest inside the state capitol building. we regularly see protests against a proposed school closing. this month, for example, protesters were opposed to closing the pioneer school in portland, ore., and p.s. 92 in the bronx.
pregnant women are agonizing over whether to get coronavirus vaccines. while health experts anticipate that the coronavirus vaccines, like most other vaccines, are probably safe for pregnant women and less dangerous than contracting the virus, they have not been tested and there is no safety data available. the centers for disease control and prevention, and the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, said that vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant or lactating women, leaving the decision up to patients and their doctors, the post's frances stead sellers reports
-- sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) zeroed in on her 2020 message during an iowa visit as she conspicuously avoided using trump's name. annie linskey and chelsea janes report: she aimed directly at voters tempted by [trump's] angry populism in 2016 but avoided mentions of trump himself almost entirely. … for warren, virtually every position she advocated was, in policy terms, a repudiation of the president and the course he has set for the nation in his first two years. that was true from specifics — her demand that presidential candidates release their taxes, which the president has refused to do — to the generic — her repeated lament that the middle class has been hollowed out as economic and political fairness has been lost.

correa boasted a majority government for a large chunk of his presidency, the first president to do so since ecuador's return to democracy in 1979. dogged by corruption allegations surrounding the government, ap isn't likely to earn a majority in the next national assembly. with their weak organization and national penetration, the opposition parties are even less likely to do so.

while a new crop of football prospects have gathered in indianapolis this week for the nfl scouting combine with hopes of long and lucrative playing careers, the game's veterans know it is never too early to think about life beyond football. from day 1, everybody tells you that football won't be your last job, said pericak, who earned his undergraduate degree from the university of colorado in finance as well as a masters in accounting.
brown, a five-time pro bowler who led the nfl in receptions in 2014 and 2015, was also chided by roethlisberger. the locker room is a sacred place where things are said and hugs and tears, and it's kind of a special place. so a little disappointed with ab for that, roethlisberger said tuesday on a pittsburgh radio show. coach talks and then i talk, and you just don't want everyone to know what's going on in there with the family. and also, i wish ab would have been listening to coach and myself instead of being on the other side of the locker room filming.

but trump won the election, and ever since his insults have been perceived, by the press, as masterful distractions that no democrat can effectively rebut. since her dna test, warren has simply stopped responding to trump's insults; over four iowa events, she mentioned the president's name only once, when asked about the aforementioned test, saying that she simply could not stop him from hurling racial slurs.
though they don't commit organizations to any specific action, the resolutions send a signal that there are support networks for students struggling with climate change. they also bolster the idea that students can at least make a difference by raising awareness: jordyn bauer, a 20-year-old sophomore at california's sonoma state university who worked to pass a resolution in her california school district in 2018, said it helped validate her ability to do something. too many people are just standing by, she says. i felt like it was my responsibility to take charge.

in the district, standardized test scores — which are highly correlated to zip code and family income — did indeed dramatically rise over the past decade. but officials didn't like to mention that proficiency rates of d.c. students would still be considered failing in a high-performing district or that a wide achievement gap persists between white students and black and hispanic students. some in the district also say that test scores rose because the percentage of white students — who traditionally do better on standardized tests — has grown in district schools in recent years.

to point this out is not to suggest that i know of a more objective system for determining how income should distributed. rather, it is to suggest that if we, as a society, decide that we find the current distribution of income unacceptable — if it offends our moral intuitions that a single financier earns as much in a year as 15,000 elementary school teachers — then it violates no great moral or economic principle to alter that distribution.

among our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. while more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.

the establishment had come to a similar conclusion in 2012 when mitt romney lost, deciding that, among other things, it needed to expand its base to include more non-white voters, perhaps by moving away from a hard line on immigration. (even sean hannity embraced the idea when the political winds blew in that direction.) but it didn't need to make such a move to win in 2016. instead, trump's candidacy reinforced cultural and racial politics far more openly than those of past republicans, helping stoke the energy of republican voters. against an unpopular democratic opponent that year, his fervent base proved to be large enough in enough states to win him the white house.

after considering various options, we believe he may be talking about a conversation with nursultan nazarbayev, the president of kazakhstan. trump has met twice with nazarbayev, including once at the white house. the kazakhstan government in 2018 approved an agreement to allow the united states to use two of its ports for shipping nonmilitary material to afghanistan and has allowed overflights since 2010. but the text of the agreement (see article 18) says that u.s. military transport aircraft would not be subject to payment of air navigation fees, only nonmilitary aircraft. there could be reasonable airport fees assessed if any planes landed at airports.

and maggie haberman, a white house correspondent for the new york times, made a broader point about the coverage overall: the current theme out of some in the wh comms shop is 'there's no chaos to see in this white house,' a narrative trump has hoped will replace the actual reporting. this kelly interview affirms most of the real-time reporting about how it is there.
experts say there are resources potential travelers should consider when deciding whether to call off a trip, including advice and situation reports from the world health organization, advisories from the state department — which often contain detailed information about specific regions within a country — and notices from the cdc. as of monday, the health agency warned americans to avoid nonessential travel to china, iran, south korea and italy and to enhance precautions in japan because of the coronavirus.
farewell to the little dance where a server brings you water and disappears; comes back to take your drink order and disappears; returns with cocktails, recites the specials and disappears while you decide on what to have for dinner. the pace of the evening is now in your hands. know what you want to drink? order as soon as you sit down, and you can sip while deciding what to snack on. anyone who's needed to make a quick exit because of a cranky child (or cranky adult who's had one too many), appreciates the ability to settle the bill instantly and quietly.

in 2020, the space force became the first new military branch since the air force was established in 1947, in part because of bipartisan support in congress, which concluded that space — like the land, sea and air — is a warfighting domain that needs to be defended. it's here to stay, said rep. kendra horn (d-okla.), who lost her reelection bid but served on the house armed services committee and as chair of a subcommittee on space. it was not about this administration — this was a long-term, thoughtful and bipartisan effort looking at the current and future needs of our national security.

ultimately, of course, to the distress of most federalists, the supreme court upheld the law in 2012. yet to barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, chief justice roberts found other grounds to support the law.

but now carl moves to montana, together with his assets. mike thinks that's fine — he can just collect the assets in montana. yet if sb97 is enacted, that couldn't be done. after all, the right to civil trial by jury is a fundamental right under the montana constitution. the canadian court decision in mike montanan's favor thus violates the public policy of montana and is void and unenforceable, because it's based on a law, legal code, or system that would not grant the parties affected by the ruling or decision the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the montana constitution (the right to trial by civil jury). mike has to go back into montana court and sue carl again.

to guarantee a decent wage, a number of places i've visited in the past year, from fancy restaurants to casual cocktail spots to rooftop beer gardens, have levied mandatory service charges of around 20 percent. they offer the chance to leave more, but not less, preventing customers from stiffing a server over a perceived slight. it's a great start — we should all be adding 20 percent anyway, right? — while the industry and governments come to grips with the mechanics and failures of tipping. gratitude is a buzzword this year. let's start with restaurant employees.

both democrats said the risk is worth a chance to set the state's direction on the economy and long-ignored social inequities from a higher office. they also expressed confidence in their party's ability to hold on to their seats.
progressive groups are planning to apply fresh pressure on democrats who voted to temporarily extend government funding in december without addressing daca — a mix of moderates facing reelection this year in states trump won in 2016 and others from states with sizable populations of federal government workers.
these are old chestnuts. trump is citing claims made by bryan geels, a certified public accountant who owns a data analytics firm, and matt braynard, a former trump campaign staffer and election data analyst. geels came up with the first two figures and braynard the third. but they were rejected by state officials in december and again when trump raised them in a phone call to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger on saturday.
each of these factors will play a role in achieving local, regional or national herd immunity protection. i feel confident we can achieve the first factor of sufficient vaccine by the late summer or early fall. but ultimately, the second two factors, how many will be vaccinated and how durable is immune protection will determine the answer to this question. i hope, when considering all three factors, it will be late summer or early fall, but we all realize hope is not a strategy.

i was therefore excited to see that mckinsey had a new empirical study that provides evidence in favor of the view that corporations should take longer views. they have a reasonable methodology. they divide their sample between companies that take a long-term view and those that do not and then compare their performance. they find that companies that take a long-term view perform better on many metrics such as employment growth and shareholder return.

according to standard conceptions of democracy — which focus on violations of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, assembly and the press — hungary's status as an autocracy is ambiguous. the two most widely used indexes of democracy — conducted by freedom house and polity — continue to code hungary as democratic.
but compared with the rest of fiscal 2019, it was the lowest monthly total and a 65 percent drop from the may peak, morgan noted. he said the agency had essentially ended catch-and-release, the term trump administration officials use to refer to the practice of releasing border crossers from detention with a notice to appear in court.
but he only briefly alluded to the humanitarian crisis, suggesting a wall would be the solution by dissuading women and children from attempting a dangerous journey.
despite biden's insistence that he'll beat trump like a drum, it isn't hard to imagine trump gutting him like a fish. republicans in congress are already ramping their investigation of hunter biden back up, and you can bet they'll use that story to cast a pall over joe biden as corrupt or just vaguely untrustworthy.

-- trump reiterated his threat to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall. robert costa, felicia sonmez and nick miroff report: trump also said sunday that he understood the predicament facing hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are not receiving their paychecks. 'i can relate, and i'm sure the people who are on the receiving end will make adjustments; they always do,' trump said. he claimed that 'many of those people agree with what i'm doing': refusing to reopen the government without obtaining funding for his long-promised border wall. and he further backed away from the notion of a concrete wall, telling reporters that he has informed his staff to now say 'steel barrier.'

frutiger had figured out the minerva secret and it was not safe with him, according to the cia history. even so, the agency was livid with wagner for firing frutiger rather than finding a way to keep him quiet on the company payroll. frutiger declined to comment for this story.
at the same time, parenting anxiety is at an all-time high. a complete reordering of the skills and technologies that affect our economy has left many parents feeling like we are preparing our children for life on a planet we have not even visited. that makes it tough to dismiss the allure of being the best, as that at least feels familiar. so parents worry about getting their kid into the right preschool, or how to hire expensive sat tutors, or how they can pull strings to procure choice internships.

president trump's bid to overturn the results of the election, including pushing senators to object to certifying his electoral college loss today, provides a final reminder of his unstable leadership. executives have evidently had enough. from cnbc's sara eisen:

nearly 10 million jobs lost during the spring still have not returned — especially in restaurants, travel and education — a higher number than at the worst point of the great recession. in the post-vaccine world, millions of americans will have to find new jobs (or entirely new careers), a process that takes time. and that burden is likely to fall disproportionately on black workers. so far, black americans have recovered only 53 percent of the jobs they lost, compared with 66 percent for whites (and 69 percent for hispanics).
across the united states, limited funding has undermined end-of-year efforts to hire coronavirus vaccine staff, create vaccination centers and raise awareness. (reuters)
kabul bank, the country's biggest, nearly collapsed under the weight of $1 billion in fraudulent loans — an amount equal to one-twelfth of the country's entire economic output the year before. the afghan government engineered an emergency bailout to stem a run on the bank as angry crowds lined up to withdraw their savings.
those accounts were later suspended by twitter. the post found an archived version of a misleading tweet and also several news reports and tweets by journalists during the alabama election describing evidence that russian bots were supporting moore. the project birmingham document cited an article in the new york post with the headline roy moore flooded with fake russian twitter followers.
despite trump's defeat in november, many republicans took solace in the fact that their down-ballot candidates in key house and senate races did better than the president. in georgia, perdue came within three-tenths of a percentage point of winning outright. loeffler was in a multicandidate field and so was always destined to be in a runoff.
it is impossible to ignore present-day comparisons. trump and madison both got caught up in conspiracy theories that foreign actors held legal dirt on their political rivals. neither possessed good evidence that his opponents had committed crimes, but they still leveraged public money and executive resources to obtain potentially incriminating information about political foes. both initially tried to hide their actions from congress and the public (madison with henry's misleading cover letter and trump with the placement of the july 25 call transcript in a secure server). both schemes also had the cover of a legitimate investigation into wrongdoing and foreign interference, even as the president accepted help from corrupt foreign nationals (such as soubiron in madison's case or ukrainian yuri lutsenko in trump's).
there is absolutely no precedent for courts looking to a politician's statements from before he or she took office, let alone campaign promises, to establish any kind of impermissible motive. the 9th circuit fairly disingenuously cites several supreme court cases that show that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating establishment and equal protection clause claims. but the cases it mentions do nothing more than look at legislative history — the formal process of adopting the relevant measure. that itself goes too far for textualists, but it provides absolutely no support for looking before the start of the formal deliberations on the measure to the political process of electing its proponents.
in other states, the worst-case scenarios did not materialize. hospitals in new mexico did not need to ration care as authorized a month ago by gov. michelle lujan grisham (d). states in the upper midwest and the dakotas, which experienced some of the worst spikes in cases and hospitalizations before thanksgiving, are starting to see cases level off.
the fact that we saw such a bifurcated vote in november, between democrats voting early and republicans voting on election day, makes me hopeful, shipley said.
as rick indicates, crowding might at some point limit the ability of foot voters to enter attractive jurisdictions. however, such effects need not be a major problem in a system where there are hundreds or even thousands of jurisdictions competing with each other. while some may become crowded, others will not. moreover, crowding is not a fixed fact of nature, but often the effect of policy. it can be mitigated by changing such policies as excessively restrictive zoning, which artificially limits the amount of housing available to potential migrants.
but if the pandemic has proved anything, it's that restaurant business plans are meant to be scrapped, or at least adapted. white-tablecloth restaurateurs have simplified menus to pivot into carryout and third-party delivery. chefs have carved out spaces in the back of the house for ghost kitchens selling comfort foods far removed from their original concepts, available just for takeaway or delivery. operators have opened small retail markets, subleased spaces for pop-ups or developed branded products to sell in retail stores. flexibility and adaptability have become keys to survival, and no one bats an eye when, say, a refined seafood restaurant now sells chicken parm, meatloaf, and mac and cheese.

but many teachers told me they're supported by the next generation science standards, written in 2013 to overhaul science teaching. created by officials from 26 states and several national science education organizations, the standards take climate change as a given, expecting students to be taught that human activities contribute to global warming and that the phenomenon is having a dire effect on human life. they also go deep on solutions, such as clean energy. so far, though, only 20 states and the district of columbia have adopted the standards, although 24 other states have drawn up their own guidance based on them.
four surveys show that trump's primary voters were more likely to support sending troops to the middle east than republicans who supported another candidate. in each survey, at least two-thirds of trump's primary voters favored sending troops to fight the islamic state, also known as isis.

trump has become the silence between the notes of warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy. when warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the million dollars a day that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former wells fargo chief executive john stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. it's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.

while there's no actual conflict of interest because overberg isn't using his position to influence a personal matter, there could be a perceived conflict, said kathleen bartzen culver, director of the center for journalism ethics at the university of wisconsin. it would be easy for people to assume his activism makes his journalism suspect, she said.
mine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.

-- democratic operatives with ties to a disinformation campaign in last year's alabama senate race, which was inspired by russian tactics, are attempting to distance themselves from the effort. craig timberg, tony romm, aaron c. davis and elizabeth dwoskin report: recent revelations about project birmingham … have shocked democrats in alabama and washington. and news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign. … but all those who have acknowledged playing a role in project birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in [a document on the operation]. project birmingham got its funding from internet billionaire reid hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of democratic causes after the 2016 election. while acknowledging his money ended up paying for project birmingham, hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the new york times and the post.
more to the point, why is trump handing off chunks of the world — syria, afghanistan, the sea of azov — to america's greatest international foe? (some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) and where does this giveaway stop — at the baltics? at berlin? (it's stunning that hawks such as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), who'd melt down if president barack obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)

the controversy that got trump impeached began when he wanted to withhold aid from ukraine, in part because of his long-standing resentment of america's tradition of helping other countries with humanitarian, military and economic aid: why aren't all of these countries — why aren't they paying? why is it always the united states that has to pay?

mail: keep your u.s. address, advises zachary stafford, a professional housesitter who has been traveling the world for the past five years. you can sign up for a service such as postscan mail or ipostal1, which receive your mail and forward it to you or scan your mail and send you an email with the image of the outside of each item. they can also provide check-cashing services.
insurance: you'll need it. u.s. health insurance generally doesn't cover routine care while abroad. and if you have a medical condition, you may have to pay out of pocket for a doctor or hospital visit. tom wahlin, who traveled internationally for a year, shopped around before finding a policy through aetna international that cost less than conventional health insurance.

sen. tim kaine (d-va.) said he doubted zinke's local voice matters justification for exempting florida and suggested the agency sided with scott because the governor is a trump ally and florida is home to the president's so-called winter white house.
for these reasons, immunization experts tapped by the centers for disease control and prevention to develop federal recommendations to guide state planning have highlighted the needs of incarcerated populations and people living in homeless shelters. guidance approved recently by the cdc's advisory committee on immunization practices put corrections officers in what is known as phase 1b, along with other front-line workers and people aged 75 and older, recommending states immunize inmates at the same time or, depending on vaccine supply, in the next phase. colorado's plan essentially strips them from that tier.

since 2002, the united states has allocated more than $83 billion in security assistance to afghanistan, a sum that dwarfs the defense budgets of other developing nations. in 2011, at the peak of the war, afghanistan received $11 billion in security aid from washington — $3 billion more than what neighboring pakistan, which has a stockpile of nuclear weapons and a far bigger army, spent that year on its military.
jpmorgan says bitcoin could be just shy of $150k in the long run: bitcoin's market capitalization of around $575 billion would have to rise by 4.6 times — for a theoretical price of $146,000 — to match the total private sector investment in gold via exchange-traded funds or bars and coins, strategists led by nikolaos panigirtzoglou wrote in a note, bloomberg news's joanna ossinger reports.

on a conference call last thursday, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell told his caucus that, in his 36 senate years, he has twice cast votes to take the nation to war and once to remove a president, but that the vote he will cast this wednesday to certify [biden's victory] will be the most important of his career, legendary conservative columnist george will reports. the day before mcconnell's somber statement, missouri's freshman republican senator, josh hawley, announced that on wednesday, 14 days before biden will be inaugurated, he will challenge the validity of biden's election. hawley's conscience regarding electoral proprieties compels him to stroke this erogenous zone of the gop's 2024 presidential nominating electorate. …

suffolk university has for years asked americans what tv news or commentary source they trust most, offering options such as cnn, fox news, pbs and msnbc. fox news consistently earned most-trusted marks simply by holding the majority of republicans. but in the first suffolk poll released after the election, fox news is now running about even with none of the above.
madison took the bait, jumping at the opportunity to confirm his suspicions about his political adversaries. he spent $50,000 of state department money to obtain the documents. the administration asked henry to write a misleading cover letter that implied that he donated the documents to the government, withholding the fact that madison had paid the entire balance of the contingent foreign intercourse budget to receive them.

find primary opponents to run against them. ideally, support an ethics finding to expel them from the house and senate (a two-thirds majority is required, so let's not get our hopes up). what these republicans did was inexcusable. their more respectable colleagues cannot simply kiss and make up after defeating their attempt to obliterate democracy.
that's not the only reason to be skeptical. while sanders might not depress democratic turnout in the way some other candidate might, his ability to bring significant numbers of new voters in — without simultaneously motivating higher turnout among republicans that would cancel it out — is for the moment a proposition without evidence to back it up.

consumer tools are proliferating to help people, but that has left the health-care landscape littered with digital walled gardens — web portals where patients can access their medical records, insurance company websites with information about their plan, fitness apps where patients collect their own data. a person might find a doctor on one website but have to log in somewhere else to find out whether the physician is covered by their plan. people who search for their symptoms don't automatically get served information linked to their benefits, advising them on where they could go and how much it would cost.

for many years, i pictured this thought experiment set in a jury chamber, where a group of individuals is stripped of status and permitted to deliberate upon only the information handed to them. but as my life has filled with images of hospital nurseries, with their the rows of bald and oblivious babies; and schoolrooms, filled with their rows of dimpled hands clasping no. 2 pencils, it's not difficult to see that parenting puts us in the middle of this experiment. as parents, we have to help create the world we want our children to live in.

as tom wright pointed out in the atlantic, this fits perfectly into beijing's calls for a reset of u.s.-china relations, which from beijing's perspective requires washington to back off from confronting the chinese government's behavior on a range of issues, including its military expansion, economic aggression and internal repression.

what's more unusual is the alphabet union's decision to welcome contractors, fisk said. companies have figured out they can lower their labor costs by hiring their workers as contractors, because essentially it allows them to opt out of protective labor and employee laws legislation, so the group of workers who are eligible to unionize under the nlra has correspondingly shrunk, she said.

because we are jews, we naturally prepare for the worst. many are already steeling themselves against the possibility of an anti-semitic onslaught the likes of which we've never seen before, declaring this election cycle catnip to anti-semites of every creed and color. certainly, it's possible that the democratic primary race is a friendlier space for jewish politicians than the general election will be; president trump, after all, ran an anti-semitic ad while running against hillary clinton, who isn't jewish.

nancy pelosi is once again the speaker of the house, returning to the job after eight years despite 15 members of her party not voting for her. what matters for 2020 is that 20 democrats in districts carried by the president backed the new speaker; republicans, who need to win at least 19 seats to flip the house, immediately painted targets on them.
the corollary to romney's and toomey's indictments is that the coup plotters are so blinded by ambition that they cannot uphold their oaths. allowing them to caucus with the rest of the party, handing them committee chairs and carrying out the charade that they ever operate apart from self-interest would be to affirm that the gop plainly has no standards and tolerates seditious actors.
the house a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the hyde amendment — permanent, but the senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. the house also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the senate is seen as unlikely to pass.

-- republican sen. susan collins (maine), who is up for reelection next year, said the senate should vote on the funding bills passed in the house. from the hill's brett samuels: collins said on nbc's 'meet the press' that she understands [mitch mcconnell] is in a difficult spot because the president may not sign bills passed by the democratic-held house, but pressed for a vote to reopen agencies like agriculture, interior, transportation and housing and urban development. 'i'm frustrated in the situation that we've gotten to this point where both sides appear to be intransigent,' collins said. 'it is not a sign of weakness to figure out a middle ground. i think that both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen and to compromise.'
later national leaders changed strategies, learning from local activists — like those colorado women — that partnering with groups like unions and farmers' organizations resulted in dramatic leaps forward.
the point was brought home in public testimony, when joseph bick, director of health-care services for the california department of corrections and rehabilitation, told the cdc advisory group that, prisons are essentially long-term care facilities with bars. california, where more than 40,000 inmates have been infected and about 130 have died, has already begun vaccinating some high-risk inmates. officials have not yet decided how to prioritize the broader inmate population, said ali bay, a spokeswoman for the state health department.
the official and others said crocker, as well as u.s. military commanders and others in washington, did not want to risk alienating karzai, because they needed his support as tens of thousands of additional u.s. soldiers arrived in the war zone.

a review of romney's interactions with trump since the beginning of 2011 — a period covering both men's presidential bids and romney's senate race — makes clear that romney's attacks on trump are well attuned to the political thermostat. when he wanted trump's support, for example in 2012, romney refused to criticize trump's birtherism — unlike his strong criticism of trump in summer 2017 after the president waffled on criticizing self-proclaimed white nationalists at a rally in virginia.

other republicans also pointed fingers. a writer for national review cited a trio of factors:
the first visit to a primary state by a top-tier democratic presidential candidate found a candidate still honing her stump speech, with a well-oiled campaign infrastructure and audiences that were still in the tire-kicking phase. it revealed plenty about how warren, who has been urged to run for president since at least 2013, would approach a real campaign. the caricature of warren — by mid-december, she was being covered as a flawed and stumbling liberal who had missed her best shot to run for president — did not survive intact. here's what replaced it.

in any democracy, elected officials have advantages over their challengers, including an easier time attracting media coverage and business support, because the government can deliver resources and policy benefits. but an uneven playing field means leaders use those advantages in ways that profoundly impair the opposition's ability to compete. let's look at how that works.

bear in mind that these polls are all months old, predating the fight over the u.s.-mexico border wall and trump's midterm-campaign focus on migration (including that notorious ad implying that migrants approaching the border were dangerous criminals). but, then, the suffolk university poll in 2016 lines up fairly well with the quinnipiac university poll from july, suggesting that views of trump on race have been reinforced, not altered, by his presidency.

third on the list comes germany, with a trade surplus with the united states running at $59.6 billion in 2016. if trade is all that matters, perhaps, it should not have come as such a surprise to hear trump strike right at berlin's heart when called nato obsolete and argued that u.s. partners are not paying what they are supposed to be paying.
other house conflict of interest rules could apply to price. while the house ethics rules allow a member to vote on a bill that has wide applicability, even if it will affect a stock in which he is invested, the house ethics manual warns that you may be getting into deeper ethical problems when you introduce legislation and then buy a stock affected by that legislation.
so what does this mean in practice? china runs by far the largest trade surplus with the united states, some $319 billion in 2016. that's nearly half of the u.s. trade deficit of $666 billion with just one country. in fact, china bought just $104 billion in u.s. goods last year, but exported some $423 billion worth of goods to the united states.

their core concern is one that all american parents contend with: schools with standards that are inconsistent from district to district or state to state and that, in many instances, don't adequately prepare children for career or college. but what sets military families apart is that, by design, they are highly nomadic. our armed forces function more effectively when officers and enlisted personnel, with their varied roles and tenure, are rotated among the many u.s. military installations. children in military families attend as many as nine schools during their k-12 years.

the new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. the graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.

the breaches were so alarming that they had government and private-sector personnel working through the holidays to identify and mitigate them, the task force said, describing them as ongoing cyber compromises. that sense of urgency stands in contrast to trump's effort last month to play down the significance of the breaches, saying that everything is well under control.

the president's words also reverberated far beyond twitter, where he boasts more than 88 million followers, and other more traditional social media platforms. trump supporters on lesser-known sites have spent months egging on what they've called a second civil war against democrats and the deep state. many have boosted qanon and other conspiracy theories suggesting that an uprising of covert military forces or civilian militias could help secure trump's presidency.

there's plenty of overlap between warren and sanders on policy, and both are likely to get rounded into one of the press's lanes or tiers as the left's potential candidate. but one of the most interesting debates inside the democratic party right now is between sanders's democratic socialism and warren's reformed progressivism. by doing so well in 2016, sanders exploded the popularity of a political philosophy that had been sidelined in the united states for 100 years; warren hasn't had the same platform to spell out what she stands for.
the oxford scientists say their technique would be cheaper than other biofuel methods and that they hope it can be used on a transatlantic trip within three years. aviation fuel experts outside of the experiment champion the idea but wonder whether it will be feasible at scale since it's more complicated to extract carbon dioxide from the air than from a canister, brown writes.

if nato went into only kosovo in a non-permissive environment, the number of troops required would have been 75,000, an official said – troops that would enter after an air campaign similar to the sort that is now being carried out. even a lower troop count, however, scarcely made the idea of a ground-based campaign more appealing to the clinton white house – either before the air campaign began or now that it is being subjected to widespread second-guessing. this second-guessing, in fact, is prompting an increasingly sullen defense from many white house officials, who complain that clinton is being held by commentators and political opponents to an impossible standard that is constantly shifting. if the united states had pursued a ground strategy, clinton aides say, the administration would have been defying public opinion both here and in other nato countries, and criticized for risking a military quagmire. if the administration had decided not to engage at all in kosovo, clinton would have been assailed for allowing the alliance to go limp in the face of a humanitarian disaster. the only alternative, as senior white house officials have described it this week, is to press on with a bombing campaign that has so far not proven capable of achieving the goal clinton described in his speech to the nation the day the bombing began: to deter an even bloodier offensive against innocent civilians in kosovo. clinton, according to white house aides, always knew that this goal might prove unachievable with air power.

that's against our team policy, so i don't think that would go over well with our coach, brady said on weei's kirk and callahan show. … every coach has a different style. our coach, he's been in the league for 42 years and he's pretty old school. he's not into social media and i think he lets everyone know that. i think our team has a policy, we don't show anything that should be private because he feels when we are inside our stadium, inside the walls, there has to be a degree of privacy that we have. what's done in the locker room should stay in the locker room.

may 21: statewide primaries will take place in kentucky, one of three states that will elect a governor this year. in 2015, eventual democratic nominee jack conway spent the whole campaign evading questions about who he'd back for president, saying he would support joe biden, who was not running. why should a candidate for governor answer that question? it's fair to ask, but tying the democratic candidate to his national party has become a go-to tactic for republicans here. any democrat who wants to prove his or her strength outside of blue america will be paying attention.

while south korea has run more than 35,000 coronavirus tests, the united states has tested only 426 people, not including people who returned on evacuation flights. only about a dozen state and local laboratories can now run tests outside of the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta because the cdc kits sent out nationwide earlier this month included a faulty component.
and that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the affordable care act was passed in 2010. by then barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the federalist society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. his participation in the legal assault on obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the federalist society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the mayflower hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (josh blackman, a popular federalist social media force and a professor at the south texas college of law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, unprecedented: the constitutional challenge to obamacare.) barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'you want to do something about this?' i said, 'sure.' … and he said, 'whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.'

warren's stump speech begins with a little bit about who i am, with a story that quiets down the crowd: about the night she heard her mother muttering, we will not lose this house as she contemplated how to deal with her father's medical bills. she moves on to a vision of changing the rules of three sectors of society: the economy, government and politics.

iraq has been seen largely through the lens of counterterrorism, through the lens of iran, and through the lens of the partisan debate of the last decade, said william wechsler, a senior pentagon official under obama, none of which is about the sovereignty and future of iraq, which is what its people care about.

but that's easier said than done. the party's conservative core is generally opposed to much government activity, prefers letting market forces run unimpeded and places priority on keeping taxes and spending low. working-class voters, however, have always wanted active government and place a higher value on protection from market depredations than on abstract ideas of limited government. squaring this circle is not impossible, but it will require intentional and ongoing management by the party's leaders.

with the delivery of the first doses of vaccine to hospitals in mid-december, the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel grew a bit brighter. the initial shipment of 2.9 million doses was enough only to start inoculating health-care workers and nursing-home residents. but it portended the beginning of the end — the hope that by the middle of 2021, perhaps, anyone who wanted to be vaccinated against the coronavirus could be.

in his campaign, biden highlighted an array of economic policies he promised to embrace, including a much-needed and long overdue tax hike on the wealthiest americans. biden's administration should be able to significantly roll back the massive tax cuts that president donald trump and his allies engineered and, in so doing, help address the searing economic injustices that have accompanied rampant wealth and income inequality in the u.s.

schwarzman declined an invitation to talk through that question. but it's a fair guess that as a staunch defender of free markets, he considers his take a proper reward for his talent, hard work, ingenuity and willingness to take risk over many years. in the past, he has criticized those who blame the wealthy for stagnant middle-class incomes and rising inequality. and when the obama administration proposed a change in tax law that would have reduced his income, an outraged (and later apologetic) schwarzman likened it to adolf hitler's invasion of poland.
manchin has sided with trump on tough votes before, such as the confirmation of supreme court justice brett m. kavanaugh. but voting to acquit the president would be an even more politically charged decision, one that could help him maintain his reputation as a moderate back home but would probably make him a pariah within his own party.
either you had to leave or you had to accept it in a certain way, said caflisch, now 75, who left the company in 1995 but continues to live on the outskirts of zug in a converted weaving factory where she and her family for many years staged semiprofessional operas in the barn. there were reasons i left, she said, including her discomfort with her doubts at crypto and her desire to be home more for her children. after the latest revelations, she said, it makes me wonder whether i should have left earlier.

deborah a.p. hersman, president and chief executive of the national safety council, welcomed the measure, saying history has shown that changing the corporate culture can help shift attitudes in the rest of society. it's also another sign of how many corporations have been trying to do what government – loosely defined – has been ineffective or unwilling to do since mobile phones first appeared 30 years ago, she said.
empathy is a muscle. it would do all of us good to strengthen it, and that means not just reflecting on our experiences but exercising our imaginations. imagine a terrible thing happening to you, and how you would like to be treated in the aftermath; now recognize that the terrible thing already happens to thousands of americans every day. the goal is not to walk a mile in someone else's shoes; the goal is to recognize that someone else's shoes may never fit you and yet they still deserved to be warm and dry.

in expert testimony for the plaintiffs from 2018 in juliana v. united states — a lawsuit filed by a number of young people seeking to force the u.s. government to adopt policies to fight climate change and end fossil fuel subsidies — psychiatrist lise van susteren wrote that children will be at the center of the storm as climate change worsens and that they may already be feeling mental health impacts. day in and day out worrying about the unprecedented scale of the risk posed by climate change ... takes a heavy toll on an individual's well-being, wearing them down, sending some to the 'breaking point,'  she wrote. children are especially vulnerable. those words, she told me, were really painful to write. interviewing children about their fears for nature and their worries about their future families, she says, left her with a sense of shame.
while police officers are not directly involved in those tests, authorities usually set up tolerance areas around testing tents, where consumers will not be arrested for drug use. volunteers inside the tents use laboratory equipment to examine the substances in tests that take about half an hour on average using infrared light. the visual analysis can quickly reveal possible contamination or whether a drug consumer was sold a different drug.

the u.s. postal service has been under siege for months as record volumes of holiday packages and election mail ran up against a spike in coronavirus cases within its workforce, leaving the agency severely short-staffed. nearly 19,000 workers were in quarantine at the end of 2020 after becoming infected or exposed to the virus, jacob bogage reports. that has left hundreds of small publishers struggling to deliver their products, according to the national newspaper association, undercutting their advertising revenues and subscriber bases, and depriving the largely rural communities they serve of crucial news coverage. some news operations have even called on reporters and editors to deliver papers. they're also staring down rate increases of as much as 9 percent in 2022 and for years thereafter. mail service is already one of their biggest costs, industry insiders say, and such a scenario could force hundreds of small publications out of business given their already bite-size margins.

the persistent anti-pelosi campaign devised by the republicans over the years had been successful in adversely affecting public perception of her. not only did she become the personification of everything republicans were supposed to fear, but she became a third rail for some within her own party. over time, democratic candidates distanced themselves from her. asking a candidate whether they would support her for speaker became an ultimate gotcha question.

assad will welcome any return to the arab league, but its significance should not be overstated. on the one hand syria was far from isolated throughout its civil war, and on the other it remains a long way from reconciling with western governments and turkey. not that this will overly concern damascus. the assad regime has decades of experience withstanding western and regional sanctions and isolation, most recently in the mid 2000s.

apparently it's okay for the president to get information from foreign governments in an election — that's news to me, said rep. zoe lofgren (d-calif.), a house manager. as we go forward in this trial itself, we are creating additional dangers to the nation by suggesting that things that have long been prohibited are now suddenly going to be okay because they've been asserted in the president's defense.

barnett realized he had misread the federalist society. despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. he switched from contracts to constitutional law. he made himself an expert on the ninth amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in california, where the state had legalized it. the case ended up relying not on the ninth amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite federalist tool for curbing federal power. barnett argued the matter before the supreme court in 2004. he lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.
bolton subsequently enshrined the new policy in a classified memo directing the departure of u.s. military forces from syria and shifting of responsibility to turkey, said a person familiar with the process. that person, along with several u.s. and foreign officials, spoke about the still-unsettled situation on the condition of anonymity.

rumsfeld disclosed the two memos about the afghan police when he published a memoir in 2011. the memos and other documents show that rumsfeld pushed to train the afghan forces quickly yet wanted to keep them small so the u.s. government would not get stuck with the expense of sustaining a massive foreign army and police force.

trump won the presidency by promising to run the country like a business. he would be the consummate negotiator, driven not by ideology or grand strategy but by his gut, by a plain-spoken, transactional commitment to winning. in this, perhaps more than any other realm, he has fulfilled his promise: he possesses a singular focus on transactions — deals, not relationships; the bottom line, not long-term goals or foundational principles.

then, an infant in a walker opened the door and, with a small thrust, rolled into the room — followed by a seemingly frantic woman who tried to collect them.
but conservative leaders more typically embraced the passion and support of the birchers at the grass roots. at its 1964 national convention, the gop rejected a plank condemning the society, along with its conspiratorial beliefs. birchers such as john rousselot and john schmitz served in congress as republicans in good standing, while conservative oilman and family patriarch fred koch was a founding member of the society. birchers took active part in republican election campaigns and ran right-wing bookstores packed with conspiratorial treatises such as john stormer's none dare call it treason (about soviet infiltration of american government) and fred schwarz's you can trust the communists (to be communists). they served as members of local school boards and state legislatures. other republicans rarely spoke up to debunk the birch view that fluoride in drinking water was part of a communist plot to cause cancer or control americans' minds.

-- all these recalibrations have underscored just how rash that initial announcement was. trump's words pack less of a punch when allies and adversaries alike take them less seriously. president barack obama also learned this the hard way when he said assad using chemical weapons would be a red line and then didn't forcefully respond when he did.

swearingen, who is fluent in spanish, earned a master of divinity from duke divinity school, where she won an award for her preaching.
probably. there's certainly some opportunism at play for trump. but the point is that the fringe keeps doing its thing in ways that are often only tangentially linked to trump. there is some chunk of the republican base that is now invested enough in this divergent soap opera to turn away from fox news. qanon has engaged hundreds of thousands of people in a larp about government conspiracies, satanism and child abuse. the fringe was always more invested in cultural fights than political ones, but, encouraged by trump, those cultural fights are now much further from the gop establishment than they were even four years ago.
pence was deputized by trump to oversee saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.), according to two trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. that meant few specifics were actually discussed saturday, as democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.
there must have been some americans who wondered whether margaret's high-profile singing career was boosted by her father's job. the post's hume never said that, though after her appearance at a dar constitution hall performance in 1949 with the nso, he noted: at the rate of over $100 per minute, miss truman is one of the country's highest paid singers. she has a long way to go if she is to merit her reward.
this was perhaps trump's most famous campaign promise — during the 2016 campaign, trump more than 200 times said mexico would pay for the wall — so he simply pretends that mexico, in some way, is paying for the project or will in the future, in some ill-defined way, such as through a toll. but he has proposed no actual policy to implement this idea — and neither has mexico accepted it.

and greg miller and julian e. barnes write in the los angeles times that obama appeared to leave an opening for the cia to once again go beyond the 19 approved techniques listed in the army field manual. the order calls for the creation of a special task force, headed by the u.s. attorney general, to study whether the army field manual is adequate and to recommend 'additional or different guidance for other departments or agencies.'

balazs highlighted how politicians even in her conservative state have promoted clean energy, and she encouraged her students to take political action. sarah niles, who took balazs's class as a senior, says it was inspiring to learn about solutions to climate change, especially since, so often, the subject felt like devastation with no hope. she recalls days after class where we would go to the common room and just sit because we didn't know what to do. now, she's taking a gap year before college and volunteering in rockport, tex., to help rebuild the community, which was devastated by hurricane harvey in 2017. it's a way, she says, to put a face and a name to things you learn about in class, and feel as if she's making a small difference.

trump, wearing trade rather than national security glasses, sees a much less rosy picture. japan's auto trade is not fair, he said this week. he has also warned toyota could face tariffs if it builds a car factory in mexico, and he argued that japan's government should pay more of the cost of stationing u.s. troops in okinawa.

yet as pay transparency becomes more common — with more employees opening up about what they are paid or websites such as glassdoor making such data more available — the problem could lead to morale issues between workers and headaches for managers. companies, kropp said, will need to make more-frequent adjustments. too many companies don't do that, he said.
in this context, trump is all they've got. they'll take him any day over joe biden and kamala d. harris, who they fear will take biden's place before 2024 arrives.
there is much for this crowd to celebrate. the conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. brett kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his yale law school days, has just been elevated to the supreme court; he is the second of president trump's appointees, following neil gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. they join justice clarence thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the federalist society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), chief justice john roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and justice samuel alito (a periodic speaker at society events). the newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the constitution according to its original meaning. in practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.
that's the same statute cited sunday by david j. worley, the georgia election board member who asked raffensperger to investigate trump. in his email to the gop official, worley said that probable cause may exist to find violations of that law.

may 31-june 2: the california democratic party convention is happening in san francisco this year, and, for the first time since 2008, the state has secured an early slot on the primary calendar. that's likely to turn this into a showcase for multiple democrats, in a forum where a good speech, in front of a massive audience, can get national attention. it was here in 2003 that howard dean pronounced himself a member of the democratic wing of the democratic party and assailed democrats who'd backed the iraq war.

both lawmakers told industry lobbyists that they would be willing to work with the drug companies and had expressed interest in introducing legislation on their behalf, according to an email unsealed in the cleveland case.
pompeo's elevated standing in the cabinet is in part a reflection of the stream of departures from the administration's upper ranks. former defense secretary jim mattis, who served as a marine general in iraq and afghanistan, resigned a year ago. trump has also gone through three national security advisers, including former lieutenant general michael flynn, former lieutenant general h.r. mcmaster and john bolton.
crocker also said he was sympathetic to a counterargument from the afghan president, who spread the blame more broadly.
it is very hard to disentangle the goal of reducing the overall numbers of immigrant arrivals from the goal of shifting our current ethnic and racial mix. but trump has now left little to no doubt that the real animating impulse is the latter.

grassley has also signed on to the creates act, whose house and senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) and former rep. beto o'rourke, who nearly beat cruz in the november midterms. the measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the creates act more in this health 202).
what's clear is that the supposedly obvious link between socialism and economic ruin doesn't check out. it's not just that it's easy to find counter examples of socialist governments that fail to set off economic collapse, like bolivia. it's also that catastrophe has more often than not come at the hand of committed anti-socialists. bouts of acute economic chaos ending in hyperinflation broke out in argentina, brazil, peru, and even in bolivia itself back in the 1980s, each time under centrist or right-wing governments deeply at odds with the socialist left.

former officials who worked with adeyemo and deese pointed out that neither worked at blackrock or other finance firms for long portions of their careers and said they believe it unlikely that they would have adopted the firm's views on financial regulation. adeyemo previously worked for now-sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), a frequent antagonist of wall street, at the consumer financial protection bureau. when he announced adeyemo's nomination, biden said he was highly recommended by warren.
speaking at trump's georgia rally, kelly loeffler – whose name appears on the ballot in today's runoff – became the 13th gop senator to publicly announce that she will oppose certifying biden's victory. she declared that she is going to try to get the legally certified electoral votes from her own state thrown out, as opposed to letting them be counted for biden. the effort will fail. but it is notable that loeffler is willing to effectively disenfranchise the 10.62 million people she is supposed to represent – since she has tied her political fortunes entirely to the lame-duck trump.
yet, while there is certainly an argument to be made for democrats to meet trump's hostage demands, make no mistake, this is trump's shutdown, and increasingly that of congressional republicans.
what we are witnessing now is the latest in a chain of unfounded questions about the legitimacy of our elections that has gone well beyond rooting out irregularities in voting. it began in 2005, when then-sen. barbara boxer (d-calif.) led a charge to overturn ohio's vote in favor of george w. bush. this impulse resumed in 2016, led by those who refused to accept donald trump's election. now, it has reached its apex, with the president and some of his supporters questioning the 2020 election without proof, only conspiracy and hearsay.

to see how this plays out, compare two theoretical borrowers in an income-driven repayment plan: lara and tonya. a single mom living with two kids, lara earns $50,000. under the most recent idr rules, her payments — regardless of loan size — would not exceed $1,742 per year. assuming that interest accrues at 4 percent, and that she is 15 years away from forgiveness, lara will fully repay her loan only if her balance is at or below $19,400. after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven; it makes no difference whether she borrowed $20,000 or $50,000.
that justification skips over the fact that the policy was controversial not just because of whom it targeted, but also the constitutionality of searching people who weren't accused of crimes. a federal judge struck it down in 2016 for that reason.
governing parties may also manipulate the rules to disadvantage the opposition. the most common example is gerrymandering — drawing election districts where the governing party is far more likely to win. a country is not a democracy when gerrymandering makes it all but impossible for the opposition to win national power.

in light of trump's apparent claim that he wants to prioritize people from countries such as norway, the uglier white nationalist cast of all of this is inescapable. trump's fellow travelers have gone to great lengths to obscure this basic reality. in a now-infamous exchange, cnn's jim acosta asked white house immigration hard-liner stephen miller whether trump's policies are designed to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country. miller reacted with outrage and repeatedly cast the goal as reducing the mere numbers of immigrants — ostensibly to protect u.s. workers from competition — which he said was in keeping with previous periods of lower immigration.
severino said the regulations are an outgrowth of trump's 2017 executive order that included a section on conscience protections. that order was seen as a direct response to some of the obama administration actions that upset religious conservatives.

when it comes to the success narrative for asian americans, guo wrote:
and yet the seemingly best approach — making young people feel enfranchised to deal with climate change — comes with both upsides and potential downsides. on the one hand, what better way for young people to process climate change worries than to pressure adults to actually do something about the crisis? campaigns like the youth-led sunrise movement, founded in 2017, have pursued this strategy, placing young people on the front lines of the fight over the green new deal; the group gained internet notoriety in february 2019 with a video of students, some as young as 11, confronting sen. dianne feinstein of california over her lack of support for the plan.
many of the adults i talked to said the heightened rhetoric around climate change reminded them of the panic around nuclear weapons during the cold war, when school lessons were interrupted by duck and cover drills and there was perpetual fear that the world might end at any moment. the 1983 tv movie the day after, which dramatized the fallout from a nuclear attack on the midwest, emerged as an apocalyptic touchstone; surveys after the film aired found viewers were more depressed about their chances of survival and were less optimistic about their ability to influence nuclear weapons policy.

what reality will look like is another question. we know that at least a few movies will be coming — warner bros. says it will make available all 17 of its scheduled films, including dune and in the heights, on hbo max, no matter how many theaters it can put them in. but that still leaves four other major studios, including every big movie from disney, in limbo.

prosecutors were becoming increasingly confident in their case. under pressure from the dea, sunrise had surrendered its license to distribute narcotics. the palm beach county sheriff's office had arrested schultz, charging him with drug trafficking and manslaughter because one of his patients died of a drug overdose. schultz was later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.
in august 2006, the dea issued a show-cause order asking mckesson, the nation's largest drug distributor, why its operations at the company's distribution center in lakeland, fla., should not be shut down. the dea alleged that three mckesson distribution centers filled hundreds of suspicious orders of hydrocodone, such as vicodin, placed by internet pharmacies.
meanwhile, the agency continues to struggle with an avalanche of package deliveries from the holiday season that have clogged up the mail stream, leaving prescription medications, bills, and even local newspapers sitting undelivered in postal facilities. the postal service delivered only 70.6 percent of first-class mail items on time during the week of dec. 12, the most recent data available, compared with better than 95 percent during the same period last year. (the postal service does not release data on package performance.)
diament said while bush refused to change the policy explicitly, his staff found ways to get many — not all — churches fema funds. the rules were applied flexibly he said, with the government focusing on the parts of houses of worship that could be characterized as not exclusively religious — like community halls that serve the homeless, for example.
foreign interference has again heightened the tension. americans have endured three years of criminal probes of the president for alleged foreign collusion. in response, trump and his allies have answered with calls to investigate the investigators — claiming that politically biased law enforcement officials spied on trump's campaign.

some kind of travel restriction on daegu citizens might have been helpful to contain the virus, but it was just out of the question, said choi eun-hwa, a professor of medicine at seoul national university and a member of an expert panel that met moon on monday. the south korean government can't afford to enforce that kind of restriction, as it would spark a huge backlash.

according to a 2015 u.n. study, the world is expected to have a population of about 8.5 billion people in 2030 — about a 15 percent increase in the size of humanity in just 15 years. india will have surpassed china to become the world's most populous nation, while demographers forecast a pronounced population surge in sub-saharan africa, which will soon be home to the world's most youthful societies. the number of megacities may double by the end of the decade, with close to two-thirds of humanity living in urban centers.
publishers are the most likely to take an initial hit from google's ad changes, said peter reinhardt, chief executive of the segment customer data platform. media companies have been more aggressive about the types of advertisements they use, he said, as google and facebook have tightened their hold on the digital ad industry. the two internet giants reaped 60 percent of the country's digital advertising dollars in 2017, according to the research firm emarketer.

i have a very distinctive beginning story, randy barnett told me over eggs at a diner in logan circle a few days before the society's annual national convention in november. there was no federalist society when i was a law student, so i didn't know anything about it. i heard about it, and my impression of it was it was going to be a very right-wing organization, and i'm a libertarian — i'm not a conservative.
but trump is wrong to claim this would be the biggest tax increase in history. when comparing revenue bills over many decades, percentage of the gross domestic product is the correct measure, not nominal dollars. calculations by the treasury department show that tax increases in 1941 and 1942 were a larger share of the economy. tax increases in 1951 and 1968 were also larger, but they were designed to be temporary and so are harder to compare to biden's proposed tax hike.

in the meantime, various panels have committed to do everything from release trump's tax returns to challenge his zero-tolerance border policy that has resulted in the separation of immigrant children from their parents, as well as their detention. those probes, however, are not expected to begin in earnest until later this month, after leaders have determined which members will sit on each committee — decisions panel leaders aren't expecting until later next week, due to leaders' immediate focus on ending the partial government shutdown.

pompeo: we didn't side with dictators, like the last administration. what a howler. in truth, the administration has based its middle east policy largely on siding with dictators in turkey, egypt, the united arab emirates and saudi arabia. even after saudi arabia's crown prince ordered the murder of a post contributing columnist, jamal khashoggi, trump and pompeo pushed ahead with a $500 million arms sale to saudi arabia. if this isn't appeasement— pompeo's favorite pejorative for the obama administration — then the word has no meaning.

congress will probably provide backpay for furloughed federal employees such as scheflen. but the likelihood of money in the future doesn't pay bills due today. backpay for low-wage contractors, like those who serve lunch in federal cafeterias, is less likely.
the tendency in feminist discussions of fat is often to encourage us to see the person who lives inside a fat body, or to focus on the social and genetic conditions that produce fat rather than the substance itself. those approaches are critically important to eliminating discrimination based on body size and advancing the policy goals that will get more people access to healthy food and appropriate medical care. but, as gay's writing suggests, these arguments don't achieve a confrontation with a contradiction at the heart of our thinking about fat: that we love the taste of something that disgusts us so much.

venezuela ran large budget deficits every year, even as oil prices skyrocketed between 2005 to 2014. that meant the country was piling on debt even as government revenue exploded — a senseless, pro-cyclical policy that left venezuela up a creek without a paddle when commodity prices tanked.

in normal times, restaurant and bar writers look for the new and different: breaking trends, hot chefs or bars that offer a vibe their neighbors don't. this inherent tendency to seek what's fresh and exciting is, i think, why businesses are so often praised and admired for pivoting to new models during the pandemic, when whiplash changes to menus and physical spaces are often born less of creative innovation than desperately trying to find a way for the business to stay afloat. for some, it was building a beer garden in the parking lot; for others, it was tossing out their critically acclaimed menus to make sandwiches and simpler fare.
musicians have been some of the most frequent users of the streaming platform, keeping their performance muscles strong while tours have been shut down. that development may fade as life slowly returns to normal, but instagram did recently announce that it's expanding live streams to a maximum of four hours instead of just one — so as we start the new year, much of our entertainment will still be found in the instagram app, just as it was for much of 2020.
two years later, trump's presidency is under siege following republican losses in the 2018 elections. an ongoing government shutdown, volatile financial markets, the special counsel probe, right-wing discontent over trump's failure to secure funding for a border wall, and empowered house democrats all loom before the president, who has been isolated and lashing out at his critics. the collision of threats has frayed the bonds between trump and some top republicans even as the president retains strong support in polls of party voters.

the evidence behind this theory is thin, however. many reporters and pundits are interpreting the russian government's indignation over the butina case — including the foreign ministry pushing a #freemariabutina hashtag and putin's own statements — to indicate moscow's intent to retaliate. others point to history, particularly the 1986 arrest of u.s. journalist nick daniloff on spying charges and the quick exchange for soviet diplomat gennady zakharov.

there's some irony in corporations have reined in the use of mobile phones in vehicles. hard-charging business people were among the first to see that drivetime didn't have to be downtime with a mobile phone in the car. some companies still shy away from imposing total bans for fear that productivity might suffer if employees couldn't take business calls in the car with a hands-free device.

the cruel irony of the pandemic is that, in times of social strife, black people have counted on the comforting rhythms of church life. but on this day there is no clapping from the amen corner, no church ladies in decorative hats filing in early to grab their favorite seats, no ushers rushing in with fans to cool parishioners who've been overwhelmed by the holy spirit. no little girls in their finest dresses scrounging through grandma's purse in search of hard peppermint candies, no little boys negotiating with the serving ladies for an extra piece of fried chicken or another dollop of potato salad after the second sermon.

some companies have great ideas, great management teams and compelling strategies. they invest heavily, seek to grow revenue, ignore the management of earnings and do limited stock buybacks. these are the criteria mckinsey uses to measure long termism. others lack vision and have mediocre management. they invest less, cut costs more, manage earnings and buy back stock. mckinsey deems them short-term focused.
president thaci and i spoke about the importance of making long-term decisions instead of reacting in the short term. i was pleased that he agreed and committed to work to end the tariffs that were recently imposed on serbian products, grenell said in a statement to the post. this move would help send the right signals that he is serious about negotiating and help build trust between the parties.

with that, carlson tossed out a year-old mo — playing the anti-anti-trump card, that is — and went straight after the president. the reason is that trump's remarkable flexibility bumped up against the closest thing that carlson has to a substantive core: a hard-line posture on all immigration issues. time and again, carlson has demagogued on such issues for his audience, whether the topic at hand is general immigrant crime, an alleged rape at a rockville, md., high school or the difficulties experienced by a pennsylvania community in living alongside a group of roma immigrants.

republicans, too, have worried about whether the president is listening to his advisers, warning him that the administration's actions in syria will affect the united states' reputation globally. at the time of trump's announcement, some wondered openly whether he was unduly influenced by foreign leaders such as erdogan, whose agenda in the region is somewhat different from that of the united states.

mitchell largely stayed out of the spotlight in the following weeks as legions of lawyers for the trump campaign failed in high-profile court cases across the country to get the election overturned. behind the scenes, however, her role had escalated to the point that when president trump on saturday made a last-ditch phone call to get raffensperger to find thousands of votes for him, it was the washington-based mitchell who emerged as a key player.

much — but not all — of the disparate-impact law could be changed by the administration because the concept was incorporated through regulations, which administrations are free to change by following a formal process. a broad-based rewrite of regulations could affect areas such as transportation and environmental law, as well as education and housing. but it would be harder to make changes to voting and employment law, experts say, because the concept of disparate impact is overtly written into the underlying statute, not just the regulations.

in a sense, manchin is the third big senate winner this week. assuming ossoff prevails, manchin is the presumptive next head of the chamber's energy and natural resources committee. his own vote is enough to swing power to a unified republican caucus if he wants. as a democrat in an overwhelmingly red state — and one who literally shot a copy of a carbon cap-and-trade bill in an ad for his first senate campaign — he isn't going to be onboard for anything like a green new deal. he has pointedly said he doesn't back abolishing the filibuster. at the same time, however, unless he plans on simply switching parties or giving up his committee chair, he can't simply step into senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's shoes and block everything biden and the more progressive elements of the party want to do.

democrats have typically elected more women than have republicans. because women generally hesitate to run for office more than men do, democrats and allied political organizations such as emily's list have worked to recruit and raise money for more female candidates. republicans have tended to reject identity politics, making it harder to sell donors on the need to elect more women. in fact, while most democratic donors are familiar with emily's list, republican donors generally do not know the various groups working to elect republican women; these groups raise far less money than does emily's list.

since the bill became law, the dea has issued no immediate suspension orders against manufacturers and one against a distributor in may 2018. the louisiana distributor, morris & dickson, denied the allegations, saying the dea failed to show any evidence of an immediate threat of death, serious bodily harm or abuse — the new standard in the marino bill that became law. two weeks later, the justice department rescinded the order.
if the only thing you do is wait for something the senate can pass, then what we might as well do is have the house recess for the next nine months, he said. allowing democrats to dictate immigration policy at a time of republican control of congress and the white house is distasteful and certainly not in keeping with what we promised the american people.
key components of the secret structure developed under bush are being swept away: the military's guantanamo bay, cuba, facility, where the rights of habeas corpus and due process had been denied detainees, will close, and the cia is now prohibited from maintaining its own overseas prisons. and in a broad swipe at the bush administration's lawyers, obama nullified every legal order and opinion on interrogations issued by any lawyer in the executive branch after sept. 11, 2001.
there also were reports of animals attacking passengers and crew members, as well as animals defecating in the passenger cabin. some questioned the legitimacy of such animals because unlike other service animals, many emotional support animals were not trained.
at various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their fica (payroll) tax. this, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the social security trust fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.

on march 17, the senate passed the measure by unanimous consent. the house followed weeks later. not one lawmaker opposed it.
whether older adults 'should' be high priority depends on what we want to achieve through a vaccination policy. and that involves value choices. distribution of covid-19 vaccines will need to maximize the public health benefits of the limited availability, or reduce the burden on the nhs, or save as many lives as possible from covid-19. these are not necessarily the same thing and a choice among them is an ethical choice.
march 1 steyer and buttigieg have dropped out. we've also adjusted the question on deportation efforts, which now centers only on the groups that would be the focus during a candidate's administration. we added a new question to the immigration survey about a temporary freeze on deportations.
but internally, bush administration officials shared anxieties and sounded alarms. in february 2005, rumsfeld forwarded a confidential report to secretary of state condoleezza rice about the afghan national police, or anp. the report was titled anp horror stories and described how most of the police were illiterate, underequipped and barely trained.
and yet making coalitions work is hard. the long list of challenges includes lopsided cooperation, fights over priorities and strategy, and even noticing common ground.

many eyes were already turned on the united states, as foreign observers tracked the closely contested runoff senate race in georgia. by wednesday afternoon, both democratic candidates, raphael warnock and jon ossoff, had been declared winners — tipping the senate to the democrats, thereby granting the party control of both the white house and congress.
for years, afghan commanders inflated the numbers so they could pocket salaries — paid by u.s. taxpayers — for no-show or imaginary personnel, according to u.s. government audits. as a result, washington now asks the afghans to produce biometric data, including fingerprints and face scans, to verify the existence of people in uniform.
trump has repeatedly railed against federal judges who have delayed projects on the grounds that officials have not conducted a thorough enough review under nepa.
beijing could generate goodwill by moving to open its markets more to foreign goods and investment, and trump could declare victory if he convinces a manufacturer here and there to relocate to some jobs from asia to the united states. but china's trade surplus is unlikely to vanish overnight.
under that program, which the trump administration calls the migrant protection protocols, nearly 50,000 migrants have been returned to mexico, many of them waiting months in dangerous border cities. trump officials say the program has been effective at deterring migrants who might be trying to game the system with baseless asylum claims.
the shutdown began after trump rejected bipartisan congressional efforts to fund many operations through feb. 8, insisting that any deal must contain wall money. his demand infuriated many republicans who had been working to avoid a shutdown, but most have followed his lead and are insisting democrats broker some sort of compromise.
the 2015 clip from a speech he gave at the aspen institute might be the starkest example. it isn't new — audio was released in real time by a reporter for the aspen times — but it is newly relevant. here's what bloomberg said:
other international agreements to which iran has committed itself also prohibit the development of such weapons. iran also has agreed to let international monitors peer closely into its nuclear activities. the trump and obama administrations have both certified that iran was meeting its jcpoa commitments.
federal officials had estimated 20 million doses of the coveted vaccine would be delivered and administered by the end of 2020. adams pointed to a strain on resources brought on by the nationwide surge in covid-19 cases and by the holidays as possible causes of the slower-than-expected rollout, while president trump has blamed states.

morhaim says he has steered clear of legislation affecting the medical marijuana industry during the current legislative session. busch has removed him from the house committee that considers bills affecting the health-care industry.
for us, marching is a tactic, a tactic that met the moment, at the time, said rachel o'leary carmona, executive director of the women's march, when she described the energy and momentum of that day in 2017 when thousands of marchers overwhelmed d.c. in a sea of pink the day after trump took office.

he winds his way through a stump speech with the same inflections and cadences of a southern preacher. the call-and-response includes melodic repetition of the line who are we? imploring the audience to answer we, the people. resting one arm against the lectern while looking off to the side, he delivers rehearsed dad jokes, pleas for voter turnout and broadsides against his political opponent. the preacher sprinkles his calls for affordable health care with biblical allusions, reminding voters that bartimaeus, a blind man healed by jesus in the gospel of mark, suffered from a preexisting condition. to this point, warnock testifies on the need for medicaid expansion and cheaper college tuition. audience members punctuate the applause lines with cries of c'mon, rev!
for starters, only about 2 in 10 afghan recruits could read or write. u.s. and nato trainers put them through crash literacy courses, but those lasted only a few weeks.
a national system of free and reliable broadband would have widespread benefits. it would enable businesses to reach more consumers, educational resources to reach more americans, and employers to reach a greater pool of workers — boosting the economy and making the u.s. more competitive. it's hard to imagine a more worthwhile investment of taxpayer dollars.
the teaser clip for the sissi interview shows the egyptian leader denying a human rights watch claim that 60,000 people have been thrown in jail for their political beliefs since the former defense minister seized power in 2014 by overthrowing egypt's first freely elected president, mohamed morsi of the muslim brotherhood.

the whole idea of the law is to give better information in advance to decision-makers and the public. it appears that these changes are an effort to undermine both of those purposes of the statute, caputo said. it would basically make the federal government become an ostrich, sticking its head in the ground rather than thinking about the environmental impact of its actions.

rising demand for walkable places near jobs, metro and suburban town centers has meant rising prices, threatening the ability of even affluent families to find a good place to live. our most vulnerable residents face even steeper hurdles as cheaper rental housing disappears under market pressures.
the sad irony of these fears is that neither reason for keeping gay americans from working in intelligence was based in reality. never in american history was there a recorded case of a gay person compromised by a foreign power due to fears of his or her sexual orientation being exposed. the more realistic scenario was that exemplified by anti-communist newspaper columnist joe alsop in 1957. when the kgb entrapped him having sex with another man in a moscow hotel room, alsop marched straight to the american embassy and composed a statement acknowledging the incident and his homosexuality. years later, when incriminating photographs of the encounter were mailed anonymously across washington, alsop refused to desist in his harsh criticisms of the soviet regime.

great leaders know how to say hard things without wounding the innocent or stimulating dark hearts. trump's instinct for the jugular may have served him well in the dealmaking meatgrinder of his native queens, but most people in main street america prefer to get along and leave well enough alone. trump has managed to make enemies of neighbors and divide families along partisan lines.
being a dog owner changes your children's poop. in fact, just by looking at a kid's feces, scientists can tell whether there's a pooch at home.
one example is cardinal francisco javier errázuriz, former archbishop of santiago, chile, elevated by francis to the elite, nine-member council of cardinal advisers, a sort of papal kitchen cabinet in rome. errázuriz has long been accused of ignoring accusations of sexual abuse against a priest under his jurisdiction. another is cardinal george pell, formerly an australian bishop, who serves as the vatican's top finance official. he has long been accused of having shrugged off pedophilia among priests during his time in australia. when questioned about it last year by an investigative commission in his home country, he fell back on the old canard about the church being no better or worse than society at large, a facile formulation often used by vatican officials to avoid any admission of the church's ingrained pattern of institutional complicity.
emotions run high in this partisan environment, and given everything our president has unfairly endured, it is easy to understand why so many of his supporters think the election may have been stolen. but the choice before us now is to accept the results of the november election, or to object and undermine not only the president but also the institutions that define us as a free people.
i remembered a friend once had some success with a diet in which he didn't let himself eat after 8 p.m. that time didn't work for my lifestyle, so i modified it: whenever i ate for the last time in the evening, i wouldn't eat again for 12 hours. (i later learned that a version of this was an actual plan called the buddha's diet, but at the time i just thought i was a genius.)

what could happen next? north carolina republicans, who now say that harris should be seated, are sticking with him and filing lawsuits on his behalf, attempting to move the matter to federal court. but if they lose there, a law passed by the republican-run legislature would mandate any vacancy to be filled in a special election, preceded by a primary. one potential timeline: both parties pick their nominees in a late spring primary, then elect a new congressman as late as november.

to that end, writers patty jenkins (who also directed) and geoff johns introduce maxwell lord, who absorbs the power of a rock that grants wishes, but exacts a price — at least, sometimes. where previous entries in the dc expanded universe pondered weightier ideas about what it would mean for mortal men to realize gods walk among them — and wonder woman, in turn, asked how gods would react to the realization that men have free will — this film's message is a more mundane you can't always get what you want or be careful what you wish for.
mccain is, of course, completely correct. among the world's 41 wealthiest countries, the united states is the only one that doesn't mandate paid leave — leagues behind top-ranking estonia, hungary and the other countries that offer more than a year. paid parental leave is good for families, good for children and good for working parents, and america's failure on this matter is so self-evident that we don't need to spend more than this one paragraph emphasizing it. meghan mccain is one thousand percent right.
the women's march is in some ways already there. it erupted after a peculiarly competitive election. moving at a moment when the political chess board is in disarray gave the march prominence and power. whether any emerging demands are met depends less on whether the march changed public opinion than on whether its successor movement can give elites more reasons to move to its side.
china's secrecy during the outbreak circumvented the who's ability to declare a public health emergency, which is a useful tool in coordinating countries' response to the spread of an infectious disease. when it was finally contained, sars had infected more than 8,000 people in 30 countries across the world and killed 774 people worldwide, according to the cdc.

henricks said he didn't notice trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. i think [the trump era is] changing clearly the character of the republican party, he said. some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less republican.
this week, trump also asked for the resignation of john c. rood, the official in charge of defense department policy, who had certified that ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations required by law to receive u.s. aid that trump froze.
trump received a polite but not enthusiastic reception in the hall.

going by past pandemics, this data won't start showing up for a while. when it does, it will likely vary by country, which affects how liability is handled. in 2013, four years after swine flu hit the globe, the u.k. government reversed its stand on the safety of the pandemrix jab made by glaxosmithkline plc, after a major study showed that it was associated with narcolepsy. affected individuals could apply for compensation. at the time, the health department noted that the decision to recommend that children got this vaccine during the flu pandemic was based on evidence available at the time, along with the advice from the european medicines agency which approved its use. it then said that the department keeps all emerging evidence under review, which is why usage stopped in 2011 for those under 20. the data evolves, muddying potential liability issues.

in january 2018, the department wrote to miracle hill, stating that its christians-only policy ran afoul of a federal regulation finalized by the department of health and human services in the closing days of the obama administration. that regulation was spurred by complaints about discrimination against potential foster parents on the grounds of religion and, separately, sexual orientation, according to one person involved. the rules bar such discrimination in all hhs programs.
what don't we know? well, for the first time since 2004, democrats have a wide-open primary field with no establishment favorite, and not much of an establishment to decide on one. the 2008 and 2016 primaries eventually settled into battles between clinton, representing the old party leadership, and a candidate who could define himself as a change agent. some democrats see joe biden potentially filling that establishment role, but none see him consolidating party support the way clinton did.

övp and fpö also want to begin charging students for attending universities — right now, austria's public universities are mostly free — although that might be offset with tax exemptions after graduation. they want to ratify ceta, a controversial economic agreement between the european union and canada, and to gut the chamber of labor, a statutory interest group with compulsory membership for austrian employees.

the genesis for this belief lay in the career of col. alfred redl. a gay man and senior counterintelligence official in the austro-hungarian army, redl was caught selling secrets for a hefty sum to russia in 1913. redl's motivation was pure greed; his homosexuality was not even known to his russian handler, nor would its exposure necessarily have ruined a military career in late belle époque vienna. however, hoping to downplay the embarrassment of a mole at the very top of its counterintelligence apparatus, the military leaked that redl was gay and had been blackmailed by the russians over it.

here's an example of how chinese regulators and courts exert influence over global markets, with so many multinational corporations doing significant business in china. the state administration for market regulation showed china's tight regulatory fist by delaying the merger between two rival chipmakers: qualcomm, a u.s. company whose china business accounted for nearly two-thirds of its revenue in 2017, and nxp of the netherlands. the deal would have increased qualcomm's competitiveness in the internet of things, including connected cars.

still, it's not all bad, and wonder woman 1984 is at its best when most rooted in its location. unlike many hollywood productions, the movie uses actual d.c. locations for both interior and exterior shots. watching wonder woman stride through the iconic smithsonian national museum of natural history's entry and take a resurrected steve on a tour of d.c.'s metro system gave the picture a genuine washington flair so often absent from movies like this. big setpieces that take place on actual washington streets in sight of the capitol — and overhead during the city's annual fireworks extravaganza — as well as the use of more intimate locations such as the watergate's apartment complexes, help make the movie's use of places such as the reflecting pool feel natural, rather than hastily added to remind audiences where they are.

despite the excitement surrounding the deal, it's not clear whether this marks a clear break with past taliban policy. the taliban's policies toward girls' education remain inconsistent and somewhat unpredictable — local commanders' approaches vary by personality and according to their relationship with the local community. as a teacher in wardak province explained, today, [a taliban official] tells you that they allow girls up to sixth grade, but tomorrow, when someone else comes instead, he might not like girls' education.

thursday, april 1, 1999; page a1 the warnings were there for president clinton. for weeks before the nato air campaign against yugoslavia, sources said, cia director george j. tenet had been forecasting that serb-led yugoslav forces might respond by accelerating their campaign of ethnic cleansing in the province of kosovo – precisely the outcome that has unfolded over the past week. all during this time, u.s. military leaders were offering clinton a corresponding assessment of their own. if the serbs did launch such an assault, they said, air power alone would not be sufficient to stop it – precisely the analysis that nato's supreme commander, gen. wesley k. clark, articulated publicly this week when asked what the military could do to halt the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the balkans. but in the face of this advice, according to a variety of u.s. and european sources familiar with the decision-making, clinton and his senior white house advisers pressed on with their planning for an air campaign. the group, participants said, never reassessed the fundamental judgment they had reached the previous fall, which ruled out the use of ground troops as a way of protecting kosovo's majority albanian population from a brutal crackdown by the serbs. that judgment, which several administration officials said was arrived at easily and with little internal dissent, is now at the core of what could count as the most serious foreign policy crisis of clinton's presidency.
i hope mike is going to do the right thing. i hope so. i hope so, because if mike pence does the right thing, we win the election, trump said. all vice president pence has to do is recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.
this week, house democrats will vote on four separate appropriations bills, starting with funding the treasury department and the internal revenue service. the longer the shutdown goes, the greater the chance that americans' tax refunds will be delayed. the democrats' gambit here is that republicans won't be able to explain to their voters why they couldn't reopen the irs to ensure the on-time delivery of refund checks, which is unrelated to the fight over border security.

we play tonight's game with a heavy heart after yesterday's decision in kenosha, and knowing that protesters in our national's capital are treated differently by political leaders depending on what side of certain issues they are on, the statement read. the drastic different between the way protesters this past spring and summer were treated and the encouragement given to today's protesters who acted illegally just shows how much more work we have to do.

for exercise, i would walk. i was already a slave to my step tracker. i had a daily goal of 10,000 steps — about five miles — so i decided i wanted to end the year with at least 3.66 million steps: my daily goal times 366. (it was a leap year!) because it was late april and i hadn't been strict, i would have to average more than 10,000 the rest of the way. that made it a challenge.

with most of the country already under extreme measures, it's clear that we need to do more together to bring this new variant under control while our vaccines are rolled out, prime minister boris johnson said monday. in england, we must, therefore, go into a national lockdown which is tough enough to contain this variant.

but a border wall is 'central to any strategy,' vought wrote, and democrats — who have said the wall should not be tied to an agreement to reopen the government — remained skeptical of any overtures by the president, suggesting that there is no end in sight to the shutdown, which has entered its third week. a democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the white house hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.
the usda is working to finalize a new rule that would make the increased line speeds permanent and expand them to other poultry plants, although it is unclear if the administration will be able to push the change through before joe biden takes office. critics worry that such a rule change could harm worker safety even beyond the coronavirus. carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other illnesses are common among people who work in meatpacking plants.

second, the establishment isn't operating the way it used to. one of the great paradoxes of the last democratic primary season is that the forces that lost — supporters of sanders — routed the forces that won. for more than a year, they fought for, and won, changes to the democratic primary rules that eliminated the voting power of superdelegates on the first ballot at any convention. at the same time, they won commitments from the democratic national committee that set up earlier debates and prioritized candidates with grassroots fundraising. the rules that infuriated sanders supporters in 2016, allowing clinton to build a huge delegate lead before facing her opponents, have been overturned.

a signature line of trump's rallies is that he only once ran for political office — for president — and he won. (that's not true, as he briefly sought the reform party nomination in 2000.) here, he's trying to adjust his line by falsely claiming he won the second election — even though he lost.

i think it is important that we have people in politics on the liberal side, on the progressive side, that represent faith, that take back the meaning behind faith, that it is not a conservative ideal, says alex moreschi, a white episcopal minister. at its heart, christianity is a progressive movement. it is a radical movement for the health and security and love of neighbor. and i see rev. warnock representing that.

the more pressing obstacle, however, is turkey. syria's economy and especially its war-ravaged second city, aleppo, would be greatly boosted by reopening routes into turkey — currently blocked by both ankara and the turkish-backed rebels controlling idlib. though turkey has dropped demands for assad to go, three contested areas prevent reconciliation.

this brings me to the question i'm often asked and that i sometimes ask myself: how could republicans, christians, evangelicals and other good people support someone such as trump, especially as he threatened our democratic republic by denying the 2020 election results? what could sens. josh hawley (r-mo.) and ted cruz (r-tex.) be thinking in joining his crusade to reverse the election's results — that is, other than their own 2024 presidential campaigns and their craven desire to appeal to trump's loyal base?

(for whatever it's worth, this message was sent to me several hours before elan journo's post about the incident went up, and to my knowledge it wasn't prompted by any existing or impending news coverage.) the letter was sent to the institute that wednesday morning (the 15th). the institute in turn promptly responded with a gracious acknowledgment, which also noted that [a]part from the incident the event went smoothly and was successful, with the audience inside the room [being] lively, engaged and respectful of the speakers; and the institute praised the federalist society student chapter for its work promoting the event (which particularly pleased me, since i'm the chapter's adviser).
most of our respondents recognized the need for sexual expression and the desire of residents to have intimate relationships. yet the day-to-day reality restricted opportunities for intimacy. this happened in two broad ways: surveillance of resident behavior and justification for limiting sexual freedom. surveillance was subtle and nuanced in ways that limited sexual expression.

an effective covid-19 relief package can't be an exotic band-aid. it needs to do more than support the economy for weeks or months. it should help lay the foundations for profitable and productive companies and a more prosperous workforce. this will require considerable investment in high-quality education, infrastructure and public health, and a more expansive safety net for vulnerable americans.

we have people that know the power of fear manipulate consciously the psychology of young people in a way that is wrong and should stop, he argues. what people need to understand is that there are extreme scenarios ... and they are not the same thing as predictive science. indeed, scientists say that while some warming is baked in, action now could avert the worst consequences. marvel puts it this way: there are so many futures between doomed and fine.
nancy pelosi and chuck schumer care more about the radical left than keeping us safe, a narrator says. the consequences? drug deaths. violent murder. gang violence. we must not allow it. that's followed by trump himself saying that liberals care more about illegal immigrants than americans.
the alphabet workers union will have an elected board of directors and paid organizing staff members, according to the group's news release. members will pay 1 percent of total compensation, which includes salary and equity. a representative declined to say how many of the 230 or so members are full-time employees versus contractors.

there are two likely scenarios. in one, the virus quiets down, thanks to the vaccine, a few months into the year. people quickly feel comfortable returning to theaters (and enough of those theaters hang on until then), and the rest of 2021 is a bonanza, a cinematic splashdown the likes of which the world has never seen.
they're also staring down rate increases of as much as 9 percent in 2022 and for years thereafter. mail service is already one of their biggest costs, industry insiders say, and such a scenario could force hundreds of small publications out of business given their already bite-size margins.

three things happened in 2008 that shocked the republican system. the first was that the presidency of george w. bush was increasingly seen as a failure, even by many republicans. by early october of that year, his approval among members of his party was under 60 percent in gallup polling, a staggeringly low figure by recent standards. that was in part due to the downturn that was still burning through the economy, a downturn that destabilized the sense of security of even the most financially stable americans. those two things contributed to the election of barack obama, a manifestation of another cultural change in the country: the decreasing dominance of whites.

— on the front lines of the app wars. the post's brian fung: a growing number of software companies are looking to bypass the dominant app store gatekeepers at apple and google — selling their services directly to consumers and undercutting the tech giants that for years have controlled how most of iphone and android users discover, download and pay for their apps.
instead of a mandate and a fine if people don't sign up for insurance, the bill would create a continuous coverage requirement that would penalize people who have a gap in their coverage. anyone who lets their insurance coverage lapse could experience a 30 percent premium hike the next time they sign up.

a glowing 1996 new yorker profile of her after she arrived in washington, headlined the outsider, described her as having given up the pursuit of elected office and setting herself as a leader of antipolitical action. the story quoted her as saying she used to be a social liberal who would sit in the state capitol thinking of all the good things i could do with other people's money but eventually turned against what she called our entitlement mentality.
at the heart of the issue is a philosophical problem that has bedeviled the west (where individual liberties remain far more important than in asia) throughout the long months of the pandemic. at the risk of oversimplification, it is the battle between the ideas represented by immanuel kant and john stuart mill.
yes, he's getting support from african american voters — so far, anyway — but they already vote at relatively high rates, comparable to white voters. the big untapped potential for democrats lies in young people and latinos, neither of whom seems particularly jazzed about a biden nomination.

the number of cases of coronavirus in the united states now stands at nearly five dozen, a figure that greatly increased when infected passengers were brought back from the diamond princess cruise ship, docked in japan. the federal government has had to scramble in recent weeks to adjust, and the white house's coronavirus response has been uneven, with president trump recently expressing anger that he was not involved in more decisions. while traveling in india on monday, trump declared on twitter that the coronavirus is very much under control in the united states and that the stock market was looking good.
the subpoena brought a windfall of information. the dea gained access to data from mallinckrodt's rebate or chargeback program, an industry-wide practice that provides reimbursements to wholesale distributors. that information and other records showed where mallinckrodt's oxycodone was going — from the company to its network of distributors to retailers down the chain.

link copied link defense minister says no decision on pulling canadian troops from iraq, calls situation 'complex' toronto — canadian defense minister harjit sajjan said monday that no decision has been made to pull canadian troops from iraq and stressed the need for de-escalation in the region. in a television interview with the canadian broadcasting corp., sajjan said that the iraqi parliament's decision to pass a nonbinding resolution calling on all foreign troops to leave the country created a complex situation. we know the current situation is now far more complicated, and we have to accept their process, he said, but it is more complicated than just one vote. canada has hundreds of military personnel in iraq as part of both the nato mission and the global coalition fighting the islamic state. it has suspended both of those missions, but sajjan said he hopes they will continue. he told the cbc that canada has taken the appropriate steps for force protection in iraq and that some nonessential personnel have been moved out of the country in the wake of soleimani's killing. asked if u.s. officials had given canada notice of their plan to kill the iranian general, sajjan said that canada had an indication something was going to happen but did not know what was going to happen. in a television interview on monday with ctv news, sajjan condemned iran's actions in the region but would not comment on whether he thought soleimani's killing was legal.
of course, trade and national security are arguably not either-or choices, but are often interlinked. indeed, china's large trade surplus is one reason it has been able to extend its influence across asia and the rest of the world, in ways that have clear national security implications for the united states. yet robb's argument does yield interesting insights, so let's run with it a little further.

such transparency enables the public to be informed about some of the most important policy choices the government makes in its name — ones that involve life and death decisions, the letter says.
i found some clues during the three days of the national convention at the mayflower hotel that bookended the gala. the judges project is still clearly in high gear, and with two sitting supreme court justices in their 80s — ruth bader ginsburg, 85, and stephen breyer, 80 — there's an incentive to keep the list of candidates fresh. numerous candidates-in-waiting were on display at the conference. i counted 24 appeals court judges on the program — including 15 just elevated by trump — and at least 11 of the names on trump's expanded list of potential supreme court nominees were scheduled to participate over the three days.
president-elect joe biden promises a grand restoration of american leadership on the world stage. as soon as he enters the white house, he will try to reverse some of the havoc wreaked by president trump abroad. he'll rescind the u.s. withdrawal from the world health organization, return to the paris climate accords and start salvaging the nuclear deal with iran.
this bill helps keep the vast information stored by the federal government secure from hackers by making clear that the federal cio is in charge of the security of our data across the government, hurd said in a statement. the legislation passed the house unanimously in the previous congress in november but did not advance in the senate.
the forest conservation act was never intended to be a no-net-loss tool, by itself, he said.
still, most bills require 60 senate votes to pass. since the democrats' wins in georgia give them a 50-50 split, ties will need to be broken with a vote from vice president-elect kamala d. harris. so biden will have to rely on his self-proclaimed talent for compromise to achieve many of his prized goals, especially following wednesday's riot and its suggestion that the country's political passions are not fading anytime soon.
the dea would later call the guidelines important for guarding against diversion of pain pills.
correct: trump on tuesday allowed white house reporters to hang out at a bipartisan immigration discussion with capitol hill lawmakers. the session impressed the living hyperbolights out of daytime cable television. i'm sure i will get hit for this and i don't really care, said cnn chief political correspondent dana bash on the cable network. the bottom line is that this is, a year ago, this is the presidency that many people thought donald trump was capable of.
when it comes to planned parenthood, the house and senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. under president barack obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from planned parenthood and other abortion clinics; trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.

progress in diversifying boardrooms, along with workplaces generally, has been evolutionary. the civil rights act of 1964, which banned employment discrimination, was attacked at the time as radical overreach. today, it's bedrock employment law — a common-sense baseline. the nasdaq measure, once approved, should be similarly regarded.

in response to the policy changes, baltimore housing officials reworked their plans. still emphasizing choice, the housing authority skirted around the requirements. instead of one wait list with applicants placed in projects as openings became available, baltimore successfully lobbied to divide their housing projects into four geographic areas. in a highly segregated city like baltimore, geographic areas could — and did — serve as a proxy for race.

the ruling amounts to a rebuke of trump's stated preference for filling top administration jobs with officials serving in an acting capacity. the president has said he prefers having top officials in an acting role because he thinks it makes them easier to remove than those with senate confirmation.

kasich, who spent months campaigning in new hampshire ahead of the 2016 primary, where he placed second a distant second to trump, has been frank about that political reality and the uphill climb any trump challenger would face.
it's easy to see the line from older conspiracy theories to the fact-free claims by trump supporters today. white house adviser stephen miller has drawn anti-immigration rhetoric from white-nationalist publications like the 1973 french novel the camp of the saints, which envisions hordes of immigrants obliterating western civilization. breitbart news has featured anti-immigrant, anti-gay and anti-black theories that could have been found in an earlier generation of far-right publications, including american opinion and american mercury.
and now house democrats have tweaked rules around paying for legislation, potentially making it easier for their members to pass bills if they can be reasonably seen as related to the coronavirus pandemic or climate change.
why do the political parties tend to reelect leaders despite persistent opposition from their ranks? parties make a critical trade-off. they empower strong leaders to advance the party's agenda. but those leaders are then harder to remove because they can exploit the position's powers to buy off dissenting party members and keep the job.

trump has complained that he endorsed romney in both 2012 for president and 2018 for senate and that romney has taken every chance he can to hurt him, including an op-ed attacking the president soon after he joined the senate in early 2019. trump met with romney after he won the election in 2016, and advisers said he was considering him for secretary of state — though he was never likely to get the nomination.

when investigators and courts incorporate disparate impact in a review, they are looking at more than the intent of laws or practices. they are also evaluating whether a policy's impact varies based on race, ethnicity or other factors. regulations across the government implementing the 1964 civil rights act and its amendments define discrimination as including this unintentional form of bias.

feb. 24, 2019, issue: it has become a familiar refrain in american life: we're sending our thoughts and prayers. it's a go-to line for politicians and other dignitaries following a national tragedy. but is it heartfelt? in the eyes of some — with the increasing rate of gun violence and little to no legislation to minimize it — the phrase has come to be synonymous with inaction. rather than filling theoretical boxes with empty gestures, says artist jon krause, those thoughts would better serve our country if applied toward tangible, collaborative solutions.
if he gives in now, that's the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president, said sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.) on wednesday during an interview with sean hannity of fox news. that's probably the end of his presidency. donald trump has made a promise to the american people: he's going to secure our border.
the who declared a public health emergency of international concern just days after a case was discovered near rwanda. the obama administration responded to the outbreak in an unprecedented way, ordering thousands of soldiers to west africa to assist in treatment. the who argued that a travel ban would negatively affect the countries of west africa. from 2014 to 2016, 11 americans who contracted the disease were treated, while 11,000 people across that region and the congo died due to the epidemic.
some antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. still others say that trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other gop presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.
in virginia, people with medical conditions that the centers for disease control and prevention say are proven to increase the severity of coronavirus infections, including cancer, chronic kidney disease and certain heart conditions, are currently eligible for vaccinations. the virginia department of health says many of those individuals will be offered the vaccine through their health care providers.
responding to a question from sen. christopher a. coons (d-del.) about trump's apparent public solicitation of compromising materials on his campaign rivals from russia and china, white house deputy counsel patrick philbin ventured a sweeping defense of the president's remarks — claiming they did not, in fact, represent a violation of campaign finance laws that make it illegal to accept or solicit a thing of value from foreign sources.
you enjoying everything so far? gardner asked as the two waited for an elevator.
ah, she could do without it.
eight of the 10 u.s. counties reporting the largest per capita increases in their caseloads are small, rural georgia counties.
still, combining a deft touch and an unrelenting lobbying blitz, it has kept policymakers at bay and been allowed to continue growing.
the longer the shutdown goes on, the worse the ripple effect on the economy and for average americans. if political pressure mounts, congressional republicans could lean on trump to reopen the government without border wall funding. in this scenario, he'd probably fight for an assurance from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) that the senate gop would prioritize border security in the immediate aftermath. then, if the senate reached a compromise on border wall funding and a permanent fix to the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, or daca, it's conceivable that pelosi might feel an incentive to push something through the house. if trump thought this was possible, he could cave and sign a clean bill to reopen the government. but the president has rejected similar suggestions from republicans such as sen. lindsey o. graham (s.c.).
as sen. tom cotton (r-ark.), another conservative who has stood against the herd, put it: the founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states — not congress. they entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the electoral college — not congress. and they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts — not congress. under the constitution and federal law, congress's power is limited to counting electoral votes submitted by the states.
so what is actually going on? here's a rundown.
those who choose to stay, and i have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they're worried the president might put someone worse in, mulvaney said on cnbc's squawk box. he added that trump was not the same as he was eight months ago.
two months later, on feb. 18, 2014, marino and blackburn introduced legislation on capitol hill that would redefine the law regulating suspicious orders filled by drug companies.
we stand ready to assist your efforts to reach an agreement that balances the interests of both kosovo and serbia. such an agreement is within reach. i look forward to hosting you and president aleksandar vucic at the white house to celebrate what would be an historic accord, the letter to thaci read.
meger primarily sells gold two ways: physical gold in bars and, secondly, through futures contracts in which the buyer agrees to take ownership of a specified amount of gold some time in the future at a set price.
helle said his message remained the same.
she connected issues that galvanize the left under the idea that america's political and economic system is corrupt — the precise word used in 2016 by both trump and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) — and that is preventing working-class families from getting ahead.
sanders, too, seems to exist in the american imagination independent from his jewishness. take the myriad articles exploring his popularity among latinos, many of whom call him tío bernie, the articles tell us, despite the fact that he is a white, 78-year-old senator from vermont. the mystery these articles seek to solve is never how young latinos could identify with an old jew or even an old white jew, but how they could identify with an old white guy and how they came to claim him as one of their own. the narrative erases sanders's jewish identity.

and then came president trump, along with press secretary sean spicer. on his first day in the briefing room, spicer lambasted the assembled media for allegedly misreporting inauguration crowds — an attack based on well-exposed falsehoods — and then left the lectern without taking questions. in one appearance, spicer combined access problems with something new: an official white house policy of media hostility on a level with no parallel in modern memory.
the blueprint overall is just that: a starting framework. one promising idea calls for increased pricing transparency, a popular idea among insulin-access activists that has also been gaining ground in state legislatures. the blueprint also recommends bringing more generic drugs onto the market. right now, the united states has two relatively new follow-on insulins, which are similar to generics, but they are only marginally cheaper. some experts say more competition is needed to lower prices. in december, fda commissioner scott gottlieb issued a statement on policies that will put more generics on the u.s. market, including for insulin starting in 2020, as part of a transition that was written into the affordable care act. we've heard frequent reports of patients rationing insulin, and in some cases dying because they can't afford the injections they need to survive, the statement read. these tragic stories aren't isolated occurrences. and they're not acceptable for a drug that's nearly a century old.
when title ix was passed, i was quite naive, dr. sandler said. i thought all the problems of sex discrimination in education would be solved in one or two years at most. when two years passed, i increased my estimate to five years, then later to 10, then to 50, and now i realize it will take many generations to solve all the problems.
pentagon and state department officials are skeptical that turkish forces are capable of combating the islamic state, whose reduced forces are now far into southern syria near the iraqi border, or that turkey will prioritize the militants over its stated desire to eliminate the kurdish ypg forces.
biden has been at pains to stress bipartisanship and ignore the growing chorus of wing-nuttery from the hard right challenging his election victory. but kevin book of clearview energy partners, a washington-based research firm, detects signs of this cracking. in his pre-runoff speech on monday in georgia, biden criticized trump's efforts to assert, take or seize power over the will of the electorate and also the incumbent republican senators in the state for backing him up. book also highlights biden's use of the phrase national emergency when introducing his climate team last month, headed by gina mccarthy. while that may have been just a throwaway line from a politician known for his syntactical throwing arm, it may also signal a willingness to resort to emergency powers to address climate change if he believes there is simply no deal to be had with republicans. after all, trump considered using such powers to force utilities to buy electricity from his favorite nuclear and coal-fired plants in the name of national security.
virginia law already allows adults to give handguns to someone under age 18, as long as the child is a family member or it's for the purpose of engaging in a sporting event or activity. it prohibits those types of knives, however, and stuart was proposing to change the language to mirror guns.
some state officials acknowledge that possibility.
in britain, a study published last year in the international journal of drug policy found that 20 percent of all drugs sold at a randomly chosen 2016 festival contained substances other than the ones dealers had declared.
shannon minter, legal director of the national center for lesbian rights, called the decision cursory and misinformed and said it rests on the utter fiction that this ban is not a ban. every other court has immediately understood that when you say you can serve only if you serve in your birth sex, that is a ban. it is dangerous and irresponsible.

what's good for the goose is good for the gander. the bottom line is that that order is very, very controversial, hoyer said. it's going to be i think a very, very political, patently political, swamp political, to do something for the governor of florida — who's a republican — and not do something for governors who have similar concerns.
the administration issued a series of warnings to russia. in one instance, a senior aide recounted a conversation in china when obama told putin that we knew what he was doing and [he] better stop or else.

governments are expected to spend nearly $13 trillion to help their countries recover from the pandemic, offering an unprecedented chance to fund research on green technology and transition away from fossil fuels. if stimulus packages are invested the right way, the international energy agency has found, they could trim expected 2030 emissions by as much as 25 percent. not since the end of world war ii has society seen such an opportunity to reinvent itself.
that does not mean that the dream of the modern left will become law this year. but advocates know that. rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.), the sponsor of the house legislation, said having public hearings and traditional scoring for the bill will elevate it as a 2020 issue.
-- trump's trade war is increasingly disrupting u.s. factory operations as more firms contemplate moving elsewhere. the new york times's peter s. goodman reports: in the united states, factories that buy steel and aluminum — now more expensive — are struggling to pass on extra costs to their customers. some are losing orders to overseas competitors that can buy metal free of american tariffs. companies that import electronics and other parts are scrambling to remain profitable while exploring alternatives, such as moving plants beyond reach of the duties. … the tariffs have been sold to americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the united states, abandoning china, mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. but the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.
one set of proposed regulations takes effect on the eve of inauguration day and covers a broad swath of faith-based social service programs in nine agencies — the departments of education, homeland security, agriculture, justice, labor, veterans affairs, health and human services, housing and urban development, and the agency for international development.
a second order to show cause went to a mckesson facility in landover, md., in november 2007. that month, cardinal had its license suspended at its center in auburn, wash. the dea alleged the company had supplied 18 million doses of hydrocodone in nine months to retail pharmacies, including one filling illegitimate prescriptions.
the herald's investigation prompted the t's transit police agency to conduct a year-long crackdown. that year, the t received 68,500 filed claims — less than half from the year before. and of those filed claims, 30 percent were debunked and denied. from the herald:
there would be plenty of time for more activism, but today was meant for those who knew alec best. at dusk, brittany handed out sparklers and roman candles, and the crowd gathered in a circle on the grass. they launched the fireworks into big bursts of yellow and green, with sparks and ash raining down over the yard. it had been a hard day, but it was still a party. nicole stood on the deck to record the scene on a cellphone as friends and family called out: happy birthday, alec! we love you! we miss you. everyone stared up at the sky, watching until the last flare burned out.
bitcoin also tumbled: the cryptocurrency briefly dipped below $30,000 monday, just two days after breaching that level for the first time, cnbc's ryan browne reports.
it was a shock for many people in the district, including, apparently, antwan wilson, the chancellor who has been running the district for about a year and said he didn't know anything about the practices that sparked the scandal.
it is unclear whether the trump administration will do more than publicly call out moscow for the hacks. in past cases involving cyberespionage, the united states has refrained from doing so on the grounds that the offending spy agency was doing what all nations with such capabilities, including the united states, do: spy on one another's networks.

neither adeyemo nor deese consulted with blackrock executives about the firm's engagement with the treasury department or regulators during their time with the company, said a person familiar with the matter.
things like the insurrection act and the general authorities of the president as commander in chief — there is room here for a president to abuse his responsibility in this area, panetta said. i think all of us can argue that the military has absolutely no role in determining elections, or for that matter in doing what law enforcement is responsible for doing in this country.
this is a guy who put together a $9 billion tax credit plan to try to lure amazon, but yet he wants to toss these jobs away? said allegheny county councilman sam demarco iii (r), referring to pittsburgh's unsuccessful effort to lure amazon's planned east coast headquarters. (amazon founder and ceo jeff bezos owns the washington post.)
there was also all the jazz surrounding the signing of the phase one trade deal with china, a 96-page agreement that commits china to buy $200 billion more in american products over the next two years. my post colleague david j. lynch notes, correctly, that trump's china bargain is the most concrete expression of his enthusiasm for 'managed trade,' which relies on government fiat to guarantee key results. his approach, also evident in deals with south korea, mexico and canada, is a striking departure from generations of u.s. trade gospel.
link copied link e.u. foreign ministers to hold emergency meeting friday to respond to iran crisis brussels — european union foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on friday in brussels to discuss how to respond to the escalating crisis with iran, diplomats said monday, including whether europe starts the process that could lead to the eventual reimposition of sanctions on iran. the unusual gathering will give europeans a chance to coordinate plans among all 28 member states. leaders have been reluctant to publicly condemn the united states for soleimani's killing, focusing most of their ire on iran, which they view as the core threat to their security interests. but they have invested more than a year of efforts to try to preserve the 2015 iran nuclear deal following trump's pullout. many european diplomats view soleimani's death as the final blow to hopes that the accord could hold together until the possible election in november of a u.s. president more supportive of the nuclear agreement than trump. iran on sunday announced that it would take major additional steps to depart from the terms of the nuclear accord, although it stopped short of saying it would significantly increase its uranium enrichment. europeans took that as a sign that tehran is still interested in extracting concessions in exchange for returning to at least partial adherence to the deal, rather than walking away from it altogether. triggering the process that could lead to the reimposition of sanctions would entail additional months of negotiations.
personal experiences can be powerful and life-altering. but the trouble with policies guided by the personal struggles of famous tv personalities is that they are not based on what average citizens need or what experts determine is optimal. they are based on the solipsism of influential people who are scandalized only by injustices that they experience personally.
but the often apocalyptic nature of the news about climate change is perhaps uniquely paralyzing. elizabeth haase, a psychiatrist in nevada, describes how some of her patients can be overwhelmed by the scale of the problem: i'm supposed to be emotionally hopeful in a hopeless situation, and i'm supposed to act powerful when the source of power is collective power and it's overwhelming, and i'm supposed to feel faith and do things to be sustainable when nature is declining around me. overcome by a sense of powerlessness, they simply feel stuck in a situation, with no way out.
our state is doing very little to slow transmission of the virus. we have a very lax policy environment. our businesses are open, said joe gerald, a university of arizona researcher who has been tracking the spread of the virus and was among those urging a shelter-in-place order. the virus is just basically transmitting almost uninhibited through our population.
trump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the united states. he did take a brief swipe at the opposing party, pointing out that some of the people in the room supported democrats over him in 2016. he also drew a smattering of boos when he attacked the news media as fake.

then trump intervened. for two months, he insisted that the presidential election in georgia — among other states — was rigged, stolen, subject to irregularities, fraudulent and on and on. exit polls tuesday showed that three-quarters of republican voters said the november election was not fair, while 9 in 10 democrats said it was fair.
he also became more adept at managing media campaigns. in a previously undisclosed email, leo boasted to a colleague in 2009 about his savvy at generating free publicity through the federalist society.

my initial gut says that the alleged disinformation campaign i've read about would not have been enough to affect this race. roy moore is so well known in alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted them as their senator before the race even started, said university of alabama political scientist joseph l. smith.
trump gives a speech at the mayflower hotel in washington promising warmer ties with russia. sessions, russian ambassador sergey kislyak and trump son-in-law jared kushner attend the event. sessions says in senate testimony that he does not recall meeting kislyak at that event.
she was also concerned that there was no assurance that government workers would receive back pay after their furloughs ended. there is no federal obligation to pay back wages, leaving the issue to be addressed in federal legislation when the government reopens. after each prior federal shutdown, legislation was passed to provide for back pay, but that might not happen in the current political environment. the economic hole created if furloughed government employees are not paid back wages could be significant. chapman pointed out that even if only 30 percent of furloughed civilian workers didn't receive back pay this would take $233 million out of our region's economy for each week of lost pay. this is money that will be lost forever – dragging down our economic growth and creating financial distress for many families.
if you can't sit on a sofa before you buy it, designer and artist kristin try of alexandria's gingham & grosgrain says you need to make sure the company you're buying from has great customer service. she chose the rose apartment sofa from interior define, a company she likes, for a client with a small space and traditional taste ( $1,200, interiordefine.com.) the english roll arm style makes it warmer than most of the urban-modern small-space sofas out there.

state department tells citizens 'do not travel' to china; world health organization declares coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency
governors, like the president, have the power to pardon and commute prison terms. presidential clemency has fallen on hard times as president trump wields it largely to benefit those with personal connections. he has proved even more miserly than his predecessors with clemency even though the coronavirus is ravaging federal prisons around the country. but the president is not the only one who appears to lack courage, compassion or interest. governors, with a total prison population of about 1.2 million, have together released only a few hundred men and women early. yet it is upon them to save people in their states' prisons from infection and death. as a side benefit, they may also save the pardon power.
a republican consultant with close ties to the white house said one reason trump has renominated even some of his more controversial picks is a sense of loyalty.
policy doesn't animate him. revenge animates him, said an adviser who had recently spoken with the president.
take, for example, the recent vandalism of bloomberg's campaign offices with epithets including racist, sexist, oligarch and corporate pig. yes, bloomberg is jewish, and yes, some of the insults were about his wealth, but none of the graffiti was anti-semitic. the hatred seemingly fueling the vandalism was based on class warfare, not race or religion; the vandals clearly didn't target bloomberg as a jew but as a billionaire, and well, they apparently believe it's time to eat the rich, as they spray-painted on the flint, mich., headquarters.
he was on a panel about freedom of association. most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the constitution. some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the constitution by activist judges. on the panel, barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. and so, barnett told me, i said at the end of my little talk, 'i know what you're thinking: what gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the constitution?'  he recalled that he paused dramatically. and then, as i had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the ninth amendment, which says the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. and when i said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.

up to the point where isis was territorially defeated last year, a current iraqi official said, iraq was on the radar screen because defeating the islamic state was an electoral priority of the president. once they were defeated, we were downgraded.
senior state department officials who briefed reporters late last week insisted that iraqis want us in the country — an argument esper echoed in comments at the pentagon on monday. but there are fears that events of the past few weeks have given pro-iranian forces an upper hand and distracted attention from anti-iranian uprisings that have swept iraq in recent months.
in washington, u.s. officials expressed high confidence that the boeing 737-800, bound for the ukrainian capital of kyiv, was targeted by air-defense systems as iranian forces were on high alert. president trump said the downing of the aircraft was probably a mistake.

king was not a communist; he criticized communism for denying god. but he was a political radical in his time, promoting peaceful lawbreaking to protest racial injustice — in god's name, no less. and he was unsparing in his criticism of godly men who failed to do the same. writing from a birmingham, ala., jail, in 1963, king expressed his disappointment in white ministers for failing to call out segregation as morally sinful. he also had choice words for white moderates, whom he described as a greater stumbling block to racial justice than even the ku klux klan. (suffice it to say, king never ran for statewide office in georgia.)
when jesus said we're all sinners, he really meant all of us, everybody. i don't think you can choose a president based on their personal behavior because even if you choose the one that you think is the most decent — let's say you decide mitt romney. nobody could be a more decent human being, better family man. but there might be things that he's done that we just don't know about. so you don't choose a president based on how good they are; you choose a president based on what their policies are. that's why i don't think it's hypocritical.

after bringing the islamic state to heel and claiming to be well on his way to stopping the endless wars in the middle east, president trump finds himself in the middle of an entirely new crisis on the same battlefield that bedeviled his two immediate predecessors.
in the middle east, as in europe, asia and north america, trump's approach has hewed closely to his lifelong belief that a person is judged by the deals he makes, by a reckoning of wins and losses. trump believes he wins because he can be purely transactional, free from the norms, ideologies and traditions that restrain his rivals.

trump boils complex issues down to things he can count, said g. richard shell, a professor of business ethics at the university of pennsylvania's wharton school. he asks, 'what's the asset here, and how can i get it?' he perceives unequal benefits being exchanged, and he immediately escalates to the highest level of conflict he can see. and then his people signal to him, 'no, no, no,' and he backs off. he backed off on separating families at the mexican border, and he'll back off on this crisis, shell said tuesday. on wednesday, trump did just that, delivering a measured address, noting that iran appears to be standing down and seeking to work together with tehran on shared priorities.

— from the new yorker's mick stevens, circa 1998:
part of the problem in the still-struggling united states is the tension between regulations intended to ensure a high-quality standard for tests and the need to roll out diagnostic capabilities very quickly. no test is perfect, and with high stakes for missing or misidentifying a case, public health officials want to make sure that tests are as accurate as possible and are validated by labs that run them. but the slowness may also reflect years of underinvestment in public health infrastructure — and a bias toward developing treatments that may seem more appealing to the public.

-- one facebook page tied to the disinformation campaign impersonated baptist prohibitionists who allegedly supported republican roy moore's candidacy. the new york times's scott shane and alan blinder report: the 'dry alabama' facebook page, illustrated with stark images of car wrecks and videos of families ruined by drink, had a blunt message: alcohol is the devil's work, and the state should ban it entirely. along with a companion twitter feed, the facebook page appeared to be the work of baptist teetotalers who supported [moore]. 'pray for roy moore,' one tweet exhorted. in fact, the dry alabama campaign, not previously reported, was the stealth creation of progressive democrats who were out to defeat mr. moore — the second such secret effort to be unmasked.
the statement, issued jointly by four agencies in a special task force, counters trump's baseless suggestion last month that the intrusions might have been the work of chinese hackers, ellen nakashima reports. secretary of state mike pompeo said previously that the breaches were 'clearly' russian in origin, and u.s. officials have for weeks said privately that moscow's foreign intelligence service carried them out. the breaches were so alarming that they had government and private-sector personnel working through the holidays to identify and mitigate them.

before obama won, though, he was the target of baseless allegations that he had not been born in the united states and, therefore, was ineligible to hold the office of president. this wasn't true, but it was politically potent. the assertion wasn't limited to conservative circles; during his hard-fought democratic primary victory over hillary clinton, even some democrats elevated the claims. but the claims were heavily centered on right-wing websites that were finding new audiences with the emergence of social media. rumors that spread over email spread more slowly than ones dropped into facebook and twitter (as the founder of snopes explained to the washington post in 2015). write up a blog post claiming evidence of obama's ineligibility and tweet it out and suddenly you can propel the misinformation everywhere — and make a decent bit of cash from new visitors to your website.

if time can be used to command our attention and impose order on our lives, then the ability to set it, and ultimately to decide how others use it, is a source of tremendous power. when clocks became fixtures in 19th-century british factories, workers complained that their bosses unfairly set the clocks ahead in the morning and back at night, to squeeze more labor out of the day. workmen, historian e.p. thompson noted, feared carrying their own watches, since it was no uncommon event for managers to fire any worker who presumed to know too much about the science of horology.

through a combination of nerve and hormonal signals, this system prompts your adrenal glands, located atop your kidneys, to release a surge of hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. adrenaline increases your heart rate, elevates your blood pressure and boosts energy supplies. cortisol, the primary stress hormone, increases sugars (glucose) in the bloodstream, enhances your brain's use of glucose and increases the availability of substances that repair tissues. cortisol also curbs functions that would be nonessential or detrimental in a fight-or-flight situation. it alters immune system responses and suppresses the digestive system, the reproductive system and growth processes. this complex natural alarm system also communicates with regions of your brain that control mood, motivation and fear.

in a long and violent day that the president urged his followers to remember forever, he was typical trump. he exhorted his followers, he spoke falsehoods, he took to twitter, he attacked the media, and he confronted the constitution of the united states. it was as if four years of the trump presidency were squeezed into one day. in the twilight of his presidency, trump was where he always yearns to be — in the middle of the vortex, at the center of attention in a broken nation.

the bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the affordable care act with a flat tax credit, based on age. currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. the size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. that helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.

with her divisive confirmation hearing and vice president pence's tie-breaking vote to secure her place in president trump's cabinet, education secretary betsy devos turned national headlines toward public education for the first time in years. her platform is singular: school choice. her education efforts in the past focused on expanding school choice for students in michigan, including charter schools run by for-profit companies, vouchers for independent and religious schools and more. while our organization strongly supports school choice, we know that without appropriate accountability mechanisms, school choice means a dangerous gamble for underserved students. when pushed by sen. tim kaine (d-va.), devos famously dodged his questions about equal accountability for all schools receiving federal funds.

at&t, for example, requires its unlimited data customers to subscribe to one of its television products, directv or u-verse. it doesn't matter if you already have at&t cellular service but not tv, or vice versa. you just need to end up with both phone and tv service at the end of the day to qualify for unlimited data. this might not make sense if you already get your tv service through a company such as comcast or verizon, but it could work for those households that don't already subscribe to tv. note that directv now, at&t's online streaming tv service, doesn't count toward this program. so if you have that and are simply hoping to tack on an unlimited wireless subscription, you're out of luck. (update: at&t has since revised its unlimited data plan, allowing you to purchase one without having to subscribe to one of at&t's tv services.)

tuesday, january 26, 1999; page e1 intel corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. the turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott intel products in protest of the chip's id component. this is a significant victory for privacy, said barry steinhardt, associate director for the american civil liberties union, who praised intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. they did it on internet time. in announcing the id feature of the new pentium iii microprocessor last week, intel officials described it as an important step for internet security. the id number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. while each chip still will have a unique number, intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the id function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. chuck mulloy, a spokesman for the santa clara, calif., company, acknowledged that intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. we're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, mulloy said.
the french, west german and other european intelligence services had either been told about the united states' arrangement with crypto or figured it out on their own. some were understandably jealous and probed for ways to secure a similar deal for themselves.
— the fbi is investigating fake text messages impersonating alyssa farah, vice president pence's press secretary, that were sent to several house republicans, the wall street journal's michael c. bender reported. at least one republican has been repeatedly engaging with the imposter, whose messages sought the whereabouts of certain lawmakers and their availability for meetings, according to the journal.

pullbacks of such magnitude are relatively common and usually occur over a two- to three-month period. but the jarring plunges over the past two weeks — on thursday the dow tumbled nearly 500 points in a mere 30 minutes before the closing bell — are beginning to reshape sentiment on wall street. some analysts are predicting darker, more volatile times ahead.

scholten, who ran 14 points ahead of hillary clinton in the district, had campaigned with a number of lesser-known democrats with presidential ambitions. warren, he said, had sent three fundraising letters on behalf of his campaign; when he was at the 2018 netroots nation conference in new orleans, warren made time for a meeting with him.
such a designation, a power granted by congress to a group of regulators called the financial stability oversight council, could have cut into blackrock's profits by requiring it to set aside more capital reserves or hire more compliance specialists, for instance, and it would have placed blackrock under the direct supervision of the fed. in late 2013, news leaked that the fsoc was reviewing blackrock and fidelity, another asset manager, as it studied the issue.
but that is not a significant change. the rules already enable a coalition of 218 legislators to pass a discharge petition that would compel a floor vote. the new rule would hardly make a dent on the leadership's power to set the agenda. the other promised changes have such large loopholes that pelosi still has full discretion over what will and will not receive a vote on the house floor.
critics argue that the approach could encourage young people to take more drugs and that it sends the wrong message. on-site tests have also been criticized as inaccurate, given the sometimes limited availability of equipment.
he twice put his money where his mouth was for jamaica when its foreign currency holdings were low and democratic socialism was on the rise: first in the 1970s and '80s when he realized the island had to build tourism hotels. then, in 1992, when the economy was threatened by currency speculators, he pumped $30 million of his own money into jamaican banks to keep them afloat.

jay bhattacharya, professor of medicine at stanford university:
trump has bludgeoned free-trade republicans into temporary submission, but it's far from clear that they've forgotten basic economics. they may have lost some enthusiasm for trade deals, but the gop wasn't the party of tariffs before trump, and it won't be after trump, when business interests can be expected to reassert their party influence.
most states have adopted centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and are prioritizing health-care workers and nursing home residents and staff, followed by front-line essential workers and individuals over the age of 75. but states can also set their own vaccine priorities and some are giving preference to vaccine trial volunteers who received the placebo or are focusing on vaccinating the elderly before first responders.
still, republicans ended their first day of divided government by promising to hold pro-pelosi democrats accountable. america rising blasted out a list of 21 democrats who went back on their word to back pelosi that included 11 from increasingly blue districts carried by clinton. the house gop's own rapid-response team called out 11 democrats, nine of whom won in safe blue seats.

ocasio-cortez, who defeated republican anthony pappas in november's general election, spoke about the minimum wage and assuring health care and the difficulties of working strange hours for service jobs — which all made sense to osorio. she sounded like she was from the real new york, not the one you see on tv where it's just white people, osorio said. she created a buzz around here, just because it felt like she knew our story.
the post-world war ii era was founded on u.s. economic dominance. that dominance is fading fast as globalization transfers resources, knowledge and power to countries outside the traditional u.s. alliance structure. america's economic and foreign policy elites remain in denial about this fundamental fact and persist in the belief that the united states can continue to exert global dominance without the economic or military dominance it has enjoyed for decades. without significant changes, such as dramatically increasing the size of the u.s. military and finding new allies to supplement or replace wavering old ones, the biden administration will more likely preside over america's decline than its resurgence.

now she gets involved in a legal dispute that requires the american legal system to decide whether wanda is indeed properly married to harry. maybe this is relevant to deciding whether wanda can refuse to testify against harry, or can file a joint tax return with harry, or inherits property when harry dies. to figure out whether the marriage is valid, montana courts would likely need to figure out if wanda's earlier elbonian divorce was valid (since, if it was invalid, wanda's marriage with harry is bigamous). and that can only be determined using elbonian law.

that approach, however, assumes that domestic decision-making is driven by foreign policy imperatives — an assumption that is rarely if ever true. my own approach to russian foreign policy begins from the argument that in russia, as in most other countries, domestic factors are in the driver's seat. when we see whelan's arrest from a russian vantage point — rather than from the banks of the potomac — three big questions emerge:
but romney's friends and leading anti-trump conservatives were glad to see him herald his arrival in washington by writing a cutting op-ed piece in the washington post that said the president has not risen to the mantle of the office. the move was taken as a gesture of solidarity at a time of mounting anxiety among establishment republicans.

the likely compromise involves a familiar emollient: spending. manchin isn't inclined, both ideologically and as a matter of political survival in his coal-fired state, to back legislation that directly attacks fossil fuels, such as rescinding tax breaks for the industry or, at a more extreme level, mandating curbs on fossil-fuel production or consumption. but backing more stimulus dollars for clean technology such as electric vehicles or renewable energy is a different prospect. while west virginians would bridle at a carbon tax, they aren't likely to be as exercised about vehicle chargers being built on their roads, especially if that brings jobs with it. and manchin's critical role means he should be able to secure more federal dollars for the sort of climate initiatives he has favored as ranking member on the energy committee, which potentially extend the lifespan of fossil-fuel consumption, such as carbon capture, use and sequestration.

it's an opaque process. vietnam has a collective four pillar leadership structure made up of general secretary, prime minister, president and chair of the national assembly, the nation's parliament. it governs in consultation with a 17- to 19-member politburo. nguyen phu trong, the current general secretary, also became president in 2018 following the death of president tran dai quang, meaning the top leadership was down to three. observers anticipate the government will revert to four pillars in 2021.

finally, the biden administration must take steps to address the deeper context from which such prejudiced policies arose in the first place. the bans are premised on the false and bigoted claim that african, muslim and other communities constitute an inherent threat to our country's national security. other policies pre-dating the bans have long been justified on the same premise. biden's administration should consult with these communities, their leaders, and grass-roots organizations serving them to ensure they are no longer treated as suspect. it must end discriminatory policing and surveillance programs, such as the department of homeland security's countering violent extremism and the targeting of black, arab, south asian, and other communities under policing partnerships such as the joint terrorism task force. these programs treat black and brown people as suspect and inherently violent, criminalizing our communities and eroding trust while failing to achieve their own stated goals. our communities deserve safety and dignity, not suspicion and bigotry.
theater blooms in the fertile ground of political turmoil. it's one of the form's most resilient characteristics. revolt sometimes springs directly from the stage; a dissident czech playwright, the late vaclav havel, after all, rose out of revolution to lead a country away from soviet domination.
a related concern is whether the program will be successful in actually reaching girls in rural communities. there's some evidence, however, that the community-based education strategy proposed by the deal has been effective in enabling girls to attend school in areas where they are unable to attend government schools because of insecurity, family resistance or community restrictions.
there are always some gray areas. that's why you have lawyers. so, for example, what is the definition of nonpublic information [that defines insider trading]? if price knows he is going to introduce a bill, but it's also general public knowledge he's going to introduce a bill, then he buys stock in a company affected by that bill, is that operating on nonpublic information? can he avoid the stock act by announcing the bill the day before and then introducing it and then buying the stock?

lindsey suggests a new political foundation based on devotion to democratic institutions, to the public interest, or the common weal — the values that we share across ethnic, regional, sectarian, and class lines and that require collective action for their advancement, to constructive governance (shrinking government just to make it smaller is not the goal, [but] hostility toward corruption and wastefulness does push toward making government simpler and more transparent) and to resisting concentrations of power and wealth (the basic intuition here is that freedom requires a level of personal independence among the citizenry, and that in turn requires a broad middle class and limited extremes of wealth and poverty. in the republican view, excessive imbalances of power and status undermine government in the public interest because both the rules themselves and their administration will end up slanted in favor of the powerful.).

howard thinks it's time for new record-keeping rules, including ones account for social media and disappearing posts. though much of the data created by congressional committees and administrative officers is considered official records and archived, individual members can decide what to do with papers and content created by their own offices. it's considered their personal property, and they can determine what they want to preserve. there's lots of reasons that politicians choose not to have things be archived, howard says.

for the most part, i ate what i wanted, just less of it. and i was spending a lot of time writing, which left me little time to cook. dinner was often a simple salad at the keyboard. if i couldn't be bothered to assemble vegetables, i had a bowl of cereal. i pretty much cut pasta and rice — the building blocks of my preferred diet — out of the picture. that hurt. i do love my carbohydrates.

bernhard's position is fairly common among voting security experts, although some allow wiggle room for paper trails provided those systems are paired with risk-limiting audits after the election. a risk-limiting audit is essentially a hand check of a representative sample of paper ballots or paper trails to make sure the machines that read votes are tallying them correctly.

opposition to domination leads simultaneously toward a deep appreciation of markets and the recognition of a vital supporting role for government. competitive markets are a bulwark of independence because they encourage a proliferation of options; they are an important check against arbitrary power because they subject market actors to accountability at the hands of their customers. but for market competition to operate as intended, government has a few big jobs to do. first, it must provide and enforce rules that structure and sustain competition; second, it must secure the broad enabling conditions that allow people to participate successfully in the market system and protect them from the hazards of life when their participation goes awry.

hospital officials in southern california said they were running low not just on icu beds but also on ventilators and morgue space. but perhaps the direst shortage is of oxygen. because covid-19 is a respiratory disease that attacks the lungs, most hospitalized patients require oxygen. the sheer number of patients has placed such a strain on oxygen systems that some hospitals are struggling to provide adequate air pressure and flow into patients' lungs. there are also shortages of portable oxygen tanks in ambulances as well as ones that are sent home with patients, making it difficult to discharge some patients even as hospitals run out of capacity.

at first, in public and in private, the obama administration leaned on karzai to fully investigate the kabul bank scandal — not only to recover the stolen money but also to demonstrate to the afghan people that no one was above the law. the episode was seen as a pivotal moment, not just in the anti-corruption campaign but in the war itself, according to the lessons learned interviews.

you look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system, she said. your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. but once you get to, like, the tippy tops — on your 10 millionth dollar — sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.

some qataris have provided support to al-qaeda and its spinoffs, but the country says it has stepped up efforts to clamp down on terrorism financing, particularly since 2017. the u.s. state department's 2018 report on terrorism said qatar has increased cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts and touted a new anti-money laundering law that was ultimately passed the following year. still, this cooperation followed years of criticism from the u.s. that the country served as a key fund-raising locale for groups like al-qaeda and the taliban, particularly through then poorly regulated charities. the u.s. says a longtime government minister provided support for khalid sheikh mohammed, mastermind of the september 11 attacks, who lived in qatar for several years during the 1990s. and in the disarray of the syrian revolution, some qatari support went to rebels who later went on to join islamic state. still, the u.s. has levied similar criticisms at other gulf states.

hopefully we're going to work together and get lots of things done, like infrastructure, he said. i think it will be a little bit different than people think.
i've had two elections. i won both of them. it's amazing. and i actually did much better on the second one.
now, the democrats of the bill want $12 billion additional for foreign aid. they want $12 billion more. it's $54.4 billion, which is by itself a lot, but in foreign aid they want 12 billion over the $54 billion. think of it. we give $54 billion, a lot of it because they want to give it. they don't even know who they're giving it to. in many cases, people don't ever — don't even know the name of the country. they know nothing about the country, and yet — so they're going to give 54.4 billion in foreign aid but they want 12 billion more than that in foreign aid but they won't approve $5.6 billion for a wall that's going to pay for itself almost on a monthly basis.
so a canadian tuning in to cbs to see the super bowl 50 last year didn't see the glitzy ads from u.s. advertisers, but rather more mundane fare from the likes of bank of montreal and the loblaws supermarket chain. that has angered canadians, who have been forced to go to youtube if they wanted to get a look at the most talked about super bowl ads.
the effects on women's representation are noticeable. of the 53 female legislators elected in 2013, 46 were alianza pais candidates, and only 7 came from other parties. in fact, as figure 1 shows, 46 percent of ap legislators were women, compared with just 19 percent of opposition legislators.

the georgia runoff campaigns were the most closely watched and consequential senate contests anyone could remember. the two races drew brigades of organizers, who flooded the state trying to turn out every possible voter. much credit goes to the multiple efforts to mobilize black voters, led by stacey abrams, latosha brown of black voters matter, and others.
maybe we were not agile or wise enough to reach out to the taliban early on, that we thought they were defeated and that they needed to be brought to justice, rather than that they should be accommodated or some reconciliation be done, zalmay khalilzad | lessons learned interview | 12/7/2016tap to view full document he said.

dunn, however, took issue with political commentary that she said overstates biden's prospects based on the georgia races. yesterday our agenda was dead, and today we can pass anything we want, she joked. that pendulum swings pretty wildly.
but there's probably a second reason for the taliban's deal with unicef. collaborating with organizations like unicef, political science analysis shows, can bolster the taliban's international legitimacy, carrying the symbolic significance of imitating a country's external relations. mullah akhtar mansour, a previous leader of the taliban, reportedly was aware that the taliban needed recognition from the international community to realize its political ambitions.
in new hampshire, the first primary state and where challengers to sitting presidents have historically gained traction, there is a fierce debate about whether the state party should endorse trump and curb the chances of a primary fight. gov. chris sununu (r), a trump ally, has said he sides with the republicans who want to protect the state's tradition of having the party stay away from endorsing.
gold and stocks don't usually rise at the same time. gold prices historically retreat when investors feast on stocks. and when stocks are wheezing, gold tends to surge.
for december 2017, we tallied 796 protests, demonstrations, strikes, marches, sit-ins and rallies in the united states, with at least one in every state and the district of columbia. our conservative guess is that between 58,986 and 81,091 people showed up at these political gatherings, although it is likely there were far more. because mainstream media often neglect to report nonviolent actions — especially small ones — it is probable that we did not record every event that took place. for 28 percent of the events we listed this month, we lacked an estimate of crowd size.

most immediately, biden has promised additional help to struggling families by providing $2,000 relief checks. senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.), who is poised to become majority leader, said tuesday that another round of stimulus checks is one of the first things we want to do should democrats prevail, noting that warnock and ossoff campaigned on them.

americans should not be forced to choose between their faith and their desire to help patients, tony perkins, president of the family research council, said in a statement. as president trump continues to follow through on his promises on these core issues, he will continue to have the support of social conservatives on his policy initiatives.

this is a defining moment in american politics. we can and should disagree about policies and about our country's direction. but refusing to recognize state-certified elections without evidence of fraud is an abdication of the higher responsibility to our constitution. elected officials who are engaging in this behavior must resist the urge of self-service, self-preservation and blind allegiance to a single person or party.
diplomats and military commanders acknowledged they struggled to answer simple questions: who is the enemy? whom can we count on as allies? how will we know when we have won?
so there's no evidence to back up trump's story. given his track record, we are pretty sure elements of it are false or exaggerated.
the piano company's showroom displays what purdon says are two of the finest pianos in the world — the italian fazioli, which he compared to a ferrari, and the japanese shigeru kawai, the top of the line for the kawai brand. what sets them apart are craftsmanship and attention to detail, he said.
in an increasingly black-and-white world where liberal democracies face an existential challenge from authoritarians and populists, merkel still sees gray — and not only with china, barkin wrote in foreign policy. the bargain she brokered recently with democratic backsliders hungary and poland to avert a clash over the eu budget is another example. george soros accused her of surrendering to extortion.
as he watched television, trump spent much of the afternoon fuming about vice president pence instead of worrying about the violence in the capitol, even lambasting pence while he was in a secure location, trying to remain safe from the mob. pence said earlier in the day that he would not intervene to change the outcome of the election.
south korean authorities pledged to test more than 200,000 members of the shincheonji church of jesus, whose followers made up a major cluster of early cases. coronavirus tests also will be offered to everyone in daegu who has cold-like symptoms, an estimated 28,000 people.
american partisans have developed a worrisome enthusiasm for accusing their political rivals of criminal behavior.
here is a look at the events in the administration as the white house proposed various ways to punish russia during the final months of the presidential campaign:
the chain of events that trump describes — and calls catch and release — applies when someone first appeals for asylum. the united states follows the universal declaration of human rights and the united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees, which says that a refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts.
he also repeated his dubious claim that savings from a new trade deal with mexico and canada would make good on his pledge that mexico would pay for the border wall. the trade deal has yet to be ratified by congress and includes no direct mechanism to fund the wall. trump's argument has been widely debunked by factcheckers.
the incoming biden team is quietly contacting business leaders and their washington lobbyists, soliciting their input as they fill out personnel and policy plans and signaling they intend to keep open lines of communication once they take power.
likewise, s4ca's efforts to get national school board groups to lobby on climate change have come up short. chris ungar has been a school board member for 20 years in california's san luis coastal unified school district. last spring, he proposed language to the national school boards association recognizing climate change as a threat and asking congress for funding to help schools affected by natural disasters. it easily passed a policy committee, but before the full association the resolution was, in ungar's words, gutted — the climate change language stripped because delegates from some states worried that it could obscure the natural-disaster funding request.

white house aides tried to get trump to call in to fox news channel, but he refused. he at first did not want to say anything, but was persuaded to send some tweets. then they scripted a video message for him to record, which he agreed to distribute on twitter. but the president ad-libbed by including references to false voter fraud claims that they had asked him not to include, the administration official said. twitter later locked his account, enraging the president.

that movement was born during the local backlash against new immigrants in the county that helped launch stewart's political career.
jones's narrow, upset victory over republican roy moore in all likelihood resulted from other factors, political analysts say. moore spent much of the special-election campaign battling reports in the post that he had decades earlier made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls.
later in her career, dr. sandler explored the chilly environment on campus that greeted minorities much as it greeted women. interviewed in 1994 by the publication hispanic outlook in higher education, she reflected on the rejection that sent her on a path of advocacy.
but it does suggest that news reports describing high staff turnover, impulsive decision-making, an increasingly isolated chief executive and a chaotic atmosphere are valid. far from being made up out of whole cloth, they are quite an accurate representation of an unsettling reality — despite what trump would have us believe.

eight months after they started, the anti-government protests have largely been extinguished. but it is unclear whether the government's increasingly repressive measures will keep ortega in power until the next election, in 2021.
with that being said, we're pulling out of syria but we're doing it, and we won't be finally pulled out until isis is gone, trump said.
but maybe trump did not know that and nazarbayev just restated the existing agreement? trump has previously claimed he got china's president to reopen its market to american beef even though the deal had already been reached during the obama administration.
if you don't care about how good your video looks or how nice your streaming audio sounds, you might consider saving some money and opting for t-mobile or sprint. both carriers tend to downgrade content quality to reduce the load on their networks; sprint is particularly aggressive about it, limiting audio streams to a bitrate of 500 kbps, online games to 2 mbps and video to 480p resolution. this means audio may sound less clear, video games may not perform as smoothly and video may not appear as sharp. there doesn't appear to be a way around sprint's policy, but it also offers the cheapest unlimited plan of the bunch.
lee may get new support from liberal antiwar democrats who took their seats on thursday, including rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york. during her campaign, ocasio-cortez said she probably would not have voted in favor of any of the troop commitments approved since the start of the afghan war, although she voiced some support for obama's rationale that his troop increase was an attempt to deal with this mess of going into afghanistan in the first place.

a national review editor criticized the new congresswoman's response:
purchasing social-media followers is sad, but i don't think it's a clear ethical violation, said andrew seaman, chairman of the ethics committee for the society of professional journalists. general dishonesty and misrepresentation is a cause for concern, however. i think anything like this is justification for a news organization to ask: what else is this person misrepresenting?
the swiss government announced on tuesday that it was launching an investigation of crypto ag's ties to the cia and bnd. earlier this month, swiss officials revoked crypto international's export license.
in an interview on fox news, romney suggests that trump is trying to hide something by not releasing his taxes.
this strikes me as a typical trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of afghanistan, says former ambassador to turkey, eric s. edelman. the soviet union went into afghanistan to prop up one faction of the people's democratic party of afghanistan (pdpa) against another. their invasion catalyzed the existing islamist opposition to the pdpa but i digress. (in other words, trump's claim russia went into afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.) edelman adds, simply put he has no idea what he is talking about.

but trump's standing on the issue aside, this is the day bloomberg's campaign had to know was coming, and the questions about it are thoroughly valid. bloomberg finally disowned the stop-and-frisk policy when he began running for president, but he had previously defended it to the hilt. it's not unreasonable to consider this his biggest obstacle to the democratic nomination, especially given the important role minority voters will play after tuesday's primary in new hampshire.
dawn laguens, executive vice president for the planned parenthood action fund, said the reversal is meant to encourage states to block access to care at planned parenthood and control where women can go for health care.
and the other is that some of valentine's most popular images were depictions of black people that seem openly exploitative. a young boy who unloaded coal for valentine's studio was immortalized as the nation's ward, a bust with exaggerated features that martin said fit into the demeaning tradition of pickaninny caricatures. another subject was henry page, who had been enslaved by the valentine family and was depicted as the kindly, smiling uncle henry — akin to an uncle tom figure.
india, russia, you look at some of the satellite countries that are extremely wealthy with oil surrounding. i spoke to some of this. i said to them a certain country, very rich country, what would you do if the united states pulled out? 'oh, we'd be taken over by the taliban and terrorists.' i said then why are you charging us when we have to use your country to send product through? why are you charging us when we send airplanes over your country? we are doing the job for you. why are you charging us? he said to me, very great gentleman, smart, he said to me: 'well, nobody ever asked me not to.' i said, 'i'm asking you not to.' he said we will not charge you, and i am talking about millions and millions of dollars. flights over his country. but i say to him what would happen if we weren't here and he looks at me and he goes, 'we would be overrun, we could not defend ourselves,' and yet he charges us, but he doesn't charge us anymore.

sure, if a terrorist is someone who is trying to overthrow a political regime. i guess it depends on what your definition of terrorism is. anybody who kills anybody else or commits violence against anybody else because of their race is horrible. it's just as bad as the 9/11 attack.
a few lucky people have happened onto a shot this way, like law student david macmillan, who recorded his experience in a tiktok video that went viral. mcmillan and a friend were shopping at a giant grocery store in northeast washington when a pharmacist offered to vaccinate them because she had an open vial of the vaccine that would otherwise be discarded and the store was closing soon.
the bill applies to spaces rented for high-security government use. it was introduced in response to a 2017 government accountability office report that raised concerns that privately leased spaces could make government agencies susceptible to espionage.
some states have enacted laws intended to protect the driver and some motivated by trying to protect the animal. at least one state, hawaii, has a standalone traffic law that prohibits driving with a pet on one's lap; new jersey has a law that allows officers with the new jersey society for the prevention of cruelty to animal to fine drivers traveling with an improperly restrained animal.
let us try to break the vicious circle of recrimination, undercutting and discrediting, by avoiding gossip and slander in the pursuit of a path of prayerful and contrite acceptance of our limitations and sins, francis wrote.
among them was mohammed qasim fahim khan, a tajik militia commander. as leader of the northern alliance, fahim khan played a critical role in helping the united states topple the taliban in 2001. he served as afghanistan's defense minister from 2001 to 2004 and later as the country's first vice president — despite a reputation for brutality and graft.

normally, lawmakers must offset any increase in government spending with cuts or tax increases, under the pay-as-you-go rule. this requirement can make it incredibly difficult to achieve consensus on any legislation demanding significant cash.

female professors, she found, were more likely than male professors to be challenged on their credentials. those with phds were not consistently addressed as dr., and students expected greater leniency from women when they failed to complete their assignments.
trump reportedly reacted to a discussion of that last component of the deal by saying: why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here? before suggesting the united states should instead allow in more people from countries like norway. trump now claims he only used tough language about this deal, but his reported comments illuminate his actual policy stance: trump is, in fact, rejecting the deal because it lets in too many people from what he thinks are shithole countries, or lets too many of them remain.
another possibility: senate republicans actually endorse one of the clean funding bills the house has already passed. it's unlikely that one of these could get the 60 votes needed to move forward with a final vote, but even if it did, trump has said he would veto it. but congress could override that if the bills pass both chambers with two-thirds support. it would be a stretch in the senate, where 19 republicans would have to vote with the entire democratic caucus. mcconnell is unlikely to bring up a bill that doesn't have majority gop backing. but enough republicans are up for reelection in 2020 in swing-ish states that it could be done, especially because the senate unanimously passed a clean funding bill before the shutdown.

there are an increasing number of protections in place for consumers — things like the ability to opt in and opt out, or needing consent to use their data, she said. employees, however, have less control over how their employers use their data. yet plenty of data is at risk. beyond social security numbers and bank account information from direct deposits, data like what movies you watched in a hotel room on a business trip (charged to a corporate credit card) or what vacation days you took could reveal other personal tastes or even religious information to outside parties.

but teachers and others who expressed concern that she was rushing to implement untested reforms were (at best) ignored. they were called defenders of the status quo, with the status quo being a bad thing. education secretary betsy devos, who has made clear her disdain for the traditional public education system, uses that term now to describe her critics, along with sycophants of the system.
republicans argue trump's nominees have faced unwarranted resistance from senate democrats, whom they accuse of trying to run out the clock on many of the president's picks, and say most remain worthy of consideration. trump himself has repeatedly complained about senate democrats, calling them good at obstruction.

unlike romney, the departing senators have not ruled out challenging trump. flake has repeatedly said he is considering a 2020 run. corker said last month, i haven't ruled it out, and suggested that trump might not run for reelection. a 2016 trump foe, outgoing ohio gov. john kasich, already has traveled to early voting states and publicly left his options open.
both developments had exhaustive community input, public hearings, multiple votes at the d.c. zoning commission and significant compromises with neighbors, plus, for mcmillan, a lengthy historic-preservation process and multiple votes at the d.c. council. now the court decisions have delayed them by years at best, indefinitely at worst.

the absence of the late senator john mccain (r-ariz.), coupled with the retirements of gop senators bob corker (tenn.) and jeff flake (ariz.), has only intensified the angst among republicans who see trump as unbound by criticism from within the party.
it's the fear that you are not dealing with someone who recognizes any responsibility to the constitution. his only responsibility, from this president's point of view, is to himself, former defense secretary leon panetta said in an interview, when asked about the rationale for the letter. when you operate on that basis, there's no holds barred as to what a president may do. it is that scenario that scares the hell out of people in terms of the future of our democracy.

meet in the middle? given the stakes, horizon investment's greg valliere predicts progress. both sides have compelling reasons to act – china quite clearly is suffering from an economic slowdown, and donald trump obviously fears that a nervous stock market could imperil his re-election, he writes in his morning note. thus we believe there will be a constructive statement tomorrow, with hints that high-level officials will meet later this month to hammer out an agreement in principle.
unless there is a feedback mechanism inducing local officials to care about attracting migrants, we argue that interjurisdictional migration will be nothing more than a trip from the frying pan to fire. foot-voters would either over-crowd the good jurisdictions or not bother moving at all, because they would have no guarantee that well-governed destinations would stay well-governed. this does not mean that foot-voting is pointless: it just means that migration should be regarded as a complement to ballot-voting, not a substitute. ilya's argument for foot-voting, in other words, becomes much more powerful if one recognizes that foot-voting actually improves local ballot-voters' incentives to cast an intelligent vote. one such incentive is the prospect of foot-voters' buying their houses. our criticism is offered, therefore, more as a friendly amendment than a refutation to ilya's outstanding book.

we want to spend a lot of money, put a lot of cops in the street, put those cops where the crime is, which is in the minority neighborhoods. so this is — one of the unintended consequences is, people say, oh my god, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities. yes, that's true. why? because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. yes, that's true. why do we do it? because that's where all the crime is. and the first thing you can do for people is to stop them getting killed. now we did a calculation of how many people who would have been dead if we hadn't brought down the murder rate and gotten guns off the streets. and the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw 'em against the wall and frisk 'em. and then they start — they say, i don't want to get caught, so they don't bring the gun. they still have a gun, but they leave it at home.

i think i know the answer: a certain percentage of conservatives think trump saved the country simply by deregulating industry and keeping his promise to appoint conservatives to the supreme court. full stop. he was their bulwark against decline and fall. they believe in his unsubstantiated claims that the election was rigged for the same reasons. it is all in the service of a higher calling: free markets, freedom of conscience, and a pro-life position that can't be compromised as a matter of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

communities in afghanistan appear to be leveraging the taliban's need for support and finding new ways to push back on the armed group's rules. some experts attribute the shift in the taliban's narrative on girls' schooling to pressure from communities that want their daughters to have access to education. these demands might have persuaded the taliban to take a more flexible approach. in some cases, village elders made subtle threats that they would turn against the group and provide information to the taliban's foes if the taliban did not respect the community's wishes. however, pressure from civilians has its limits, and has in some cases been met with violence on the part of the taliban.

with the exception of the smallpox vaccine, which can cause a rare but serious infection of the fetus, vaccines have been safe and enormously beneficial for pregnant women and their babies. experts say the safety of the new mrna vaccines, which do not contain live virus, would probably be similar in pregnant and nonpregnant people. what's more, pregnant women face the potential of severe illness from covid-19, which may also increase the risk of preterm birth and other serious outcomes for both mother and infant. experts also warn against lumping the two distinct biological phases of pregnancy and lactation together.

in 1880, britain adopted greenwich mean time as legal standard time. four years later, an international conference named gmt as the global prime meridian, against which all other times would be set.the royal observatory in greenwich became a key tool of imperial administration: the time of day in any given place would now be dictated by technocrats in london, rather than by the position of the sun overhead, as it had been for thousands of years. in this way, postal routes, train travel, workdays, markets and meetings could be coordinated. but many found the idea alienating. in 1894, martial bourdin, a 26-year-old french anarchist, died in london after a homemade bomb he was carrying exploded in his hands. police speculated that his target was the greenwich observatory. it would have been, in the language of modern counterterrorism, a highly symbolic soft target for an anarchist.

the washington post's jeff stein crunched the numbers with tax experts and found a new bracket for those earning more than $10 million a year would hit 16,000 households. roughly doubling the rate they pay on income over that threshold, as a 70 percent rate would, could generate $720 billion over a decade. that could pay for a number of liberal dream programs. from jeff: it could come close to funding the entirety of sanders's free college tuition plan ($800 billion), fund president barack obama's plan to get close to universal prekindergarten ($75 billion over a decade), forgive more than half the student debt in america ($1.4 trillion), cover democratic leaders' plan for boosting teacher pay and school funding ($100 billion), or come close to funding a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.

as the 2020 election approached, this alliance held. trump's repeated attacks on the mail-in voting process and his refusals to say he would concede peacefully should he lose were met with shrugs. the 2018 elections were largely a rout for the democrats thanks to trump's unpopularity and, clearly, because many 2016 trump voters stayed home with him not on the ballot. but being close to trump wasn't itself necessarily disqualifying in that environment: trump allies such as ron desantis in florida and brian kemp in georgia won close gubernatorial races. so even as it seemed clear trump would lose his reelection bid, most republicans stuck with him.

after the year ends, medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. if the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, joseph and christopher write. if the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to medicare....a detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the journal shows that 69% of part d members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.
it's possible that he can win over voters in the middle who are tired of trump and that biden offers the reassurance of an old white guy who talks a lot about how we can all get along if we just wind the clock back four years and pretend trump never happened. but it's also possible, if not likely, that biden will prove to be an uninspiring candidate of the kind democrats have ridden to defeat so many times before, one who will lose more votes through the deadening of turnout than he'll win by converting republicans.

in reality, that's not necessarily a problem. the first public meeting explicitly called in the name of women's rights — the seneca falls convention of 1848 — is considered the start of the suffrage movement. true, it included the right to vote on its — very long — official list of policy grievances, the declaration of sentiments. but suffrage was the item attendees objected to most, for fear the demand was so radical it would divide a movement.
surfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, teles explains. there's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. the judges need scholarship and arguments extending federalist principles into new areas. where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. they require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.

since ww2, u.s. foreign policy has been completely dominated by national security policy. in fact, it's hard to imagine a u.s. policy that doesn't view the world through a militaristic, cold war lens. this means that all other aspects of foreign policy are conducted in support of (slaved to) national security policy. in particular, u.s. trade policy is configured to promote the economic growth of allied nations (originally to fight the cold war) even if these trade relationships damage u.s. economic performance.

but a fighting force — even one as formidable as the united states military — isn't truly ready unless its members have confidence that their needs are being addressed on the home front. for service members, a major component of readiness is knowing that as they move from base to base with family in tow, the quality of their children's education doesn't suffer. currently, though, readiness is being negatively impacted because many military families are making decisions about whether to leave the armed forces or to accept a move to a particular duty station based in part on the quality of the surrounding schools. these choices can create a brain drain that ultimately undermines the nation's fighting force.

the vandalism is just the most extreme example of something true across the board when it comes to bloomberg: most of the criticism he faces, aside from censure over the racist stop-and-frisk policy he instituted as mayor, focuses on his staggering wealth and how he's used it to buy power and influence. that is a familiar jewish stereotype, yet it's not anti-semitic in this case because bloomberg's jewishness is completely irrelevant; he's accused of these things not because he's jewish but because he's bloomberg. anti-semitic canards are based on generalizations and myths. this critique is specific.

trump seeks a dramatic change in u.s. grand strategy, but sustaining policies that are unpopular will likely prove difficult over the long haul. our experiment suggests that trump will have difficulty persuading the american public to support many of his desired changes. nuclear proliferation and the first use of nuclear weapons are not popular with americans, and trump's rhetoric appears — at least thus far — not to change anyone's minds.

house democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. the new democrat-controlled house will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, karoun writes. the measure may even pull along some republican support. … but it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the senate, which remains under republican control. the closest that the senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the sandy hook elementary school shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.

we looked at what would happen if every borrower who would benefit from an income-driven repayment plan were put into one — specifically, a plan that required a 10 percent payment for all income above 150 percent of the poverty line, and forgave loans after 20 years (the terms of the more generous current plans). in that case, people in the bottom decile of earners would get four times the amount of debt forgiveness as those in the top decile. the bottom half of earners would get more than half the gains.

none of this is to compare ocasio-cortez's falsehoods to trump's; she's right that there is no comparison. trump's are both exponentially more numerous and more impactful, coming from the president of the united states. but just because something is worse doesn't mean something else can't be bad. people need to recognize that morally right is a subjective definition, and there need be no choice between making your case and using actual facts. using exaggerated or made-up facts actually suggests your cause is weak — and that you haven't done your homework. if politicians misunderstand these very basic and crucial distinctions, how can we trust them to know what's best about the underlying policies? how much have you really studied this thing?
while the 9th circuit did not address this at great length, focusing instead on due-process arguments, it did accept the basic validity of the form of the states' argument. the states' claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions, wrote the court.

hawks in the washington establishment have cheered trump's apparent about-face. i think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out, said sen. lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.), telling cbs's face the nation that the bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that isis doesn't come back. and i applaud the president for reevaluating what he's doing. ... he has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. i share that goal. let's just do it smartly.
the pandemic has driven drops in attendance, college applications and academic performance among the nation's most vulnerable students: children who are low-income, black or hispanic, as well as those with learning disabilities and those whose first language is not english. all too often, homeless children — of whom there are 2.5 million every year in america — combine these factors, hannah natanson reports. trying to learn inside shelters for the past nine months, students have faced spotty wifi, crowded rooms, high noise levels and harassment from some peers who deduce, over zoom, that they lack a home. … school officials in northern virginia, and nationwide, have gone to great lengths to reach vulnerable, struggling and low-income children. they have expanded internet into school parking lots, provided families with wifi hotspots and hand-delivered needed devices to households, including chromebooks and ipads. … but homeless children pose a unique challenge. their parents are sometimes unwilling or unable to communicate their circumstances. some shelters, for example those catering to victims of abuse, take pains to hide their location. so, if a homeless child drops off the screen, it can prove impossible to track them.

baltimore's plans also used the results of residential segregation, including the racialized geography of proximity to family, churches, jobs and the familiar, as reasons to justify continuing such segregation. despite hud's attempted intervention, these new plans did as little to encourage integration as freedom of choice plans had done before. throughout the 1970s and 1980s, white public housing applicants could ensure placement in a white housing project by designating preference in the eastern group, where two projects had majority-white occupancy. if an applicant's employment necessitated living in the southern portion of the city, they could likewise specify a preference for proximity to the familiar to stay at the top of the wait list until an opening occurred in that area's majority-white project.

to be sure, after four years of bureaucratic mayhem and mismanagement under president trump, there is comfort knowing that national security will be run by people who are competent and experienced. yet, even though competence is a prerequisite to good policymaking, it's not enough by itself. the concern around washington is that the same people who crafted and defended president barack obama's foreign policy won't be willing or able to recognize, much less rectify, its shortcomings.

on friday, trump will address the march from the white house rose garden via satellite, according to organizers. but as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. at minimum, they agree, trump welcomed their movement back into the white house and treats them with respect.
too much of the debate over student-loan forgiveness has focused on reducing the nominal balances without considering whether they are on track to be repaid. our analysis suggests some policy alternatives: nudging more people into income-driven repayment plans would achieve more forgiveness for low-income borrowers, for instance. so would making those plans more generous.

biden, meanwhile, took a different course as he approached the georgia races. in his final appearance on monday, he focused on the differences that democratic control of the senate would make for the voters — beginning with $2,000 covid relief payments, which were blocked in the republican-controlled senate. he never mentioned trump's phone call to raffensperger.

significant academic damage to children has already been recorded, particularly in math, as students have struggled to connect and teachers have struggled to teach remotely. students of color and those in low-income families are seeing the steepest losses — exacerbating existing inequities. in a december report, the consulting firm mckinsey & co. predicted that white students could lose the equivalent of eight months of math if schools stayed closed through june, while students of color could lose as much as 12 months. mckinsey estimates that high-intensity tutoring to cover half of u.s. students would cost $66 billion (at $2,500 per student), and advocates hope the federal government and private foundations will pay the bill.

another possible candidate with experience as governor of an economically prosperous state is former virginia governor terry mcauliffe. his post op-ed stresses his practicality. democrats must maintain our credibility with a pledge of results that are honest and achievable, he writes. we can expand the affordable care act and take on pharmaceutical companies' cartel pricing, pass comprehensive climate change legislation and substantially raise incomes through minimum-wage increases and tax fairness. and he deliberately contrasts his own results with a more strident progressive vision that includes guaranteed jobs and free college tuition. when the stakes are another four years of trump degrading our country, do we really want to use the 2020 campaign as a first-time experiment on idealistic but unrealistic policies?
i'm not sure it ever will. we will not go back to a pre-covid-19 normal. we will instead exist in world with a new normal. and even that will in part be determined by the availability of adequate vaccine supply to cover everyone in high, middle and low income countries. i look forward to the day when my office hours are as they were pre-covid-19.

this is unacceptable. it's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. first, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. we want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. the model here is the bermuda principles for the human genome project, where results were posted nightly.

what might be most problematic about ocasio-cortez's defense, though, is the idea that people should care less about specific facts and more about being morally right — as if this is a zero-sum game in which the two can be weighed against one another. she's practically saying, well, maybe i was wrong, but at least my cause is just.

the battle over the $2,000 checks shows how not to manage this tension. orthodox conservatives oppose the checks because they would lead to more debt. they hew to the old preferences for limited government activity and prioritization of debt control regardless of the circumstances facing the country. so-called populists such as sen. josh hawley (r-mo.), however, favor sending the checks on the theory that government must act indiscriminately in time of need. both impulses fail to understand the working-class mind-set and weaken the conservative and working-class coalition both sides want to create.
the new government announced it wants to stop the private housing of asylum seekers, providing instead only centralized accommodation facilities. in addition, it wants to take their cash to help pay for basic provisions. the coalition also says it will substantially reduce minimum social welfare support for recognized asylum seekers and those granted subsidiary protection. further, the government wants to adapt naturalization rules, which probably means making it harder for many (but not for all) to become an austrian citizen.

the program had limits. america's main adversaries, including the soviet union and china, were never crypto customers. their well-founded suspicions of the company's ties to the west shielded them from exposure, although the cia history suggests that u.s. spies learned a great deal by monitoring other countries' interactions with moscow and beijing.
today, about 13,000 u.s. troops are still in afghanistan. the u.s. military acknowledges the taliban is stronger now than at any point since 2001. yet there has been no comprehensive public reckoning for the strategic failures behind the longest war in american history.

turning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. the affordable care act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. the broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.

for instance, the cfpb director would become an at-will political appointee. this means that — unlike the officials who run the fed, federal trade commission or securities and exchange commission — the cfpb director could be fired without cause. the bureau would cease to be an independent agency and could be pressured at any time to drop investigations of, say, friends of the president.

crypto itself hobbled along. it had survived the transitions from metal boxes to electronic circuits, going from teletype machines to enciphered voice systems. but it struggled to maintain its footing as the encryption market moved from hardware to software. u.s. intelligence agencies appear to have been content to let the crypto operation play out, even as the nsa's attention shifted to finding ways to exploit the global reach of google, microsoft, verizon and other u.s. tech powers.

the biden's administration will likely try to push back against this, and e.u. governments will accommodate u.s. requests to some degree. e.u. countries still feel threatened by russia, and they remain dependent on the u.s. military to deter russian aggression. but make no mistake: e.u. leaders have been saying for years that they want to be neutral in the u.s.-china conflict. unless the german or french governments decide to change those aspirations, europe will try to chart a course between the two global superpowers, tacking to and fro to keep on both nations' good side. this will give the united states some instances where it can claim to have blunted china's rise, but the underlying economic fact of growing interdependence will ultimately prove more important.

the last time schumer and pelosi met trump at the white house, on dec. 11, it turned into a bizarre televised squabble during which trump claimed he would be proud to shut down the government over the wall and insisted he would take ownership of any shutdown. the agencies that are unfunded and in shutdown mode include homeland security, which pays for the wall; as well as the departments of agriculture, justice, interior, transportation, state, and housing and urban development. nasa is also partially shut down, along with the national park service and an array of smaller agencies.

though women resisted, persisted and continued to make progress in politics, policy and the workforce all four years that a misogynist was in office, it was the coronavirus (and trump's handling of it) that has profoundly worsened the lives of women everywhere. every day brings new examples of the ways in which women are being left behind by the world's response to the pandemic, philanthropist melinda gates wrote in foreign affairs.

more broadly, constitutional structure supports examining only executive statements to interpret executive action. when trump made his most controversial statements, he was private citizen. he had not sworn to uphold the constitution, or to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. he was, in this sense, a legally differently obligated person. his policies and their relation to the constitution would presumably be affected by his oath — that is why the constitution requires it.

let's start with biden. his victory in south carolina does not change the fundamental fact that he is simply terrible at running for president — even worse than in his disastrous runs in 1988 and 2008. those who are on the campaign trail will tell you that he is showing his age — he starts sentences then can't find his way out of them, he's surly when challenged, and he says cringeworthy things on a daily basis. his debate performances have ranged from barely acceptable to abysmal.
republican leaders tried to appease the tea partyers to leverage the energy. a number of policy concessions emerged. the party shifted to the right. but the enthusiasm for the tea party movement was driven heavily by opposition to obama and a changing america, and the elevation of various policy issues as central concerns was often secondary. put another way, there was no appeasing those for whom the fight itself was often the desired goal.

whether speedy, free shipping will prove enticing enough to woo new shoppers remains to be seen. amazon's prime program has grown into something much more expansive than just a shipping deal. membership also includes services like tv streaming, digital photo storage and a program for borrowing e-books. and so begins an important experiment: can walmart now compete better for shoppers who haven't already been lured into the amazon ecosystem? and can it pick off some of the ones who have stuck with amazon purely for its shopping experience, not for its service offerings?
depending on what happens with the coronavirus, to many voters the status quo, particularly the economic status quo, may seem pretty good, and even if they don't like trump, they'll take him over a future that they've come to find unsettling. you can see that in the many stories emerging about disgruntled republicans and independents saying they'll vote for a democrat — unless it's sanders. right now those are just anecdotes, but they could begin to pile up into something more threatening to his prospects.

the nexus between climate change and the mental health of children is rarely at the forefront of the discussion around environmental politics, but it's very real: in a washington post-kaiser family foundation poll of american teenagers released in september, 57 percent said that climate change made them feel scared and 52 percent said it made them feel angry, both higher rates than among adults. just 29 percent of teens said they were optimistic. reports like the u.s. government's national climate assessment have cited mental health concerns as a side effect of climate change. the american academy of pediatrics issued a policy statement in 2015 warning that climate change poses threats to children's mental and physical health, and that failure to take prompt, substantive action would be an act of injustice to all children.
many of these measures will severely constrain often-vulnerable immigrants. however, they do not break radically from past policies. for instance, in regional government coalitions with the övp, even the greens agreed to reduce minimum social welfare benefits for all recipients, often recognized asylum seekers. and denmark and switzerland, for example, already take cash from asylum seekers.

working toward a solution, in fact, is the consensus approach to calming young people's fears about the future. the key to addressing eco-anxiety at any age, says psychiatrist haase, is getting unstuck, losing that feeling of paralysis in the face of the problem's magnitude. haase is a founding member of the climate psychiatry alliance, an ad hoc group that has sprung up to offer patients and doctors advice on discussing climate anxiety. it's one of a number of such groups that are tackling the growing rate of patients panicked about the state of the world: the good grief network was launched in 2016 to offer group counseling sessions to the climate-anxious.

but former officials said much of their frustration with blackrock stemmed not from any specific policy position but rather what they saw as the firm's aggressiveness and its willingness to exaggerate regulators' actions to members of congress. they viewed its bare-knuckles approach in washington as contrary to its public stance of praising regulators for their actions after the 2008 crisis.

charles santiago, a member of the malaysian parliament who chairs the association of southeast asian nations' parliamentarians for human rights group, said trump was joining in infamy the likes of hun sen and rodrigo duterte, in trying to destroy democratic institutions and undermine the will of the people here in this region. hun sen has held power in cambodia since 1985, while duterte's administration in the philippines has locked up many of its critics.

pence's event was interrupted by someone who shouted a demand that pence overturn the presidential election results, cleve wootson, michael scherer, david weigel and reis thebault report. biden turned trump's efforts to overturn the november election results into a rallying cry to drive democrats to the polls on tuesday … at the final public rallies for loeffler, her loudest applause came not when discussing her background in business, or the 'radical liberal' agendas of the democrats, but when discussing republican challenges to the nov. 3 vote. … the democratic candidates spent the closing days of the race trying to refocus the campaign on more local concerns such as health care and jobs, even as they brought in star power to help seal the deal and continued to jab at trump. a closing ad for [jon] ossoff featured narration by former president barack obama and a musical appearance by john legend. … democrats, who have long considered themselves underdogs in the runoff contests, have been cheered by early vote numbers and clear signs in the state that many core democratic constituencies, including suburban and urban voters, remained engaged.
fears about gay americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the cold war. previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. in 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, roscoe hillenkoetter, the first director of the central intelligence agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. nonetheless, hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.

after absorbing a mixed december jobs report, the 10-year treasury yield fell eight basis points, sean becketti, freddie mac's chief economist, said in a statement. the 30-year mortgage rate moved in tandem with treasury yields falling eight basis points to 4.12 percent, the second decline since the presidential election. the december jobs report showed 156,000 jobs added, barely meeting many experts' expectations, while wage growth was at the high end of expectations at 0.4 percent. if strong wage gains persist, they may push inflation and interest rates higher.

on the other hand, some of what is done in the name of long term may be unmonitored waste. the observation that many unicorn companies with no profits, and sometimes no revenue or even fully developed products, get valued so highly makes me skeptical of the idea that the capital market is systematically myopic. it is also the case that the companies generating the highest immediate cash flows — which should be overvalued on the myopia theory — historically have had the highest stock market returns, implying undervaluation rather than overvaluation.
the iphone xr in particular struggles to convince chinese consumers, as the wall street journal's yoko kubota noted. the xr hasn't sold as expected in china because it is being passed over by both price-conscious buyers and status seekers, analysts say, kubota wrote. some chinese consumers have perceived the sticker price of 6,499 yuan, or about $945, to be too expensive even though it is at least 25% cheaper than the higher-end iphone xs and xs max models.

on all those fronts, the new administration will have its work cut out. on climate, any collaboration with china — the world's biggest carbon emitter but also an emerging green-tech giant — will be met with republican fury at home. on iran, the landscape has markedly changed after four years of trumpist maximum pressure; trust between all parties is low. on challenging authoritarianism and upholding liberal values, the mixed record of biden's own time in office as vice president — which saw the sputtering of democratic revolutions in the arab world and unchecked military adventurism by russia — suggests that a liberal renaissance may not be around the corner.

roy's logic: if the presidential result was tainted, so was the outcome of those house races, which employed the same ballot procedures, signature validations, and judgments by state executive and judicial branch officials.
before she entered politics, warren was an academic studying consumer bankruptcy, and much of her focus in office has followed that vein. but as she outlined her agenda in iowa, warren expanded beyond that: she proposed an anti-corruption bill that would ban lawmakers from becoming lobbyists, advocated stronger unions and touted a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote.

but tokyo's metropolitan intercity railway company garnered international attention last year when a train operator mistakenly departed the station 20 seconds early. the company issued a statement, saying that workers had failed to double-check the exact scheduled time of departure, 9:44:40 a.m., before pulling out of the station at 9:44:20 a.m. (still, they pointed out in the statement, there was no evidence that anyone had actually been left behind on the platform.)

trump aides say the world economic forum offers him an opportunity to sell his message to an international crowd. the president welcomes opportunities to advance his america first agenda with world leaders, white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said in a statement tuesday. at this year's world economic forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen american businesses, american industries and american workers.
at the outset of the runoff campaigns, political prognosticators noted that democrats historically have not fared well in such races in georgia. in a senate runoff in 2008, for example, the democratic candidate lost by 15 percentage points after a steep drop-off among black voters who had turned out in large numbers during the general election to support barack obama's bid to become the first black president. john mccain, the arizona senator and republican presidential nominee, won georgia that year.

richter, the spokeswoman for the american society of travel advisors, suggests using a professional to help make plans for the spring or summer.
states had to implement this new program from scratch in the spring when they were receiving millions of applications each week. many states are struggling to figure out what proof is acceptable to show a gig worker lost their job because of the pandemic or whether a parent truly left a job to care for a child. unemployment aid has typically replaced a little less than half of a worker's prior wages, but gig workers often have wages that fluctuate a lot from week to week, another challenge that requires case-by-case calculations.

the remaining brics (brazil, india, china and south africa), like many non-western states, did not demand assad stand down. china was most supportive, vetoing anti-assad u.n. security council resolutions six times since 2011, but india, too, retained ties to damascus, fearing the rise of islamists and possibly rewarding syria for its past pro-delhi stance on kashmir. brazil withdrew its ambassador to syria, but for safety reasons rather than an explicitly anti-assad action. even before the recent election of right wing pro-torture president jair bolsonaro, brazil stated its wish to restore full ties and take part in reconstruction.
bowser's proposal for a walkability preference would target an estimated 10,000 students who live more than a half mile away from their assigned traditional school but less than a half mile from a charter school. charter schools would not be required to offer an admission preference to those students, but they would be allowed to do so.
do not be confused: roy has been among the staunchest supporters and admirers of the president, and remains so. it is hard to see any political upside to his principled stand. he may have invited a primary challenge that could put the squeeze on him in a rapidly growing central texas district that democrats already see as a prime pickup opportunity.
but left-leaning economists note the proposal is hardly radical, given rates that high — and higher — were on the books for for the top income bracket amid the prosperous middle decades of the last century. and some recent research (including from nobel-winning economist peter diamond) argues a top rate slightly north of 70 percent is optimal for the ultra-rich. (the idea also drew praise from at least one figure on the right, with ann coulter tweeting she agrees.) julián castro, the former obama administration housing chief moving toward a presidential bid, pointed to history in endorsing ocasio-cortez's idea during a sunday appearance on abc's this week.
but biden also ran on confronting climate change, reforming the immigration system, strengthening labor unions, addressing income inequality and overhauling the criminal justice system — all ideas that will be met with significant republican resistance. all will test the decades-long dealmaking relationship that biden has touted with senate republican leader mitch mcconnell.

once-fanciful suggestions about organizing a draft campaign for romney or nikki haley, trump's former u.s. ambassador to the united nations, have suddenly turned more serious, the consultants and lawmakers said.
in recent days, trump has plotted with others how to get revenge against anyone who did not go along with him, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.).
guthrie understands how much climate change troubles his students, but he doesn't shy from talking about it. he confronts not only their fears, but also the political reality of denial and decades of inaction, all of which is disturbing to his students. it's like there's a paradigm shift, like when you learn that santa claus isn't real, he says. everything we teach them, that science is a tool for understanding the world, that adults are protecting you, falls apart. there's nothing to prepare them for this enormous problem that we simply haven't solved.
we added 5,000 people to our list this morning; we added 10,000 people to our list yesterday, steyer said. just look at the turnout on november 6: it broke records, and we think the people on our list turned out something between 75 and 80 percent. and subsequent to that, they literally can't get [an agreement] to keep the government open, and the most respected member of his cabinet resigned!
it sounds to me like the obama white house needs to state even more categorically that it will not under any circumstances approve interrogation techniques that violate the geneva conventions -- and it needs to do so on the record. a background briefing won't cut it -- even when a public schedule and multiple references by press secretary robert gibbs to greg in his press briefing makes it clear that the briefers were white house counsel greg craig and deputy white house counsel mary derosa.
administration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and trump's decision to demand wall funding. democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which trump had long asserted would be funded by mexico.

as we entered the stadium, the attendants handed each person a gift card. it only took a few minutes for word to spread among our group that the gift card was to donors choose, a nonprofit that helps teachers get materials they need for their classroom. considering the level of budget cuts to education occurring in many states, the impoverished students that many teachers teach and love, and the fact that the average teacher spends $500 to $1,000 per year of personal money on school supplies, we were thrilled to discover that the college football foundation was investing in classrooms and giving sports fans the opportunity to give to local teachers and students.
u.s. military leaders wanted to double down on a counterinsurgency strategy. the objective was to win the hearts and minds of the afghan people by protecting them from the taliban, limiting civilian casualties and building popular support for the new afghan government.

many individual federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the federalist society. rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. in that sense, the federalist society is a talent network and placement agency as well.

at times, the incentives led to sales to countries ill-equipped to use the complicated systems. nigeria bought a large shipment of crypto machines, but two years later, when there was still no corresponding payoff in intelligence, a company representative was sent to investigate. he found the equipment in a warehouse still in its original packaging, according to the german document.
the blueprint includes more than 50 proposals. there is not a single silver bullet that's going to reduce drug prices across the board, says aaron kesselheim, an associate professor and drug-pricing researcher who is a colleague of luo's at harvard medical school and brigham and women's hospital. some of the proposals are nonstarters, he argues, such as punishing other countries for the low prices they pay on drugs. (americans pay more for drugs than any other nationality, but the governments of many other developed countries regulate drug prices, which keeps them lower.) a better solution would be to focus on what makes our pharmaceutical market inefficient, kesselheim says. focusing on this concept of foreign freeloading is, i think, a political distraction.
america is a world leader ... in volatility. bloomberg's justina lee: as the world's largest and deepest equity market, the u.s. tends to be the relatively steady hand among volatile peers. not anymore. the country is at the epicenter of global market anxieties from trade to monetary tightening and an economic slowdown. the u.s. gauge of future volatility, the vix, has exceeded the equivalents in europe, hong kong and even emerging markets a few times over the past month. this is an anomaly that's become more commonplace since the market sell-off in february 2018.

the thing is, though, that would hardly be the case if trump won. that's both because trump would still wield much power as president and because the senate would stay under gop control even if it lost both seats. vice president pence would break the tie in a 50-50 senate.
the epa has not published estimates on how much it will cost to implement the rule and what effect it will have on public health.
visions of a robust liberal world order have given way to white papers on the return of great-power competition. that includes the new race over research and the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, which is predicted to add some $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. china has poured vast resources into its tech sector and is arguably the global pacesetter in the development and implementation of ai technologies, an advantage that has huge political implications. whoever leads in artificial intelligence in 2030 will rule the world till 2100, declared a recent policy briefing from the brookings institution.
below is a list of the largest single announced donations to selected schools in the district, maryland and virginia, according to information the schools provided. the figures are not adjusted for inflation. so a gift of, say, $10 million, made years or decades ago would have been more valuable than an identical donation made today. another caveat: donors often make multiple pledges that add up to major sums.

the appeal by 16 states and the district of columbia consists of a single paragraph that lays out the legal steps to this stage. but california attorney general xavier becerra, leading the opponents of the decision, and other coalition members heaped barbed words on the ruling, contending it is reckless, ludicrous and based on a flimsy legal theory, as various attorneys general put it.

i'm not as worried. to me, cruz's infelicitous tweet read like the kind of unfortunate mistake you make when you forget someone is jewish, rather than when you target them for it. while jews may see two 78-year-old jewish men running against each other (arguing about who's had more stents and who has more houses, like at the kiddush in a conservative shul), that's not how america writ large perceives this race. sanders and bloomberg are barely registering in mainstream politics as jewish. it's a remarkable, final gift from the goldeneh medinah — the golden land, as yiddish-speaking immigrants once called the united states — at a time when american jews have never needed it more.

no matter what some of our members may think of mr. trump's agenda on immigration and border security, we know that all of them, they need their paychecks and they can't go to the grocery store, pay their rent or their child-care expenses with their love of a wall along the u.s.-mexican border, simon said. we know our members and every single agency affected by the shutdown are terrified that when the day comes that there's no paycheck on payday.
participants read news stories on one of three topics: criticizing the obama administration's nuclear deal with iran; supporting the development of nuclear weapons by japan, south korea and saudi arabia; and using nuclear weapons to destroy isis. the iran deal story represents a typical republican foreign policy position, while the other two stories advocate major changes to u.s. grand strategy. all three were positions that trump took during the campaign.
it was another matter for patriots defensive coordinator matt patricia to emerge from the patriots' plane following their ride home from houston wearing a shirt depicting goodell wearing a clown nose. that might play well with the patriots' base. but it doesn't necessarily play well elsewhere. not everyone agrees that brady and the patriots were victimized by an injustice; far from that. patricia isn't a fan or even a player. he has interviewed for nfl head coaching jobs. if and when the time comes for an owner of another franchise to make a decision about whether to hire him, patricia could have to answer for that.

the iowa caucuses remain 13 months away, but a pent-up demand for change in the white house is tangible among democrats eager for the 2020 campaign to start in earnest. the throngs of voters bombarding events in iowa are testament to something fearful for republicans: the huge tide of democratic voters who powered the party's 2018 gains have not lost interest as attention turns to the 2020 presidential race.

this matters a great deal to ecuador's political stability. under a weaker government, the muerte cruzada (mutual death) provision in article 148 of the 2008 constitution gives the president the option to dissolve the national assembly — and simultaneously cut short his own term. the government would then call for new legislative and presidential elections, with the incumbent allowed to govern by decree on urgent economic matters in the interim.

indeed, the appearance of bias in these cases is just as important as actual bias, said leonard downie jr., a former editor of the washington post.
the georgia runoff has an explicitly racist history. in an hour-long special episode of the excellent post reports podcasts, our colleagues martine powers and ted muldoon report the runoff system was conceived in the 1960s by a staunch segregationist who proclaimed that runoffs would prevent the negro bloc vote from controlling the elections. you can find a full transcript of their report here, but the part about the jim crow origins of the runoff system starts at about the 26-minute mark. essentially, the georgia system was invented to subvert the mandates of the voting rights act and ensure white candidates for statewide offices would always have an edge. even now, the runoff system essentially serves to ensure many votes from black, brown, rural, and low-income people don't ultimately get counted. it's a fascinating, albeit depressing, story.

in government, trump has cycled through a series of top advisers, often frustrated that he hasn't found people he thinks he can trust. instead, he focuses on the one thing he can always measure — the value of a deal. as trump put it in a speech in 2004: watch out for people, even [those] close to you, because in the end, if it's a choice between you and them, they're usually going to choose themselves. . . . you really have to think of yourself as a one-man show.

the top federal prosecutor in atlanta left his position on monday without warning. in the call with raffensperger, trump referred to him angrily as the never trumper u.s. attorney in atlanta as he complained that criminal charges were not being pursued over what the president claims, without evidence, is voter fraud. byung j.

according to four administration officials who are involved in the debate, haley has been pushing for a total cut in u.s. funding for unrwa in response to the palestinian authority's actions following trump's dec. 6 announcement that the united states was officially recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel. in late december, haley said the trump administration was taking names of those who voted for a resolution condemning the move.

it's not hard to see a similar dynamic playing with romo, who recovered this season from a back injury, not the first of his career. the broncos still have a terrific defense, talent at wide receiver and running back and, just as importantly, a potential need at his position and the ability to absorb a hefty contract.

to get a better sense of who benefits from loan forgiveness, we analyzed data from a 2019 survey of consumer finances conducted by the federal reserve board of governors, including 5,777 households. using the present value of loans (which lowers the figure if part of the loan is eventually likely to be forgiven) changes the picture, we found: if a comprehensive loan-forgiveness program were passed, we calculate that the average person in the top 10 percent of earners would receive $5,944 in forgiveness, while the average individual in the bottom 10 percent of earners would receive $1,070.

senior white house officials, alarmed by gaps in the u.s. supply chain for responding to the coronavirus, have also begun studying potential measures to improve the united states' capacity for producing drugs and necessary medical equipment. this month, as the outbreak accelerated, a team of white house officials traveled to the virginia biotechnology research park in richmond for a tour of a facility piloting the production of generic pharmaceuticals.
a few years ago i might have said, 'no, no [to ramshaw], things are gradually changing and getting better, and we'll get there,'  murdoch said. but the rejection of a female candidate in the 2016 election was a wake-up call: it was a turning point to realize that things don't just naturally get better over time, you have to actively participate and make them get better, and there's always a risk of backsliding.
despite these positives, assad's road to full rehabilitation remains blocked by three significant obstacles: the united states, the european union and nato-ally turkey. the united states seems the most immovable of these. while trump's shock decision to withdraw troops from syria boosts assad's stated desire to reconquer, every inch, of territory, there is no indication this will come alongside any softening toward damascus. pro-israel and anti-iran voices in washington make it unlikely u.s. sanctions will be lifted anytime soon. these restrictions on u.s. companies and citizens dealing with or financing any work in syria remain problematic and deter international investors.

generally, the president has vast discretion in issuing visas. one of the major arguments against the executive order is that while in principle a president can limit immigration from the seven affected countries, it would be unconstitutional for president trump in particular to do so, because in his case the action is motivated by impermissible religious bias. the central exhibit for this argument is his campaign statements about a muslim ban.

republican and campaign officials said among the steps that could be taken to punish romney are continued attacks on twitter or through paid advertisements. trump allies could also help fund an opponent in his state, although he's not up for reelection until 2024, or push operatives or donors not to support or work for him. white house officials could block policy or budget priorities that romney wants, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.

jan. 13, 2019, issue: decision time is here. no, not yet for you, dear voter. but, rather, for the men and women who will announce their candidacy for the democratic nomination for president. those looking to unseat president trump may end up joining a free-for-all of at least a dozen candidates. for their campaigns to get any traction before the iowa caucuses next year, they'll need to get ahead of the pack. artist matt huynh hopes the primaries provide a more inspiring model than the 2016 election. i'm optimistically, and i'm sure naively, hoping that the 2020 elections can cathartically reassure voters of the soundness of the democratic process.
the first doses of vaccine mark only the beginning of the end of the pandemic. ahead of us lie the nightmares of dealing with the issue that many high-risk factors overlap with social factors. ethnic minorities and the poor are at greater risk both of catching the virus and of sustaining serious harm from it if they do. if governments around the world decide to give them priority (and both kant and mill might well agree that they should), will that decision be communicated clearly enough to gain acceptance among those who have to wait?
you know when a country sends us 200 soldiers to iraq or sends us 100 soldiers from a big country to syria or to afghanistan and then they tell me 100 times we sent you soldiers, we sent you soldiers. and that's 1/100 of the money that they are taking advantage of. they are just doing that to make me happy or to make past presidents happy. i've heard past presidents, well, they're involved in the afghanistan war because they sent us 100 soldiers and yet it's costing us billions and billions of dollars.
in 2012, the colts released peyton manning, knowing that they were set to draft andrew luck with the no. 1 overall pick. another factor in that decision was that indianapolis had salary-cap issues while manning was set to make a huge amount of money (he was due a $28 million roster bonus), which also made him nearly impossible to trade.

on one hand, the federal government and many republicans are wary of imposing too many security mandates on states for fear of undermining a constitutional balance of powers that gives states broad authority to manage their own elections. on the other hand, states simply aren't equipped to defend themselves against an ultrasophisticated hacking operation backed by russia or another cybersecurity adversary.

finally, trump's willingness to demonize certain people (mexicans, muslims and the media) while accepting unacceptable behavior from others (white supremacists, racists and armed radicals) damaged the nation. make america great again was a fine slogan as long as it pertained only to business or military strength. but we soon learned that maga also stood for whiteness and the good old days when white men were in charge.
both bersin and kropp also see greater adoption of workplace tech tools that nudge managers or employees via texts or other alerts that could divert users, too, from traditional emails (though the nudges are likely to come through email initially, too). from reminding managers with a phone alert that an employee in a competitive field hasn't had a raise to nudging people within an hr software system about using their remaining days of paid time off, artificial intelligence is likely to do more and more to urge behaviors among managers and employees. (former google hr chief laszlo bock is behind one start-up working in this area, humu.)

the revelation of redl's treason just before the outbreak of world war i inflated the case's significance in the public imagination. over time, the tale of the traitorous, gay spy became lore, especially among intelligence professionals, dramatized onstage and in film. five decades after redl was handed a pistol and instructed to take his own life as punishment for treason, central intelligence agency director allen dulles included an account of the legend in an anthology he edited and wrote elsewhere that the austrian colonel suffered from two weaknesses — homosexuality and overwhelming venality.

despite trump's rhetoric, it's not surprising that his 2016 base was rather interventionist. trump's strongest supporters in the primary and general election were distinguished by their ethnocentric support for whites over minority groups. and americans with such beliefs tend to have more-hawkish views about foreign policy in general and the war on terror in particular.
it's not as if pelosi has been easy on trump. at a private meeting after their now-infamous oval office meeting last month, she allegedly commented that the border wall must be a manhood thing for trump. yet even that insult did not invoke a twitter tirade from the president. he has slammed democrats generally for not giving him funding for the wall, but he hasn't gone after pelosi personally.
tom ballentine, vice president of public policy and government relations for the commercial real estate development association naiop, said the existing law was designed to promote retention of the most ecologically valuable forests.

treasury yields fell from a week ago, helping to drive mortgage rates down to start the year, len kiefer, deputy chief economist at freddie mac, said in a statement. despite increases in short-term interest rates, long-term interest rates remain subdued. the 30-year mortgage rate is down a quarter of a percentage point from where it was a year ago, and the spread between the 30-year fixed and 5/1 adjustable rate mortgage is the lowest since 2009. with the [federal open market committee] minutes showing continued support for gradual increases in policy rates from many participants and inflation rates remaining low, there isn't much upward pressure on long-term rates at the moment. whether that changes due to a tighter labor market and the economic impact of tax reform remains to be seen.
the nation's public health laboratories, exasperated by the malfunctioning tests in the face of a global public health emergency, have taken the unusual step of appealing to the food and drug administration for permission to develop and use their own tests. in hawaii, authorities are so alarmed about the lack of testing ability that they requested permission from the cdc to use tests from japan. a medical director at a hospital laboratory in boston is developing an in-house test, but is frustrated that his laboratory won't be able to use it without going through an onerous and time-consuming review process, even if demand surges.

goodlatte's plan would grant legal status to daca recipients, provide funding for a border wall, end a visa lottery program criticized by trump, take action against sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and roll back rules allowing legal immigrants to sponsor the entry of certain family members. but house republican leaders do not think the bill will be able to garner enough support to pass by the deadline.
even if we imagine that the value of the dollar could instantly rise by 25%, circumventing the adjustment process, the list of unintended consequences would still be immense. much of the world's public and private debt is denominated in dollars, and a rapid increase in the value of the dollar would cause massive financial upheavals and bankruptcies. a 25% increase in the dollar's value would imperil american investments abroad—including hundreds of billions of dollars in private and state pension funds and university endowments. the domestic tourism industry, which does not get a tax subsidy on its sales to foreigners visiting the u.s., would be devastated.

all of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the federal reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. there is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. first, credit is already cheap. but more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.

politically, the industry petition comes at a significant time. it was filed days after the departure of one democratic commissioner, jessica rosenworcel, and just weeks before the agency's most senior democrat, tom wheeler, is due to step down. both moves will leave the fcc with a two-republican majority and a one-democrat minority, allowing the gop to begin repealing regulations almost as soon as president-elect donald trump is sworn into the oval office.
it's the latest clash in a long-running debate over religious freedom and government social services, as three successive administrations have considered how much religion is too much religion when agencies are collecting taxpayer funds. the trump administration's response in the south carolina case will signal whether it will adhere to modest limits imposed by the bush and obama administrations or whether it will allow religious entities a freer hand.
thomas faha, the state deq's regional director, responded in a dec. 19 letter that deq believes the city exceeded the public participation requirements of the permit and [combined sewer overflow] policy and that given the council's november action, alexandria's public participation has been sufficiently robust such that there is no need for another public meeting.
-- trump's campaign is devoting extensive resources to ensure the 2020 republican convention is a smooth advertisement for his reelection. politico's alex isenstadt reports: the president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when never trump republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national tv audience. … for trump adversaries, the possibilities for mischief in charlotte would be endless. they could attempt headline-grabbing floor protests, demand prime-time speaking slots for presidential detractors, or even wage a long-shot bid to nominate someone else. the campaign is so focused on ensuring the convention is a smooth-running affair devoid of presidential critics that it's building out an entire wing of the campaign devoted solely to the endeavor. the initiative appears to be unique in both how early it's been launched and how far-reaching it is.
on the one hand, boosting growth in the export-dependent nation following a sharp global recession. on the other, doing so without further upsetting the u.s., its biggest export market. the u.s. put vietnam on notice in october by opening a trade investigation into its currency policy and then imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties on vietnamese car and truck tires, citing an undervalued currency. in december, the u.s. treasury designated the southeast asian country a currency manipulator, which comes with no immediate penalties but can escalate trade tensions. vietnam's authorities will be keen to secure greater access to american consumers while tamping down concerns about the surging trade surplus, on pace in 2020 to break the previous year's record $56 billion.
one thing that gets lost is how compassionate the pro-life movement is, he said. to help women who have gone through the pain of abortion, to help single mothers, to give them resources through thousands of pregnancy centers: this is the face of the pro-life movement.
i hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting flynn go. he is a good guy. i hope you can let this go. flynn is a good guy. comey felt that was as much as he could say. he did not commit to letting flynn go — which he saw as an inappropriate directive to end the investigation.

our senior leadership team never set up a process like this — that is, a process that identifies broad categories of contracts, at modest financial levels, that must be kicked upstairs to headquarters for political sign-off, hayes added. to the contrary, we recognized that government contract processes are complex, and that political interference would sully the integrity of contracting processes that applicants have a right to expect are governed with fairness, impartiality, and integrity as their guide.
any attempt by iraq to follow through with the expulsion of u.s. troops, trump later threatened, would be met with a refusal to leave and sanctions on iraq like they've never seen before, ever.
vice president pence mentioned the roe v. wade anniversary, saying, forty-five years ago, the supreme court turned its back on the inalienable right to life. but in that moment, our movement began. he praised trump as the most pro-life president in american history and vowed, with god's help, we will restore the sanctity of life to the center of american law.
the pilot feasibility study, a collaborative effort between a harvard medical school physician, the health insurer anthem and ibm was designed to test whether employees and insurers would both benefit from putting more power in the hands of patients.

this is the sort of thing you can expect to learn more about on you make me sick, a new podcast from the environmental defense fund's health program. hosted by jennifer mcpartland, a senior scientist with the health program, and jonathan choi, a chemical policy fellow there, it features chatty interviews with environmental-health experts who break down the latest findings in their fields.
scientists say 70 to 80 percent of us must, in order for all to be protected against the virus. polls showed acceptance of the idea edging into that range as 2020 ended. and that was before a campaign to persuade the reluctant began in earnest. so when will life return to normal?
in the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to read different news stories about republican candidates making statements about u.s. nuclear weapons policy, which has been a stable foundation of u.s. grand strategy.
warren, a member of the senate armed services committee, told interviewer rachel maddow that after 17 years of war there remain lots of different problems in afghanistan, and what seems to be the answer from the foreign policy establishment? 'stay forever.' that is not a policy. we can't do that.

in the case of the $21 trillion, ocasio-cortez was suggesting that this was all pentagon waste and that cleaning it up could pay for two-thirds of the estimated $32 trillion price tag for single-payer health care, which she and others are referring to as medicare-for-all.

a year after the scene at the playground, i was sipping home-brewed coffee across the kitchen table from two women i had just met. our daughters were awkwardly stealing glimpses of one another over an art project meant to be an icebreaker. the girls were about to start kindergarten at a public magnet school.
the deal signing came after a seven-day reduction in violence in which u.s., afghan and taliban forces pledged not to carry out offensive operations. the agreement does not specify whether that commitment would continue. instead, it notes that a cease-fire would need to be agreed upon in intra-afghan talks that are expected to start in 10 days.
kavanaugh, gorsuch, alito and thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of supreme court justices for the annual affair. there's also a trio of trump's once and future justice department leaders: deputy attorney general rod rosenstein (alumnus of the federalist society's harvard law school chapter), recently fired attorney general jeff sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general matthew whitaker (recommended by leonard leo to be sessions's chief of staff). it's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the justice department are minor actors compared with the federalist society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.
and, he added, the president believes all of it.
concha declined to comment for this article but said on twitter that he bought the followers on the recommendation of a friend, a social-media expert, to enhance [my] brand. he described it as one-and-done and later seemed to dismiss the value of the practice: net-net: nobody cares if you have 47k or 42k followers.

everyone complains about their bosses. everyone gets testy with their longtime mates. it doesn't always mean you want to divorce, or quit, or tear down all you've built. brady's unexpected good health and mvp level of play at age 40 undeniably has put the patriots in a unique kind of limbo, and no doubt it comes with tension. especially given his reliance on the highly unconventional health guru, alex guerrero, whose special access undoubtedly angered the conventional medical and training staffs — who have reason to be territorial and defensive given brady's very public rejection of their pill-needle-and-knife care.
and landlords continue to discriminate against voucher holders, according to a recent hud study. communities where landlords are more likely to deny renting to voucher holders also tend to have tighter rental markets and less-generous payment standards for housing vouchers.
the united nations' intergovernmental panel on climate change said in 2018 that policymakers have just 12 years to avert the worst consequences of global warming; news coverage is constantly filled with apocalyptic stories of storms and wildfires. young people, absorbing the gravity of these warnings, have become the defining face of the climate movement — marching, protesting and berating their elders for bequeathing them an uncertain, unstable future. underlying their anger, though, is another a-word: anxiety. and it's something they're increasingly voicing. teachers hear their students talk about panic attacks when wildfires break out, and psychologists face young patients weeping about their fear of never having a family. amber bray recalls colin solemnly telling her on his eighth birthday, my life would be better without climate change.
the alliance also wrote questions for the lawmakers to ask leonhart.
but none of that had much to do with acquainting voters with what warren stands for.

a spokeswoman for the state attorney's office in hillsborough county, which made the decision to drop the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on thursday.
government watchdogs and journalists have chronicled severe shortcomings with the afghan security forces over the years. but the interview records obtained by the post contain new insights into what went wrong and expose gaping contradictions between what u.s. officials said in public and what they believed in private as the war unfolded.
sinks said he also worries that tuesday's final rule deepens the broader attack on science by the trump administration, and that it could have a lasting impact that goes beyond any single regulation.

people have long been comfortable with gold because they can touch it, store it, look at it and make things with it. unlike real estate, it's fungible. you can move it from one place to another, even from one country to another, and still sell it at the world rate. that is not always true for other valuables. try packing your suitcase with oil or paintings, cocoa beans or cattle.
to do so, however, trump may need the support not only of other political leaders but of the american public itself. our research suggests that his ability to shape public opinion may be quite constrained. we find that trump may be successful in mobilizing support among republicans and some independents — but only for typical republican policies. for policies that would change the 50 years of u.s. grand strategy, he will likely have difficulty changing public attitudes.
peduto said he is leaning toward bloomberg and buttigieg because the energy policy positions of sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.) and elizabeth warren (d-mass.) — who support a ban on fracking — would be devastating to the rust belt. conversely, biden's positions, he said, are more like donald trump's than they are a pragmatic approach toward the middle.

unions working with the nlrb typically have to deal with narrowly defined work groups, limited by type of worker or location, which makes it very easy for employers to attack, allen said.
the group is in negotiations with the afghan government in a bid to end the country's war. however, the taliban did not get to the negotiating table through violence alone. instead, the group waged a political campaign that required establishing support from afghan citizens as well as a greater degree of international legitimacy — and both of these goals played into the recent decision to make a deal with unicef.
mark butler, georgia's commissioner of labor, said his office has been working quickly to get money out, but it has also experienced a spike in fraudulent claims. more than 4.1 million applications have been processed, but 111,000 were from people who were fired or quit, which requires extra review, and more than 31,000 have been flagged as potentially fraudulent, he said.
furthermore, the servicers say the fcc's interpretation of its rulemaking authority under the telephone consumer protection act, a law that bans the use of autodialers to call and text people on their cellphones without permission, is impermissibly broad. that argument might strike a chord with pai, who as a commissioner dissented against the rules under the same pretense.

you need to have a very healthy media ecosystem in order to support a functioning democracy, and i look at everything we do as how do we find the actual crux of some of the problems rather than putting band-aids on them after they develop, murdoch said.
it's such a distortion of the teachings of jesus to say that what he taught us to do personally — to love our neighbors as ourselves, help the poor — can somehow be imputed on a nation. jesus never told caesar how to run rome. he went out of his way to say that's the earthly kingdom, i'm about the heavenly kingdom and i'm here to teach you how to treat others, how to help others, but when it comes to serving your country, you render unto caesar that which is caesar's. it's a distortion of the teaching of christ to say jesus taught love and forgiveness and therefore the united states as a nation should be loving and forgiving, and just hand over everything we have to every other part of the world. that's not what jesus taught. you almost have to believe that this is a theocracy to think that way, to think that public policy should be dictated by the teachings of jesus.
as the sole democrat on georgia's state election board on sunday urged raffensperger to investigate the president over the call, some lawyers and legal scholars said trump's actions indeed appeared to violate both state and federal criminal statutes.
gujjar, 19, helps his parents farm a small plot of land where they grow wheat and millet. a year ago, he tried to join the indian army, but he did not make the cut in a qualifying exam. there are no opportunities in his village in the district of ­jhunjhunu, he said, and most of his friends do not have steady work.
reformers refused to admit, at least publicly, that there are no miracles in education. student success takes hard work by young people and their teachers and parents, and it takes work not just around school policy but also with housing and health and fiscal and transportation policy.
'china's not doing very well now,' mr. trump said in a news conference at the white house, hours after the report came out on friday. 'it puts us in a very strong position. we are doing very well.' mr. trump is correct about china's economy, which by several measures appears to be hobbled by american tariffs on $250 billion worth of chinese imports. but the president's confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats.

his status as a substitute in montgomery was frozen nov. 1 after allegations surfaced about his participation in the charlottesville torchlight protest. district spokesman derek turner said a variety of claims was made, including that conte was involved in violence in charlottesville, but more needs to be known before the district decides on his final employment status.
several pieces of legislation are aimed at stemming violence in baltimore. miller has suggested adding 500 new police officers and creating a police academy at coppin state university. he also supports johns hopkins university's plan to create its own police department, an idea that sparked outrage from sen.-elect mary l. washington (d-baltimore city).
well, at least most of the time. repeatedly since joe biden was declared the winner nov. 7, trump has momentarily acknowledged the likelihood — if not the fact — that biden will be succeeding him as president later this month.
nikema said, 'we know they can be reached,'  poo said. and we would knock on these doors, and people would be so grateful to hear from us and say that nobody ever comes around here.
on the stage in albany, warnock is dressed in a light blue quarter-zip pullover, looking like a suburban dad returning from home depot with a bag of mulch. to counter the radical label warnock has expressed his support for police and the military (his dad was a veteran). in one ad he walks a dog along the sidewalk in front of suburban homes with picket fences. dogs are more often associated with white ownership.
but federal officials at hud understood back then that declaring free choice was not the same thing as making it so. in a precursor to the 1968 fair housing act, the department determined free choice housing policies, like the one in place in baltimore, were allowing segregation to continue in public housing projects. new guidelines released in 1967 required local housing authorities to maintain systemwide waiting lists of applicants and assign tenants based on the order of application, rather than allowing white applicants to hold out for an opening in a majority-white housing project. hud explained in a memo to housing authorities that freedom of choice plans did not afford freedom of choice in fact.
elusive $2,000 checks are among the items being considered: rep. hakeem jeffries (d-n.y.), chairman of the house democratic caucus, said that the $2,000 checks amount to 'unfinished business that should be continued as part of our effort to provide additional relief to the american people,' erica werner reports.
dejoy's agenda sent delivery rates spiraling. by august, periodicals had an on-time rate of 69 percent, an eight percentage-point drop in a matter of weeks. performance rebounded over the fall, then fell again during the holiday season. it stood at 54 percent the week of dec. 12, the most recent postal service data available.
the president believes in enforcing federal law, press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said. that would be his top priority. that is regardless of what the topic is, whether it's marijuana, or whether it's immigration, the president strongly believes we should enforce federal law.

on the other hand, high schoolers are still high schoolers, with homework and soccer practice and dates and part-time jobs. and teenagers i spoke with admitted that activism can be a burden. i'd love to not be doing this. i'd much rather be hanging out with my friends, watching something stupid on netflix, says jonah gottlieb, 17, a high school senior in california. i have to because adults have left us no choice.
for his part, crocker told government interviewers he agreed corruption was an enormous problem that had sabotaged the war effort. but by the time the kabul bank scandal struck, it was too late, he said.
but our research finds that loan forgiveness would benefit upper-income people even more than is generally understood. that's partly because few realize that a large loan forgiveness program for low-income borrowers already exists: many low-income borrowers are already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans that not only peg payments to wage levels but forgive loans after some period, typically 20 or 25 years.
u.s. has leverage in trade talks, trump says. alan rappeport and jim tankersley at the new york times: trump is cheerleading his way past the economic warning signs that have rattled financial markets and unnerved economists, insisting that the united states has an advantage in a crucial first round of trade negotiations beginning on monday in beijing. it helps his case that the labor department published a jobs report for december that soared past expectations.
the order will increase to $172,500 a salary cap that applies to employees in the uppermost levels of the general schedule in some areas, including the washington-baltimore area. for most career executives and others at senior career levels, a cap of $199,300 will apply; most of them are paid within a range and receive raises based on performance ratings.

mr. stewart, 79, died jan. 4 in miami, according to his son adam stewart, who now takes over the sandals resorts international empire and who did not give a specific cause of death. he did say that his father had received a recent medical diagnosis but had kept it quiet so as not to worry his friends or workers. in may last year he had donated $31.5 million to jamaican authorities to help families suffering from the coronavirus.

today's proposal will involve changes to the way the law is implemented, and it will be up to the federal courts to decide whether those changes are faithful to the law, huber said.
rogue doctors wrote fraudulent prescriptions for enormous numbers of pills, and complicit pharmacists filled them without question, often for cash. internet pharmacies, supplied by drug distribution companies, allowed users to obtain drugs without seeing a doctor.
in many of those cases, kratom was used along with other drugs, making it difficult for authorities to determine the actual cause of death. kratom proponents have said the government sometimes blames kratom for deaths caused by other substances, but the new fatality cited by the fda, given the absence of other substances, reinforces our concerns, gottlieb said.
state unemployment offices stressed that most people still waiting for aid don't qualify for the regular unemployment aid program. instead, these people believe they qualify for the new program congress created in march called pandemic unemployment assistance, or pua, that is meant to help gig workers, self-employed workers and parents who had to stop working to take care of a sick relative or watch a school-aged child when schools shut down in-person education.
in their search for answers, there was enough blame to go around. his family blamed the broken health-care system. they blamed unaffordable insurance and high out-of-pocket costs. they blamed a lot of things, including, in darker moments, themselves. but they kept coming back to the price of insulin. why was a treatment that had been around for nearly 100 years so expensive? and what could be done about it?
there's been an underlying assumption that there is not only a method to this war, but that it carries political benefits for trump. that was probably true during the 2016 election: the media's wide-eyed wonder at the trump spectacle reduced his primary opponents to afterthoughts. it also meant that stories that would have ended the presidential bids of ordinary candidates were reported briefly and then pushed aside. meanwhile, the media treated hillary clinton as someone who is fundamentally corrupt and whose every move should be greeted with screaming 72-point headlines.
trump's nss changes direction once again. it does include the assertion that since societies that empower women to participate fully in civic and economic life are more prosperous and peaceful, the united states will support efforts to advance women's equality, protect the rights of women and girls, and promote women and youth empowerment programs. but that's as far as it goes, offering no statement that women's rights are critical to national and international security.

without any structural support for integration, however, segregation remained in place. those few projects that saw any racial change at all quickly flipped from being all-white to having all-black residents. that's because lower-class white baltimoreans, accessing racially biased programs including federally insured home loans and gi bill benefits, moved in droves to the suburbs.
but obama added a last-minute wrinkle that caught many of his senior advisers by surprise. he imposed a timeline on the mission and said the extra troops would start to come home in 18 months.
dozens of u.s. and afghan officials told interviewers that the problems reflected a much deeper flaw. despite years and years of war, the united states still did not understand what was motivating its enemies to fight.

it's a lot in america, antetokounmpo said. as giannis, i stand for change. my team stands for change. every time we see something that's not right, we're going to speak about it and use our platform the right way. this really bothers me. my kid is going to grow up here in america, and my kid is black. i can't imagine my kid going through what i've seen on the tv.
unlike many republican wonks in washington, trump was never interested in removing syrian president bashar al-assad from power. in december, he perfunctorily declared that the islamic state had been defeated — despite mountains of evidence to the contrary — and said it was largely the responsibility of turkey and other arab countries to carry on the fight.
the projects are in the planning, design or construction stages, even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on travel patterns and the lives of restaurant, office and hospitality workers. they came together because of the arrival of amazon's second headquarters in arlington, which was announced two years ago. many of the projects had been in the discussion or planning stages earlier than that, but the amazon decision accelerated the plans.
then-defense secretary mark t. esper and gen. mark a. milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, argued behind the scenes against invoking the insurrection act to allow trump to employ active-duty troops in the nation's capital. but they came under intense criticism over public statements and appearances that seemed to support trump's heavy-handed response to civilians in the streets, which included the use of tear gas and rubber pellets to disperse protesters near the white house before trump posed for photos with a bible in front of st. john's church.
as far as e.u.-u.s. relations are concerned, the deal's timing seems unfortunate. in an interview with cnn's fareed zakaria aired sunday, jake sullivan, biden's pick for white house national security adviser, stressed the incoming administration's desire to meet with like-minded allies and move past the distrust sown during trump's bruising time in office.
that same day, which was swearing-in day for the new congress, roy went one gutsy step further. he challenged the seating of 67 house members from the six states where trump has claimed, without evidence, that victory was stolen from him.
the point here isn't to idealize bolivia's socialists: the country remains badly governed in important ways. corruption remains endemic in bolivia's public sector, with most infrastructure contracts given out on a no-bid basis to ruling-party cronies. and while nowhere near as extreme as venezuela's turn to dictatorship, bolivia's political scene has seen worrying authoritarian drift, closing down the spaces for dissent that any proper democracy needs to function.

clinton campaign. the conspirators then used that account to send spearphishing
intelligence agencies knew as early as 2015 that the russians had penetrated the systems of the democratic national committee, but it wasn't until the election cycle hit full force that many of the leaks began to surface. throughout the summer months, republican presidential candidate donald trump continued to reject the intelligence on russia's involvement, while democratic candidate hillary clinton was dogged by an email scandal that resurfaced time and time again.
and wanda would thus be treated as still married to xavier (whom she had divorced under elbonian law many years ago), and not to harry. at best, she would considered harry's putative spouse, which means she'd be treated as harry's wife for this dispute — but would lose that status the moment the court informs her that her elbonian divorce is invalid. she would have to somehow redivorce xavier under montana law, though he's still back in elbonia, and then remarry harry.

asian americans — some of them at least — have made tremendous progress in the united states. but the greatest thing that ever happened to them wasn't that they studied hard, or that they benefited from tiger moms or confucian values. it's that other americans started treating them with a little more respect.
my question is: why in the world would @realdonaldtrump renominate kathleen hartnett white to chair the council on environmental quality after her disastrous nomination hearing in november?? he wrote. she is wildly unqualified to serve in this position — she outright rejects basic science.

update: bloomberg's team has released a statement saying: president trump's deleted tweet is the latest example of his endless efforts to divide americans. i inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. by the time i left office, i cut it back by 95 percent, but i should've done it faster and sooner. i regret that, and i have apologized — and i have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on black and latino communities.
officials are particularly concerned about the potential for iranian attacks within the next few days, now that the mourning period for soleimani has ended. we are seriously concerned about the next 24 to 48 hours, said a u.s. official who was not authorized to address the issue publicly.

here are some of the higher-profile players who potentially could be released:
pelosi led a congressional delegation to afghanistan in march last year. our meetings confirmed that afghanistan has come a long way with the support of the u.s. and other international partners but formidable challenges remain, she said at the time.
we hope more residents and organizations will join in and d.c. officials will commit to a comprehensive plan that puts these principles first so that new housing could be created, affordable housing could be preserved, judges could be unconfused and the vision of an inclusive d.c. could be achieved.
pentagon leaders are bracing for any renewed presidential attempts to employ the military for political ends, paul sonne, missy ryan and ellen nakashima report. top pentagon officials, in answering a request by d.c. mayor muriel e. bowser (d) to deploy national guardsmen in the nation's capital in advance of wednesday's protests, emphasized that the guard wouldn't carry firearms, use armored vehicles or helicopters, or receive backup from units in other states — a far more muted presence than in june after the minneapolis police killing of george floyd. the careful posture reflects the pentagon's wariness in the final days of a presidency during which trump has tested the norms of a politically impartial military. … a senior u.s. official said tuesday that the pentagon senior leadership — civilian and military — will not obey an unlawful order from the president to use the military to his own political ends. these leaders likely would resign before following an unlawful order, the senior official said.
back in washington, national security officials in the obama administration were surprised by russia's mild reaction. but trump tweeted an appreciative response.

the money from mgm needs to go into the classrooms to elevate the status of teachers, to lower classroom size, to provide pre-k and to provide also for career readiness technology for those students who aren't on the path to college and need careers, he said.
march 24-26: one of the largest annual political events in the country, the aipac policy conference, will be held in downtown washington. traditionally, the off-year sessions don't give many speaking slots to presidential candidates; that's reserved for election years. but the event, anchored by a lengthy speech from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, is built to showcase the clout of pro-israel lobbyists, and worries about declining support for israel among democratic voters have become a topic there.
yet child-care subsidies are severely underfunded, said hannah matthews, director of child care and early education for the center for law and social policy (clasp). more federal and state investment is sorely needed to expand access to subsidies to reverse the declining numbers of children served.
the city counts students for its final enrollment tally in october. jennifer c. niles, the district's deputy mayor for education, said even though this week's report showed a decrease, she expects enough students may transfer into traditional public schools by the end of the year that enrollment will inch up.
pelosi told elle magazine in a recent interview that she views the vitriol thrown her way by republicans and some democrats not as hatred but as respect.
the point here is not to quarrel with these policy choices (although there is much to quarrel with) or to suggest that blackstone has benefited more than other firms (although that is probably the case). rather, it is to illustrate that the amount that schwarzman or anyone else earns in any year in the marketplace is determined in no small part by rules and norms that govern market competition.

the new outlook also gives enormous leverage to centrist democrats such as sen. joe manchin iii (d-w.va.), because losing even one democratic vote on any major initiative could mean its doom. the more far-reaching actions demanded by liberals — such as ending the filibuster, granting statehood to puerto rico and d.c., and expanding the supreme court — remain almost certainly out of reach.
the document also makes bold but unverified claims about the effects of the operation, saying that it provided the decisive margin in an election decided by fewer than 22,000 voters — moving enough votes to ensure a doug jones victory.
chiefly responsible for business and trade, commerce focuses on domestic and global economic performance. its agencies include the census bureau, the patent and trademark office and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration.
fed loan program for midsize firms had few takers: washington was happy to rely on the fed because it had the chops to get a program for medium-size businesses up and running fast. its apolitical reputation reduced concern about loans being steered to big donors. the treasury department became a fed partner to absorb any loan losses, the wall street journal's nick timiraos reports.
the law and common sense prevailed over special interests today, john moore, director of the sustainable ferc project coalition, said in a statement. the ferc correctly found that the department of energy's proposal violated the basic requirements of the federal power act. secretary perry's plan would have subsidized coal and nuclear plants with a 90-day fuel supply yet perry never explained why those plants were inherently more reliable or resilient.
the present bill, in the current form, doesn't do much to reassure this is a long-term, viable insurance product, molina said. i'm actually more concerned about medicaid and what this is going to do to our safety net.
while house democrats' demand for paper ballots is pretty tough, the mandate is worth it, bernhard told me. a paper ballot is better than a digital ballot with a physical paper trail, he told me, because it guards against sophisticated hackers making a voting machine record one vote but spit out a paper receipt for another.
peter wagner, executive director of the prison policy initiative, said it was difficult to spot trends among the states putting incarcerated people near the front of the line. connecticut, wagner said, is a big reformer, but some other states pursuing significant criminal justice reform have not publicly committed to early vaccination of inmates.
once students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. kaytlin roholt graduated from the university of pennsylvania law school in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to senate judiciary committee chairman charles grassley during the gorsuch nomination, and now practices at jones day and is a member of the steering committee of the federalist society's d.c. chapter for young lawyers. regardless of where i am, i know that a federalist society event is a place where i can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. what we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.
i share the concerns of many voters across the country about irregularities in the presidential election. i also share their disappointment with president trump's loss. however, the founders trusted the states to decide elections, not members of congress.
buncombe voters rejected the retiring sheriff's endorsed candidate. they instead chose quentin miller, a retired police sergeant who embraced the findings of president barack obama's task force on 21st century policing. its report emphasized de-escalation training and urged officers to adopt a guardian — rather than a warrior — mind-set.
trump's tweet last month pushing baseless fraud claims and promoting the big protest on jan. 6 — be there, will be wild! — has become a central rallying cry. it was the top post on thedonald.win tuesday morning, and anonymous commenters saw it as a call to action: we've got marching orders, the top reply said.
it didn't matter that assessment experts repeatedly said standardized test scores should not be used for high-stakes decisions and are only a narrow window into how well a student is performing. administrators used them for big things anyway. they also insisted that every child could be assessed in some way, and in some places, officials forced even teenagers with the cognitive capacity of a 6-month-old to take standardized tests. one boy in florida had to take one even though he was born without the cognitive part of his brain.
the idea has even been mooted in the tax-wary united states — most notably during world war ii, when president franklin d. roosevelt proposed a maximum income of $25,000. though congress ultimately balked at that idea, it did subsequently impose a record top tax rate of 94 percent on all income higher than $200,000.
political action committees representing the industry contributed at least $1.5 million to the 23 lawmakers who sponsored or co-sponsored four versions of the bill, including nearly $100,000 to marino and $177,000 to hatch. overall, the drug industry spent $102 million lobbying congress on the bill and other legislation between 2014 and 2016, according to lobbying reports.

henry worked through a french national named paul-émile soubiron, a sleazy con artist who helped henry recruit the favor of the french ambassador in washington. hoping that the documents would compel the united states to join france in war against britain, the ambassador used soubiron as a sort of shadow representative. like russian agents who peddle conspiracy theories of ukraine's collusion with democrats, the ambassador hoped to convince the president that they shared a british enemy who cooperated with a supposedly debased opposition party in america.
attorney jennifer levi, director of glad's transgender rights project, said the decision is based on the absurd idea that forcing transgender people to suppress who they are in order to serve is not a ban. it ignores the reality of transgender people's lives, with devastating consequences, and rests on a complete failure to understand who transgender people are. glad is an acronym for glbtq legal advocates and defenders.
throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and earlier in his presidency, trump told voters he would build a concrete wall, 30 feet tall in most places, to keep people out. he also promised that mexico would pay for the wall. since becoming president, though, he has shifted this promise, saying the money must come from u.s. taxpayers.

meanwhile, in georgia, we got an earful from republican officials outraged by president trump's attempt to strong-arm brad raffensperger, georgia's secretary of state, into changing vote totals there. gabriel sterling, a republican election official who previously denounced attempts to change the state's results and threats made against public officials, spoke on behalf of sane americans. i wanted to scream, he said of trump's call with raffensperger, during a news conference on monday.

nasdaq, which has submitted its proposal to the securities and exchange commission, is following the example of california, which requires firms based there to have at least one female director and, by 2023, one minority. that's a step forward but no guarantee of immediate change. in norway, which since 2008 has mandated that women compose 40 percent of corporate boards, a 2014 study found no improvement in firms' gender wage gaps or women promoted to senior executive ranks.
in remarks last year before the coronavirus began spreading out of control, polis said he would like to see colorado lead the nation in criminal justice reform. he issued an executive order in march allowing the department of corrections to reduce the state prison population, but the rule expired in may, and he faces litigation by the american civil liberties union of colorado accusing him and his corrections director of failing to protect vulnerable inmates.

the love affair between celebrities and instagram live is poised to grow in 2021. not only have direct broadcasts over the internet become an easy pandemic-era way for stars to endear themselves to fans with near-guaranteed publicity, but the celebrities have complete control over what they say. they don't need to write a witty caption or agonize over the perfect filter; viewers crave — and expect — authenticity in a spontaneous real-time chat.
one fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the george w. bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.

consider these facts drawn from a recent government accountability office report: 14.2 million children under age 13 met federal requirements for child-care subsidies in 2011-2012. of that number, 8.6 million were eligible under state policies. yet only 1.5 million children actually received the subsidies. that means only 10.6 percent of the number of children meeting federal guidelines actually get the subsidy.

the cause was cardiovascular disease, said a son, hampden macbeth.
trump and some conservative republicans have said the fight over wall funding is necessary now because it's the best point of leverage, believing democrats will rush to fund government programs and offer up some money in return for gop votes. that has proved not to be the case.
in trump's transactional view of the world, countries that he believes are doing better in one sphere (such as trade or receiving foreign aid) must pony up to settle accounts elsewhere. so, even though the united states is a large country with the most powerful military in the world, he mocks much smaller nations for contributing 100 or 200 soldiers to wars led by americans.
more broadly, pompeo asserted that the world is a safer place today, even as americans were urged to evacuate from iraq, and that the strike had decreased the chance of conflict with iran, even as thousands of additional american troops were reportedly being rushed to the middle east.

that is some screwed-up stuff. so the erik wemple blog asked the white house correspondents' association (whca) for its take on the situation, and this statement came forth from president margaret talev: it is longstanding practice for reporters to ask questions of the president during events like the one today, and it is at the president's discretion to decide whether and how to answer those questions. it is up to news organizations to determine which journalists they assign to represent them in the pool.

the eventual changes adopted by the sec in 2014 were weaker than what the fsoc had proposed. they incorporated liquidity fees and were greeted with cautious praise by industry players. now, those who wanted stronger regulations feel they have been vindicated. in march, as investors rushed to pull money out of the market during the first weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, the fed was forced to intervene, announcing it would establish a special backstop for money-market funds, among several other emergency actions. the industry was effectively bailed out again.

for the past 15 years warnock has been the senior pastor at the storied ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, the same church once led by his hero, martin luther king jr. the flamboyant, preacher-pol style that warnock cultivated at ebenezer may be alien to many americans, including many white christians. but it is deeply familiar to those who grew up in and around southern black churches. in those churches, preachers make it their business to tell uncomfortable truths about american life, including the shameful ways the country treats its african american citizens.

and consider the admonition from sen. patrick j. toomey (r-pa): the effort by senators hawley, cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like pennsylvania directly undermines the right to elect our leaders, he said in a written statement on monday. the senators justify their intent by observing that there have been many allegations of fraud. but allegations of fraud by a losing campaign cannot justify overturning an election. they fail to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in courtrooms across america and were found to be unsupported by evidence. so toomey is supposed to give a mulligan to the crew that undermines our democracy?

this is how the gop could survive: it must cut out the cancer on the party so the party can go forward and reinvigorate itself with new, sensible policies and values it once held (objective reality being my favorite). it can excise the lawless nihilism that threatens to blot out any policy or value republicans might hope to advance. if the gop does not act, the threat will metastasize, bringing down the whole lot of them.

several environmental groups, including the sunrise movement, have lined up in support of warnock and ossoff, even though neither candidate backs the deal, knowing that their success at the polls is the only way democrats can gain full control of congress.
compare that to how the executive branch has handled social media. the presidential records act, which went into effect in 1978, mandated that all official presidential records belong to the public. presidents have kept this law in mind even when using new technologies. for instance, when the white house joined snapchat in 2016, a senior obama white house official told buzzfeed that it would fully comply with those requirements, saving and preserving snaps for archives.
as u.s. officials debated their future in iraq, some allies began to evacuate their own troops following the parliamentary vote. the german government said the 100 or so troops it had based outside iraq's kurdistan region had been relocated to kuwait or jordan. canada said it would be withdrawing 500 troops from iraq.

during his victory speech on nov. 7, the president-elect referred to the south carolina primary. especially those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb, the african american community stood up again for me, biden said. you've always had my back, and i'll have yours.
then there's the conservative information bubble. trump wants his people to retreat further inside of it, so they'll never hear a discouraging word about him and his greatness. so how is that working out for him? is it keeping his approval ratings from being the lowest of any president in history at this point in his term? does it enable him to win arguments over things like whether he referred to shithole countries? is it keeping democrats from winning one stunning victory after another in off-year and special elections? is it going to stave off the anti-trump wave election in november that even some republicans now believe they can do nothing to stop?
but manning was undone by injuries. his body betrayed him. the neck injury that ended his colts' tenure could have ended his career. instead, he had a wondrous second act in denver. but he was, essentially, on borrowed time, and finally his body no longer could withstand the rigors of playing the game.
it is, experts said, a rare admission from the department that its reporting may have confused and misled the public. this is the government's statement on the risk of terrorism presented by foreign-born individuals in the united states, and it's critical that it be accurate — not just because the law requires it but because they have a duty to the american people to accurately report information of this type, said ben berwick, counsel for protect democracy, one of the groups that sued the government and is representing the others in court.
of course, a recorded voice is different from a live, unamplified voice, a point hume made in his review of margaret's 1951 release american songs. backed by the victor orchestra and the robert shaw chorale, margaret sang the works of six early american composers.
in that ruling, the fcc said the change would serve the public interest by providing for innovative device control features using touchless hand gesture technology. the fcc also said users can operate google soli devices aboard aircraft — but they remain subject to faa regulations on portable electronic devices.
even the lower end of that range of futures, however, can mean destructive storms, displacement and economic upheaval, and that's the reality that teachers have to communicate. to meghan duffy, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the university of michigan, the climate change lecture in her introductory biology course is the most important class she teaches. but, worried that the class might be overwhelming or not communicated well, she surveyed her students for a study published in 2019. after the climate change lesson, students knew more but felt worse: only 4 percent of the class thought humans would successfully address climate change. one student wrote in an anonymous survey, i understand that global warming is an important part of learning from this class, but at some point one of the lectures gave me an anxiety attack, so that wasn't fun.

since taking office, trump has repeatedly flouted norms governing presidential interactions with the military, signing his ban on travel from majority-muslim nations at the pentagon, diverting pentagon funds to pay for his border wall, treating troop events like campaign rallies and intervening in military justice matters. some of his orders to the pentagon, such as the holdup of congressionally approved military aid to ukraine and the diversion of military funds to construct the border wall, have later been deemed illegal.
half of the stories attributed the statements to donald trump, and the other half attributed the statements to paul evans, a fictional republican candidate for u.s. senate. we then asked participants their attitudes toward the iran deal, the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (npt), and the principle of no first use of nuclear weapons.

far and away the most interesting ideas factory on the right these days is the niskanen center, a sort of haven for lapsed libertarians who've discovered that simply shrinking government or disabling it is not a moral good. it's put out two of the most important pieces on the future of the right, the center can hold: public policy for an age of extremes (discussed here) and republicanism for republicans. the latter, written by the center's vice president for policy brink lindsey, postulates:
the investigation went nowhere. but, rannazzisi said, it destroyed me.
in 2011, obama ordered a partial, staged withdrawal of u.s. troops. with fewer americans in the fight, setbacks began piling up for the afghan security forces, and the taliban slowly seized more territory. but u.s. commanders kept telling the public everything was going according to plan.
scharzman and his partners have benefited handsomely from the favorable tax treatment for carried interest, and the ability to defer taxes on profitable investments that are exchanged for new ones. and under the new law, their taxes will be lower, and returns higher, as a result of the new lower rates for corporations and partnerships. the repeal of the estate tax will also leave wealthy families with more money to invest in blackstone funds.

in an interview, jerome said he suspects the department made errors in the data in its rush to push out a well-intentioned but ill-conceived rule before time ran out on the administration.
the other program is more utilitarian. this school of thinking, dating back to victorian liberal thinkers led by john stuart mill, holds that we should aim to seek the greatest good for the greatest number of people. sacrificing a few to save many, then, can be justified. this would lead to vaccinating those most likely to catch the virus and spread it, even if their mortality risk is low. doctors and emergency workers would go first, followed arguably by prisoners, people who come into contact with lots of other people, and those in communities that are particularly susceptible to spread. this is pretty much the course being followed by most states in the u.s.

in the interview documents obtained by the post, u.s. and nato officials partially blamed themselves for the predicament. they said they moved too slowly to build up the afghan forces during the first few years of the war when the taliban presented a minimal threat. then, after the taliban rebounded, they rushed and tried to train too many afghans too quickly.
it's more than just watching 'house of cards,' powell said. he's hoping faster broadband speeds will enable innovations in fields like healthcare, where the technology could enable new ways to process medical images and videos. powell's comments come as 5g , the fifth generation of cell networks technology, is setting the agenda at ces. powell tells me every evolution in the mobile networks needs to be met with new technology in broadband networks. the country critically needs both, powell said.

in any case, his activism is unusual. most mainstream news organizations frown on, if not outright ban, their journalists' participation in activities that could conflict with their reporting or cast them as central players in an issue. this usually means that contributing to or participating in a political cause is banned, lest it suggest that a reporter, or his news organization, is taking sides and thereby compromising their role as fair brokers of facts.
china's authoritarian leadership is all too aware of the need to pivot given its aging population and has set about trying to reorient the chinese economy to cater more to a domestic market after years of export-driven boom. in a decade's time, we may also know whether india's youth glut — more than half of its population is under 25 — has turned into either a demographic boon or a curse. the world's largest democracy is already struggling to support its vast population of young people with adequate education, health care and jobs.
now, more than ever, we must enter a new era of bipartisanship in washington, manchin said wednesday. with tight margins in the house and senate, democrats and republicans are faced with a decision to either work together to put the priorities of our nation before partisan politics or double down on the dysfunctional tribalism.

that's easy for jones to say. he has dak prescott and, for now, tony romo on the roster. jones chose not to speculate where manziel is concerned. last week, agent erik burkhardt took manziel back as a client after dumping him in february 2016. manziel had just been involved in an altercation with his then-girlfriend that resulted in a misdemeanor assault charge filed against him. that was the last straw in a string of poor decisions that resulted in manziel more often being shown partying in viral images and videos than working out, finally ending with being cut by the browns.

at a rally for the senate candidates last night in dalton, ga., trump opened by declaring that there's no way he lost the state: the president also falsely said he had won reelection 'in a landslide' and suggested that he expects vice president pence to make it so when he fulfills his constitutional duty to preside over wednesday's joint session … trump has complained that he does not think he will get credit if [david] perdue and loeffler win but will be blamed if they lose … trump became the first republican presidential candidate to lose georgia in three decades. … 'honestly, i think that he cannot handle being the sitting republican president that lost georgia,' said a gop official in frequent touch with the white house. … georgia's voting systems manager, gabriel sterling, refuted trump's voter fraud claims point by point at a news conference monday in atlanta. 'this is all easily, provably false, yet the president persists,' sterling said.

since 2006, bolivia has been run by socialists every bit as militant as venezuela's. but as economist omar zambrano has argued, the country has experienced a spectacular run of economic growth and poverty reduction with no hint of the chaos that has plagued venezuela. while inflation spirals toward the thousand-percent mark in venezuela, in bolivia it runs below 4 percent a year. shortages of basic consumption goods — rampant in caracas — are unheard of in la paz. and extreme poverty — now growing fast in venezuela — affects just 17 percent of bolivians now, down from 38 percent before the socialists took over 10 years ago, even as inequality shrinks dramatically. the richest 10 percent in bolivia used to earn 128 times more than the poorest 10 percent; today, they earn 38 times as much.

-- the trump administration and democratic leaders are still at an impasse over the border wall — signaling an indefinite continuation of the partial government shutdown that is now in its third week. robert costa, juliet eilperin, damian paletta and nick miroff report: as agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting white house budget director russell t. vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. it demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border. the administration has also signaled it would be willing to restore some version of an obama-era program that allowed children in guatemala, honduras and el salvador to apply for refugee resettlement in the united states ...

this is what my research shows
in our work on hybrid or what we call competitive authoritarian regimes, we show how democracy can be fundamentally compromised even without obvious civil liberties violations or electoral fraud. leaders can create an uneven playing field by using administrative powers to strengthen their party and systematically deny the opposition access to crucial resources, media or state institutions. these autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections — but engage in serious democratic abuse.

in the united states, the adoption of standard time was pushed by the progressive movement as a civilizing project, but it was also championed by railroad titans and business interests for whom coordinating economic activity across large distances was a major advantage. standard time met opposition from laborers who worried that their time of recreation would be curtailed, the detroit free press reported. others, worried about economic expediency superseding traditional local control, protested the substitution of railroad tycoon jay gould's time for god's time.
on monday, gov. gavin newsom (d) announced a statewide plan and a team of officials focused on bolstering california's oxygen supply. the army corps of engineers has also been called in and is sending crews to update oxygen-delivery infrastructure at several aging hospitals — five in downtown los angeles and two in san bernardino. separately, state emergency teams have been deployed to refill oxygen tanks at 42 medical support units across the state. the state is also leasing mobile oxygen systems to bolster supplies and looking to order several hundred oxygen concentrator units. the overarching goal, newsom said, is to reduce the stress placed on hospitals' existing oxygen systems so they can maintain adequate air pressure for patients.

trump tweeted this over the weekend, following the report:
the cdc announced a week and a half ago that it would add pilot coronavirus testing to its flu surveillance network in five cities, a step toward expanded testing of people with respiratory symptoms who didn't have other obvious risk factors. specimens that test negative for flu will be tested for coronavirus. but that expanded testing has been delayed because of an unspecified problem with one of the compounds used in the cdc test. about half of state labs got inconclusive results when using the compound, so the cdc said it would make a new version and redistribute it.

march 31: it's the end of the first fundraising quarter, the first traditional gut check and re-sorting of any presidential field. in the 2008 cycle, this was the moment when barack obama nearly matched hillary clinton's money haul, firming up the idea that he was a credible challenger. note that obama announced his numbers in the first week of april; campaigns are not required to turn everything in to the federal election commission until april 15, but increasingly, campaigns like to get a jump on the official filing and calculate their totals for the press.
we are not unique in this effort. in my own state of kentucky, my colleagues tiffany gruen, brison harvey, and kari patrick work tirelessly without additional pay to manage a website (www.kyedpolicy.org) and coordinate efforts in our state for teachers and legislators to work together on education policy. and then they go into the classroom and do amazing work with students. i could name example after example of teachers just like them; teachers who advocate for students inside and outside school walls, all the time.

in addition, by 2030, more than a billion people on the planet will be over the age of 65, according to a study funded by the national institutes of health. that's due to longer life expectancies and improving living standards around the world. but the maturing of the world population — not just in the west, but throughout asia and latin america, too — carries real policy conundrums.

but that doesn't mean romney will necessarily fail to act as a check on trump's power. even if romney chose political expediency before, he could feel this is his chance to effect change, now that he's actually got a washington job. it's worth entertaining the idea that romney truly believes his past trump criticisms and now wants to do something about them — or at least try. i do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault, romney writes. but i will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.

the debate about whether fema can pay to rebuild churches and other places of worship increased in the early 2000s. federal disaster assistance had been increasing as the agency grew, prompting debates about who got what. in 2002 the bush administration changed the practice regarding certain types of funding to religious groups — granting $550,000 to the seattle hebrew academy, a private school devastated by an earthquake.

the substance, which is imported from southeast asia and marketed as a supplement, has become increasingly popular among consumers looking for relief from pain, anxiety and depression as well as opioid-withdrawal symptoms. kratom, which is sometimes used for recreation, can produce a feeling of euphoria. advocates call it a safe way to deal with chronic pain and other conditions, and some researchers are exploring whether it helps people overcome addictions. but other researchers warn that the herb, taken in capsules or by drinking tea, is too risky to use.

this could lead to frequent elections and changes of government, as in the decade from 1996 to 2006, when no elected ecuadorian president served out a full term. it could also increase the temptation for presidents to dissolve parliament so that they can govern unilaterally during the undefined interim period before new elections can be held.
both sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue have proven loyal allies of the president. and the incumbents underlined the point this week as they defended the trump's push to overturn biden's victory in their state. perdue reacted to the news trump tried to bully georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger (r) into reversing the election outcome by condemning as disgusting the taping and releasing of their saturday conversation. and loeffler on monday declared she would join the dozen republican senators who have pledged to oppose certifying biden's electoral college win, repeating the pledge onstage with trump at a rally in dalton, ga.

the back-to-back timing of christmas and new year's eve could have catastrophic results because many people develop symptoms roughly five to seven days after infection and are most contagious during the 48 hours before those symptoms appear. that means someone who was exposed to the virus on christmas could have been contagious by the time they attended a new year's party or began traveling home. just how bad the situation gets in the united states may depend on how widely the virus's new variant — which scientists believe is more contagious, but not deadlier or vaccine-resistant — is circulating. the variant has been reported in five states including georgia, which reported its first case [on] tuesday. … new daily deaths and cases have increased by more than 20 percent over the past week, to a total of more than 355,000 fatalities and 21 million infections. but experts say the toll on hospitals paints a clearer picture of the pandemic because of complications in reporting test results during the holidays.

(applause) and we can make this progress at the national level. a central part of my agenda, for example, is to challenge and change title 1, to make sure we close the achievement gap, to make sure that children are not forgotten and simply shuffled through the system. under my vision, all students must be measured. we must test to know. and low-performing schools, those schools that won't teach and won't change, will have three years to produce results, three years to meet standards, three years to make sure the very faces of our future are not mired in mediocrity. and if they're able to do so, the resources must go to the parents so that parents can make a different choice. you see, no child--no child should be left behind in america. (applause) see every child can learn. every child can learn. and every child in this country deserves to grow in knowledge and character and ideals. nothing in my view is more important to our prosperity and goodness than cultivated minds and courageous hearts. as w.e.b. du bois said a century ago, either the united states will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the united states. education is the essential beginning, but we've got to go further.

during weekend visits to archipelago or cotton and reed — two places where i had never made a reservation in my life — i repeatedly heard people walk up to the host, ask for a table, and be told none were available. in the summer, you might just wander off to see if a different restaurant in the neighborhood has space. in fall or winter, instead of supporting a struggling business, you might just go home rather than face getting rejected at the next bar, too. visits to places that don't take reservations were just as awkward: attempts to visit wunder garten or dacha were aborted because we showed up to find long lines outside that didn't appear to be socially distanced.

on monday, the trump administration decided to hold an as-yet-unscheduled principals committee meeting on what do regarding $125 million of u.s. aid to the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east (unrwa) that was scheduled to be delivered jan. 1 but is now on hold. the meeting will include several cabinet members, but all eyes will be on haley, who has been leading the drive to cut the funding.

no cases have been confirmed so far in any of africa's 54 countries, but the risk of an outbreak is high, world health organization leaders say. africa is home to 1.2 billion people, including an estimated 1 million chinese nationals, who tend to work in business, construction, oil and mining — a testament to beijing's increasingly tight relationship with senegal, nigeria, ethiopia and beyond.

with assad's survival now all but guaranteed, these voices — many hosting syrian refugees that they want to return — will grow louder. as britain departs the e.u. and germany hosts 600,000 syrians, france may find itself unable to prevent a shift in european policy. e.u. policy is slow-moving and will still seek to attach conditions to the gradual lifting of any sanctions or provision of aid. while it may eventually split with washington on syria, assad will have to wait some time yet.

the white house has advanced several policies through executive orders rather than legislation, starting with an expanded version of the bush-era mexico city policy, which bars u.s. funding to public health organizations that promote abortion overseas and which trump reinstated upon taking office. on thursday, the day before the march, trump announced another policy that pleased antiabortion activists — a new office meant to protect the rights of medical professionals who don't want to participate in abortions because of their religious beliefs.

this becomes something new from trumpian illiberalism and libertarian indifference to the public good:
for one thing, biden surely would score high on the have a beer with the guy electability test. biden doesn't even drink beer, or any alcohol, but he's still able to inspire a sense of collegial good feeling. i saw as much at the november 2006 return day ceremony, a post-election tradition in sussex county, del., when politicians from both sides gather and literally bury a hatchet to symbolize goodwill. lots of beer is consumed on return day, but one of the most convivial participants i saw was the teetotal biden. washington could use a few more old-school politicians who understand that spirit of bipartisanship.
still, u.s. law grants broad powers to the commander in chief, particularly if the president finds reason to declare a state of emergency, as trump did on the southern border to divert pentagon funding to his border wall project. and trump retains command of the d.c. guard, because the district is not a state, as well as the power to relieve senior officials at will.

but having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the federalist society's expanding sway. for one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. when trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a supreme court justice. leonard leo, executive vice president of the federalist society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with trump's future white house counsel, don mcgahn (also a society member), and the conservative heritage foundation. the list was expanded twice to include gorsuch, kavanaugh and others. leo took a leave from his job at the federalist society to advise the white house on the confirmation process for gorsuch and kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the george w. bush white house in putting roberts and alito on the court.

it's rush hour on a november evening in washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. the federalist society has taken over the main hall of union station for its annual black-tie gala. the stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of james madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.

second, the next administration should increase refugee numbers from the countries impacted by the bans. the number of refugee admissions has decreased dramatically after the initial admission of more than 207,000 refugees in 1980, when the refugee act was passed. for 2020, president trump set the number at just 18,000, having already severely restricted refugee resettlement from nearly a dozen muslim-majority nations through his so-called refugee ban. meanwhile, syrians who have suffered from a nearly decade-long civil war continue to be barred indefinitely, and yemenis who have witnessed a near-total health-care and economic collapse are denied refuge. biden's intent to increase refugee admissions to 125,000 is welcome, but to truly heal the wounds from the incalculable harm inflicted by the bans, including trump's refugee ban, the incoming administration must prioritize admissions from impacted countries. doing so will help restore the united states' promise as a haven; failing to do so risks repeating the tragic mistakes of our past.
for decades, progressives have tried to abolish the electoral college in favor of a direct democracy approach; under their plan, votes would be cast in a national election, bypassing electors and the states. they have pushed populist initiatives, most notably the national popular vote interstate compact, to do away with the electoral college without even having to go through the inconvenience of a constitutional amendment. this interstate compact directs participating states to cast their electoral votes for the presidential candidate with the highest number of votes nationwide — regardless of the choice of the voters in their own states.

but the real indication that the mortar is dissolving in this building will not come from media reports. it will come from a subtle change in the on-field habits that have been the patriots' signatures for years, the lockstep precision and attention to detail and their remarkably disciplined focus, the ability to shut out everything else and to control the day, as special teams captain matthew slater put it.

we had a situation where it was just out of control because of [rannazzisi], marino said. his only mission was to get big fines. he didn't want to [do] anything but put another notch in his belt.
as the 2016 election campaign heated up, leo became president of three new nonprofits whose tax filings and incorporation records illustrate how his network sometimes operates. the groups — called bh fund, the freedom and opportunity fund and america engaged — were formed by an employee at holtzman vogel josefiak torchinsky, a warrenton, va., law firm with deep ties to the conservative movement. the nonprofits reported having no employees and no websites. they had virtually no public presence. leo's role as president of all three groups was not disclosed for nearly three years because of lags in how nonprofit groups report their annual operations to the irs.

shortly after barack obama took office in 2009, blackrock executives began meeting with mid-level and senior white house economics officials, senior adviser valerie jarrett, chief of staff rahm emanuel and, later, chief of staff william daley, according to white house visitor logs. in 2014, fink met three times with jeff zients, then the director of president obama's national economic council and now slated to take on the role of coronavirus czar in the biden administration.
at the federalist society, leo took a leading role in the conservative legal movement, part of a burgeoning effort to counter the influence of the 1960s and liberals on education, law and politics.
this remains a mystery. trump has a habit of suggesting he's able to pull off a quick deal with foreign leaders because no one previously had made the right demands. so we take this tale with a large grain of salt; the white house did not respond to a query.
the drawdown of international troops is probably central to the taliban's growing openness toward education. the taliban has historically perceived education as an extension of the government and international forces. with the international troop presence now largely reduced, the taliban may feel less threatened by foreign-funded activities like the opening of schools.
nelson has been as outspoken in his opposition to atlantic and gulf drilling near florida as scott has been silent. the trump administration's acquiescence to scott's request was criticized by some as politics, saying it allowed the governor to position himself as a friend of the environment, even as local government officials, planners and environmentalists adamantly say he has never been.

but when servers who are struggling to make ends meet are seeing both a decline in tips and a rise in sexual harassment, should we really be leaving an employee's rent money in the hands of people who ask servers to remove their masks before deciding to add or subtract a few bucks? of course not.

dodd's path from who? to serious contender will be guided by a stable of political advisers that represent a mix of old and new. some -- like pollster stan greenberg and rep. rosa delauro (conn.) -- have been with dodd for decades, while others -- jim jordan and amos hochstein -- are newcomers who were previously committed to ex-virginia gov. mark warner.
romney said he couldn't let concerns over breaking with his party guide his vote, which he cast as one of conscience and rooted in his religious beliefs.
in georgia, they worship god. in small, red-brick buildings next to cotton fields. in strip malls next to bargain outlets. in large multimillion-dollar complexes with expansive parking lots, they praise his name. but georgians do not always worship together. and they do not always receive god's message in the same way. centuries of racial and social segregation mean that while black and white may be a part of the same body of christ, they aren't necessarily in communion with each other.
at a campaign rally, trump says it might be a good thing to get along with russia.
legitimizing taliban sends the wrong signal to isis and al-qaeda terrorists, and to america's enemies generally, bolton wrote in a tweet.

according to reeves, some ballou students have to drop off and pick up siblings at their schools. others leave school early to commute to afternoon jobs, while others care for ailing parents and grandparents. the school experienced a high turnover of teachers last year, and administrators struggled to get students to classes taught by substitute teachers.
one company was held liable in a crash involving an employee making work-related cold calls while driving to a private event on a saturday night. in a 2010 case in texas cited by the council, a jury awarded a $21 million verdict against a company whose employee was using a hands-free device to talk on a mobile device when she hit another vehicle.
unemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. two important considerations: some big state trust funds (new york, california and texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.
but that $21 trillion estimate isn't necessarily waste; it's just sloppily accounted for, according to that study. it's also not just money the pentagon spends; it includes money coming into the pentagon. and that $32 trillion price tag is an estimate for the first 10 years of medicare-for-all, while the pentagon number accounts for a 17-year period. ocasio-cortez's numbers weren't just wrong on the margins; her conclusion made no logical sense in light of the actual facts. what's more, this isn't the only claim she's made that has been debunked; the post's team documented five false claims she made during an august media blitz following her primary upset of rep. joseph crowley (d-n.y.).
officials said they had questions about the studies' expense to taxpayers. one, stopped in august, was looking at whether residents near surface coal mining sites in appalachia face higher health risks than other americans. the second, suspended last month, was aimed at updating and enhancing the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement's oil and gas inspection program.
the delays cost months, sometimes years.
these measures attempt to introduce more competition among drugmakers by leveling the playing field — an approach some in thetrump administration (including health and human services secretary alex azar and food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb) favor even as they remain suspicious of approaches that smack of government price-fixing. as for democrats, they'd like the government to play a much more robust role in the prescription drug pricing business, but many feel they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
the statement made the point that journalists decide who covers the president, and how they do so. though it was a touch diplomatic for some:
other diplomats argued that trying to deal with the taliban was a waste of time.
i've made it clear on several occasions, and let me say it again: the senate will not take up any proposal that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature. let's not waste the time, mcconnell said. let's not get off on the wrong foot, with house democrats using their new platform to produce political statements rather than serious solutions.
the hotel companies and amusement parks that blackstone has owned (hilton, la quinta, motel 6, six flags, busch gardens) have benefited from a federal minimum wage that hasn't budged in more than a decade, and labor laws that now make it almost impossible for workers to vote in a union at any company that is determined to stop them.

co-pastoring is a growing trend in u.s. houses of worship, with many churches and couples finding that sharing the often-emotionally heavy workload can benefit both the clergy and the congregants.
we thank the trump administration for righting this longtime wrong and treating disaster-damaged churches, synagogues and other houses of worship fairly — on the same terms as other nonprofits such as museums, community centers and libraries stricken by natural disaster, said nathan diament, executive director for public policy at the orthodox union, a major u.s. orthodox jewish organization.
the rule reflects the trump administration's dogged push to lock in as many policies as possible before president-elect joe biden takes office on jan. 20. although the new administration will probably seek to overturn it, such an effort will take months, if not longer. the epa administrator is allowed to waive the requirement on a case-by-case basis, but it is possible that outside groups could challenge those waivers in court.

insurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. the bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. it also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.

jerome said he found that statement a bit incredulous, considering that he told the agency something was up with the data months earlier. in a letter to the department reviewed by the washington post, the college president questions whether the scorecard data are accurate, citing research to the contrary from the brookings institution. he also points out large variations in the three-, five- and seven-year repayment rates listed on the scorecard. instead of rates improving each year as borrowers' earnings increase, they went down and then back up, he wrote.

this is probably the most personal entry on the list, but as a (formerly) regular traveler to the united kingdom, i've always enjoyed buying rounds in the pub instead of running up a tab. for those unfamiliar with the concept: you order drinks for the members of your group, and you pay for them on the spot. when glasses are close to empty, another member of the group gets and pays for drinks. repeat. no waiting until the end of the night to split a check five ways or arguing with the itemizer who says but you had more drinks than me. (dealing with people who duck out on rounds is a discussion for another time.)

progressive lawmakers such as warren (d) and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) have long been critical of the relationship between members of congress and the business interests who lobby them. last year, a study published in the american political science review painted a stark picture of how corporations have skewed congress's perception of what the american public wants.

nor is this program a departure from what's proposed by much of the rest of the e.u. also germany, generally seen as liberal on immigration, has aimed at substantially reducing immigration to europe. the austria-driven closure of the balkan route and german chancellor angela merkel's e.u.-turkey agreement have worked together for this common end. thus, the new austrian government will likely be roughly in sync with other e.u. governments on immigration to europe. this fact should not be overshadowed by kurz's recent rejection of the e.u. quota system for distributing asylum seekers — a policy that has been a political nonstarter anyway.

but hawley's populist view is also fatally flawed. working-class voters have a strong sense of desert and need that underlies their views on government action. they oppose aid for people who don't deserve or need help, whether they are people who prefer to take government aid without working or the rich who get tax write-offs and preferential treatment to fund their comfortable lifestyles. giving $2,000 checks without regard to how covid-19 has affected an individual means nonworking poor and hard-working rich alike will get checks they neither deserve nor need. analysis of the house-passed bill that would provide the $2,000 checks shows that nearly one-third of the aid would go to taxpayers making more than $100,000 a year, and nearly 9 percent would go to people making between $200,000 and $500,000. splashing cash on well-to-do people is not the way to win working-class votes.
in so doing, the u.s.-hagelin partnership had evolved from denial to active measures. no longer was crypto merely restricting sales of its best equipment but actively selling devices that were engineered to betray their buyers.

the pope's sluggish, inadequate and compromised stance in the face of this outrage is the subject of a new book, lust, by a respected italian journalist, emiliano fittipaldi. the book, published last week, is an indictment not just of a papal policy that has failed to live up to its ringing promises about zero tolerance for clerical sexual abuse, but of francis's papacy.

cooper: one of the criticisms of you is that-- that your math is fuzzy. the washington post recently awarded you four pinocchios -- ocasio-cortez: oh my goodness -- cooper: -- for misstating some statistics about pentagon spending? ocasio-cortez: if people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, i would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. i think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right. cooper: but being factually correct is important-- ocasio-cortez: it's absolutely important. and whenever i make a mistake. i say, okay, this was clumsy, and then i restate what my point was. but it's -- it's not the same thing as -- as the president lying about immigrants. it's not the same thing at all.

it's of course reasonable for an administration to communicate with people in the business sector, he said, but having these conversations stewarded by so many people who've been eating off of the finance sector in recent years, or who helped run an obama administration that never meaningfully confronted the power of finance — and who will now run regulatory and broader macroeconomic policy — is concerning.

(applause) i'm reminded--i'm reminded--i'm reminded of what the great jackie robinson once said when president kennedy did something that upset him. jackie robinson said that he was sure the president was a fine man, but he reserved the right to change his opinion. and for those of you who support me--i see a couple here... (applause) maybe more than a couple. (applause) i hope you won't change your opinion. (laughter) and for those of you who don't, i hope at least you take jackie's position as your own and give me a chance to tell you what's on my heart.

to create communities of promise, we must help people build the confidence and faith to achieve their own dreams. we must put government squarely on the side of opportunity. there's a higher and older tradition in my party. lincoln argued that every poor man should have a chance. he defended a clear path for all. he financed colleges and welcomed immigrants, promoted railroads and economic development. through the homestead act, he gave countless americans a piece of land for a start in a life. i propose a new prosperity initiative that reflects the spirit of lincoln's reforms, a plan to remove obstacles on the road to the middle class. you see, instead of helping people cope with their need, we will help them move beyond it. and here's some of the ideas of the new prosperity initiative--just some of the thoughts. we must provide a family health credit that covers 90 percent of the cost of basic health policy for low-income families. we must make it possible for more people to become homeowners in this great land, to own a part of the american dream. we would allow low-income families to use up to a year's worth of section 8 rental payments to make a down-payment on their own home, then use five years of those payments to help with the mortgage. (applause) we'll start an american dream down-payment fund, matching individual savings to the down-payment for a home. behind these last two proposals is a simple belief: i believe in private property.

hawley and cruz, both likely harboring presidential ambitions, blew it. they apparently figured they would raise a fuss, and that the others would go along. did they not anticipate that some of their colleagues would rediscover their oaths of office — or at least be bright enough to surmise that sedition could block the path to higher office? there is something fitting that two supremely ambitious men may have doomed their own quest for the presidency through an act of unbridled cynicism and contempt for democracy.

blackrock has a lot at stake. janet l. yellen, biden's nominee to run the treasury department, has been sharply critical of moves by the trump administration to ease oversight of companies such as blackrock. if yellen tightens restrictions, the company could find itself in a much different regulatory environment, potentially forcing it to set aside more reserves and hire more compliance officials.

they are not. the fringe has grown only more robust over the past four years, encouraged by trump. he's leveraged sycophantic entities such as one america news and newsmax in an effort to pressure fox news to move further toward the right, an effort that has borne some fruit. he's refused to clamp down on bizarre conspiracy theories such as qanon, even at times encouraging them. an expert who spoke with the post in 2017 noted that trump's politics are rooted in baseless conspiracy theories, something reinforced by his approach to communications as president. his counternarrative to russia's interference in the 2016 election? a broad, baseless claim centered on the fbi. his rationalization for losing the election? a conspiracy among his opponents and state officials to prevent a win.

but it's going to become increasingly difficult for the white house to defend using key parts of the federal government as a bargaining chip to negotiate complex immigration policy that has evaded washington for years. trump's visit to the border will be a hail mary as he tries to convince the american public that holding out for a border wall is worth holding the federal government hostage.

ecuadorians will also cast national assembly votes this sunday, using the rare free list electoral system, which is somewhat like an extreme version of open lists. some countries elect their parliaments or congresses using an open list, which lets voters choose among candidates on the list. others use a closed electoral list, where voters vote for the party itself, rather than individual candidates.

south dakota's legislature is often used as a testing ground for conservative bills, because republicans hold a supermajority in the statehouse and there's a low cost for lobbying in the state. it was one of the first states to pass a law restricting transgender students' bathroom use. that 2016 law was ultimately vetoed by the governor, but it helped build momentum for a flurry of bathroom bills across the country.

instead, the policy debate has been overshadowed by an engineering project imbued with partisan emotion, with trump fighting for billions of dollars in taxpayer funding and threatening to invoke emergency powers to build a wall without congressional approval. after failing to reach a deal with democratic leaders, trump seesawed friday between characterizing the current border crisis as a dangerous horrible disaster and warning that the shutdown could stretch for months or years.

it's important to understand the distributional consequences of a $1.6 trillion debt jubilee before a decision is made in part because erasing college debt won't reduce the average debt of americans. rather, it will transfer private liabilities to the general public by increasing the federal debt. the long-run consequence will be an increase in taxes or a decrease in public spending. the redistributional effects will be immediate.
i'm very optimistic that the long overdue effort to rein in the price gouging from phrma is underway, rep. peter welch (d-vt.) who is seen as a leader on the issue, told me on friday.
because every dollar over the $500,000 mark for a single filer is taxed at 37 percent, and because as more income is added, that first $500,000 makes up a smaller percentage of the total, the amount that's paid in taxes for the wealthiest americans ends up being at about 37 percent of income. (math nerds: please write this in the form of a limit.) there are tons of caveats and loopholes, as anyone who has ever filled out a tax return can attest, but we're making a point broadly about how the system works, so these figures will suffice.
i am glad trump brought up the end of the soviet union, however. the u.s.s.r. didn't magically change its name; the west won the cold war (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). putin views the fall of the soviet union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing russia as a great power, which trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing syria to russia and its ally iran.

we're pretty disappointed that the gop senate and house have still failed to fully defund planned parenthood — that was and continues to be our no. 1 legislative priority. this is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. i think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'we've elected them. they'll do what they say.' no, they're not doing what they said. you need to push them.
facebook began its investigation of news for democracy in december, after the post first reported some details about the alabama campaign, known as project birmingham. facebook suspended at least one researcher involved, jonathon morgan, for violating its policies prohibiting coordinated inauthentic activity. that included the creation of a fake facebook page that offered an endorsement of a write-in republican candidate in the state's 2017 special election for senate.

the president's very first words of the new year were an endorsement of a pro-trump book by former white house aide sebastian gorka. the former breitbart writer, a frequent television defender of the president, quit or was fired in 2017 partly in protest that trump's first major speech about the u.s. military strategy in afghanistan made no mention of what he called radical islam.

there is no simple way to know whether the early implementation of a more developed tips collection program would have slowed or limited the deterioration of iraq's security. some scholars argue that other factors made insurgency inevitable, including the limited number of u.s. troops deployed and the de-baathification policy and its decision to disband iraq's military.

it might have seemed like a harbinger of what's to come: this democratic primary contest is, after all, a historic race for american jews. the other man in the two-man race for the nomination is sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), an avowed democratic socialist and another jew, who looks like the front-runner after coasting through the first three contests, itself a historic feat for a jewish candidate. the faceoff between the jewish billionaire and the jewish socialist is the most jewish political moment in american history, and predictions have abounded that a wave of hatred is about to hit as the two gain steam, evoking mythological anti-semitic creatures to rapacious anti-semites: the elder of zion and the judeo-bolshevik in a race for control of america! the daily stormer headlines write themselves.

trump's willingness — eagerness, even — to focus on the financial bottom line and then take extreme measures to win, or rather, to be perceived as someone willing to go to extremes, is nothing new. it's how he built his career, positioning himself as a provocateur who would destroy historic landmarks after promising not to do so or threaten to move homeless people into a high-end apartment building to pressure tenants to leave — all in service of higher profits and better deals.

i believe in private property so strongly i want everybody to have some. (applause) education helps the young. empowerment lifts the able. but there are those who need much more: children without role models; young people captured by gangs, addiction or despair. government can spend money, but it cannot put hope in someone's heart or a sense of purpose in someone's life. this is done by caring communities, by churches and charities that serve their neighbors because they love their god. every day they prove that our worst problems are not hopeless or endless. every day they perform miracles of renewal. what we need is a new attitude that welcomes the transforming power of faith. in the words of a writer who visited the mount haven (ph) section of bronx, ``the beautiful old stone church is a gentle sanctuary from the terror of the streets outside.'' in city after city, for the suffering and hurting, the most powerful passageway is the door of the house of god. we're going to extend the role and reach of charities and churches and synagogues and mosques, mentors and community healers in our society. as president, i will rally the armies of compassion in neighborhoods all across america. i'll lift the regulations that hamper private and faith-based programs. i'll involve them in after-school programs and maternity group homes, drug treatment programs and prison ministries. and i have laid out specific incentives to encourage an outpouring of giving in america.

good guys don't let children die because they lack the fortitude to do the right thing (usually the hard thing to do), specifically regarding sensible gun safety. good guys don't make laws that favor guns over people. good guys don't ignore that the modern weapon systems we glibly characterize generally as guns continue mowing down scores of innocents and do nothing about it. good guys don't retreat when confronted by a formidable lobby that values gun rights beyond what our founding fathers conceived. good guys don't settle on allowing their children to be traumatized by frightening lockdowns.

trump, meanwhile, was somewhat restrained, following counsel from his aides to shrug off romney's salvo.
the rift has not just hurt qatar. the boycotting states, particularly the uae, lost tourists and investors from qatar and the dispute shook confidence in regional business hub dubai, which many companies use as a base for their gulf and wider middle east operations. in the u.k., qatari broadcaster bein even tried to block a consortium that included saudi arabia's public investment fund from buying soccer club newcastle united; the sovereign wealth fund ultimately abandoned the bid. more widely, the u.s. voiced concern that the row had complicated security cooperation in a region that hosts major u.s. bases and is a significant exporter and route for global oil supplies. washington also sees unity among persian gulf states as essential to combating the influence of its foe iran, which u.s. officials view as having benefited from the divisions.

govtrack.us has data on the number of new laws enacted in each congress since 1973. the peak over that period came in the 95th congress, which took office in 1977 with democratic president jimmy carter, a democratic majority in the house and a democratic majority in the senate that topped 60 votes. evidence, it would seem, for the utility of unified government. but, then, only slightly less legislation was passed in the four years prior.

according to the national institutes of health, nearly 1 in 3 people ages 13 to 18 experience an anxiety disorder, and a study published in april 2018 in the journal of development and behavioral pediatrics found that anxiety diagnoses in children ages 6 to 17 increased 20 percent between 2007 and 2012. there's no single cause: a nonstop barrage of social media, a heightened political climate and the threat of school shootings are all stressors. and that's on top of being a teenager, with all the tumult that entails.

president trump announced a sweeping ban on transgender people's military service via twitter in july 2017, citing what he viewed as the tremendous medical costs and disruption. the administration's order reversed president barack obama's policy of allowing transgender men and women to serve openly and receive funding for sex-reassignment surgery.
up until now, general election trial heats have shown both sanders and biden beating trump pretty much every time. but we should never assume that what people think of the eventual nominee now tells us much about what they'll think of him in october, once the full power of trump's disinformation machine is aimed at him, not to mention a news media that is likely to repeat the but her emails debacle of 2016.
interested in the sexual lives of older adults, we studied life in assisted living facilities and found that these institutions' rules and practices make it difficult for seniors to develop romantic relationships. fixing that will require changes in how we view seniors' sexual desires and how these facilities are run.
turkey has emerged as a potential winner. meanwhile, the prospect of a pullout has deeply alarmed the syrian kurdish forces allied with the united states. turkey considers them terrorists and has vowed to drive them out of northeastern syria. bolton said sunday that an agreement would be reached to keep the kurds out of jeopardy, but kurdish officials have told reporters that they are seeking a deal with president bashar al-assad's government just in case.

the reasons for clinton's loss are still debated two years after the election. but even as rep. nancy pelosi (d-calif.) was elected house speaker on wednesday, the women looking at white house campaigns continue to shoulder gendered criticism and demands not placed on their male counterparts: to be strong but not too tough; to be assertive without being pushy, lest voters turn away for reasons that they may not acknowledge are sexist but that researchers say are.
this is the greatest strength of difficult women: the collection makes us look at things we'd rather avoid. if bad feminist, gay's 2014 essay collection, was a comfort, encouraging women to ease up on themselves when judging their own enthusiasm and inconsistencies, difficult women is a challenge, at times as sharp and as dirty as that fingernail slicing through layers of skin and fat.
just about every statement by trump here is wrong. the soviets invaded afghanistan in 1979 to prop up a communist government that had seized power before it was toppled by political unrest; there were no terrorists going into russia. (perhaps the president is thinking of chechnya?) the united states secretly funded afghan insurgents who helped make the war a quagmire for the soviets — what the state department says became the longest and largest [covert action] in u.s. history to that point. the afghan war might have been a contributing factor to the soviet union's collapse but it was certainly not the only factor. the biggest factor likely was a collapse in oil prices after saudi arabia altered its oil policy in 1985, which led to massive borrowing by the government and then an effective bankruptcy of the country.

as trump and democrats scrap over the wall, both sides have all the power they need to block the other. democrats can use their house majority — or a senate filibuster — to stall any legislation that includes additional money for a wall. trump can veto any bill that doesn't, and senate republicans have said they won't advance any legislation that lacks the president's blessing.
but the produce-or-else testing culture that she fostered — tying portions of some evaluations to growth in scores and securing commitments from principals to hit numerical targets — created a climate of fear, in the view of many school employees. it also coincided with evidence of cheating on annual city tests.

d.c. mayor muriel e. bowser (d) was determined to reopen schools this fall. but changing plans and communication shortcomings on the part of the city, and shifting, hard-line demands on the part of the union, kept schools closed for months, squandering the chance to return the most vulnerable students to the classroom while infection rates were low, city officials, union leaders, educators and activists told the post.

it has become a common argument on the left when lamenting trump that had sanders been the democratic nominee over hillary clinton, he would have attracted enough support to beat trump. the argument is that liberals who did not back clinton would have voted for sanders, along with some of the white working-class voters and men who ultimately chose trump.
parties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. as a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.

indeed, the comprehensive plan is itself a problem: it says everything and thus nothing. it says the district should be more inclusive, needs more housing and should pursue infill development, especially near metro stations. but it also says neighborhoods should be protected against change, with maps that don't reflect the policy priorities in the rest of the plan. it bobs and weaves and hedges in an effort to please everyone so that anyone can find arguments to support or oppose any project in its pages.
throughout the 1980s, the list of crypto's leading clients read like a catalogue of global trouble spots. in 1981, saudi arabia was crypto's biggest customer, followed by iran, italy, indonesia, iraq, libya, jordan and south korea.

part of the shift can be traced to the contentious national conversation about how law enforcement treats communities of color — from the trump administration's policy of deporting immigrants without criminal records to high-profile police beatings and killings of african americans. in north carolina, those issues were at the core of several urban sheriffs' races.

making idr plans more generous could also lead to more forgiveness for low earners. we calculate what would happen if the idr threshold were increased from 150 percent to 300 percent of the poverty line. (in other words, no repayment until someone made three times poverty wages.) such a policy would benefit the bottom third of borrowers more than would blanket forgiveness of $50,000 in debt, we found. yet, the overall cost to taxpayers would be nearly three times smaller because it would barely reduce the payment of high earners.

with the afghan security forces lagging in quantity and quality, the u.s. military has been unable to extricate itself from the faraway conflict. although the number of u.s. troops in afghanistan has dwindled from 100,000 eight years ago to 13,000 today, the trump administration has had to escalate the war from the skies to prevent the taliban from taking over.
the white house faces mounting pressure from lawmakers and national security officials to blame russia for election interference. but the intelligence community has still not reached consensus on putin's role and intentions.
how much all of that affected the outcome in the runoffs is anyone's guess, but few republicans thought he was anything but harmful. trump's insistence that the results of presidential election be reversed, his call for republicans to raise objections to the electoral college votes during wednesday's joint session of congress and his pressure campaign against vice president pence to do what is not possible have split his party at the worst possible moment. that might have influenced enough republican voters in georgia to stay home, helping democrats' cause.

molina argued the requirement could result in confusion and more gaming of the system — he questioned how it would even work logistically, with insurance companies researching whether people had been continuously covered or issuing some certificate that people had coverage ending at a certain date. and, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.

immigration policy presents another opening. the ugliness of the trump administration's immigration policies might appeal to some parts of the gop, but the president appears to be losing some republicans on the issue. between december 2018 and july 2019, for example, republican support for accepting refugees from central america climbed 10 points, to 24 percent, according to gallup. trump's anti-immigrant message works with his base but cuts against overall trends: since 1999, gallup says, americans' support for keeping the immigration level the same or increasing it has climbed from 51 percent to 64 percent, with the biggest jump — from 10 percent to 27 percent — in support for raising the immigration numbers.

in addition to the potential harm to businesses, the federal shutdown will leave hundreds of thousands of federal employees with a lot of spare time and no paychecks. federal rules do not allow non-essential individuals to work for the government without pay, so many federal workers will be furloughed for the duration of a shutdown. just look at the numbers: the federal government is responsible for 367.900 civilian jobs in the washington area with a weekly payroll of $777 million, along with another 64,500 military jobs accounting for $122 million in weekly payroll and benefits.
romney is asked about trump's comments.
trump's strategy wasn't complicated. he watched fox news and read sites such as breitbart and reiterated the questions and concerns he saw there. when violence in central america led to a surge of young immigrants at the border with mexico, trump echoed conservative media in seizing on immigration as an issue. when several people infected with ebola traveled to the united states shortly before the 2014 midterm elections, trump, like fox news and breitbart, obsessed over it.
we all need to learn more about what we don't know or understand. i do have friends who are trans as well as friends who have trans children, duba said. no one would voluntarily choose to go through this pain and discrimination. unfortunately, i live in a state where religion and fear of the unknown drive decisions.
but after gov. greg abbott (r) and state health commissioner john hellerstedt pressed for vaccine providers to move more quickly, some clinics saw lines form outside. the commissioner had said in a statement there was no need to ensure that everyone in the first priority group — health-care workers and staff and residents of long-term care facilities — was vaccinated before moving onto the next, which in texas includes senior citizens and those with underlying conditions.

roberts is a conservative, of course, but one who has been wary of advancing the court's movement on gun control and abortion too far and too fast. on these and other issues, barrett might not be so reluctant.

manhattan's district attorney, cyrus r. vance jr., has signaled that his 16-count indictment is intended to ensure manafort is held accountable for his crimes regardless of the presidential pardon he received late last month, shayna jacobs reports. vance brought his case against manafort in march 2019. new york supreme court justice maxwell wiley dismissed it later that year, saying the charges too closely overlapped with the federal conviction. the dismissal was upheld in october by a state appeals court, a decision vance now hopes the new york court of appeals will agree to review. manafort's lawyer, todd blanche, wrote in monday's letter to new york's top judge that the state court charges dismissed more than a year ago 'allege the exact same fraud, causing the exact same harm.'
i call on my former republican colleagues to return to the business of governing. that's why they were elected. our country is facing issues that demand solutions and cooperation, not more division, rhetoric and condescension. we must unite to address the immediate challenge of responding to covid-19 and managing its long-term impact, confront our exploding debt, compete with russia and china, strengthen our economy and build for the future. we cannot solve any of these challenges if we are bickering among ourselves, battling unfounded conspiracy theories and allowing bitter partisan rancor to dominate sensible policy progress.
the seating of new pennsylvania legislators turned into a bitter partisan spectacle tuesday, as republicans in the state senate blocked a democratic lawmaker from taking his oath of office and removed the democratic lieutenant governor from his role overseeing the proceedings, hannah knowles reports. republicans say they will not seat sen.-elect jim brewster as a legal challenge to his victory is pending, although his win has been certified and the pennsylvania supreme court recently sided with him in a dispute over how to count votes in a close race. democrats decried the move as an overreach and an echo of republican attempts to overturn the result of the presidential election. in an interview, lt. gov. john fetterman (d) accused republicans of 'raw partisanship,' drawing a 'straight line' between their actions and broader gop resistance to certifying the election of biden. … brewster edged out his republican opponent nicole ziccarelli by 69 votes, and ziccarelli is urging a federal court to discount about 300 mail ballots from allegheny county without handwritten dates on their envelopes.

under federal law and dea policy, pharmaceutical companies such as mallinckrodt are required to know their customers and monitor the pattern, frequency and amounts of drug orders. when suspicious orders occur, companies must immediately notify the agency or risk losing their dea licenses to sell or manufacture controlled substances, as well as face civil and criminal penalties.
there are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life, romney says, after trump hands it off to him. this is one of them. he goes on to say that being in trump's hotel and getting his endorsement is a delight.

some u.s. officials were furious and said it was time for a reckoning, while others argued it was more important to mollify karzai and retain his support for the war. complicating matters further was a new york times report that karzai's aide had been on the cia's payroll for years.
investigations into why someone left their last job are taking much longer during the pandemic. in november 2019, 90 percent were resolved within a month. now only 40 percent are done in a month. in georgia, 75 percent of cases like clark's are taking more than 10 weeks to resolve, labor department data shows.

this precedent, legal experts and associates of those arrested wednesday say, raises concern that they would not be granted bail if charged under the security law — leaving dozens in detention until formal hearings begin. of the more than 50 arrested, many were defeated in the primary and have continued their work in the community and civil society, including jeffrey andrews, hong kong's first ethnic minority candidate to run in legislative elections and a longtime advocate of minority and refugee rights.
but this is the slipperiest of slopes — the kind of attitude you can use to justify pretty much anything to yourself. and it also just so happens to be the underlying ethos of the entire trump presidency.

wonder woman 1984's critical reception has whipped from early praise to precipitous decline as fast as diana prince (gal gadot) can snap her lasso of truth. but while it's a pretty bad dc comics movie — spoken as someone who, in general, really likes dc comics movies — it is something rarer: a pretty solid washington, d.c. movie. given hollywood's tendency to treat our nation's capital as geographically and culturally indistinct and weirdly underpopulated, it's nice to see ww84 break with that trend and show the world just how beautiful and eccentric the district and its residents can be.
in inflation-adjusted terms, federal supply-side anti-drug spending ballooned from $2.2 billion in 1981 to $15.3 billion in 2012. you can disregard that crater in 2002 — a temporary change to the drug spending calculation was made that year, resulting in a number of significant spending lines removed from it.

the right is looking at barrett's judicial record and daring to dream big again. as a judge on the u.s. court of appeals for the 7th circuit, barrett abided by the court's precedents on restricting protesters from the doors of abortion clinics and health centers. but she and fellow judges criticized the jurisprudence as incoherent. conservative lawyers are hoping that a case from pittsburgh will allow barrett and like-minded colleagues to ease or eliminate the limitations.

one tragedy is that trump, notwithstanding his irksome personality, could have been a great president had he been able to control his temper and his tongue. like lear, he suffers from intermittent explosive disorder, overreacting to all kinds of unimportant matters. trump's stream-of-consciousness twitter storms in response to any perceived slight were childish tantrums, indicating a lack of emotional maturity that put terror in the hearts of normal adults.

the army and police have suffered so many casualties that the afghan government keeps the exact numbers a secret to avoid destroying morale. estimates are that more than 60,000 members of afghan security forces have been killed, about 17 times the number of u.s. and nato troops who have lost their lives.

in reviewing the past eight years of interactions between the two, we assigned a rough value for how warm or cold relations were between the two (an admittedly subjective analysis). roughly speaking, the periods in which romney has spoken most warmly about trump correlate to moments when romney was seeking political office to which trump might contribute. an exception was shortly after trump took office, when romney offered his support for trump's success.

george conway's federalist society pedigree is impeccable. he has been a member since 1984 — two years after the founding symposium — and he serves on the society's board of visitors. but he has also publicly criticized his wife's boss's actions on occasion. and he shook the conservative legal establishment when, just before the convention, he and a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a group called checks and balances because, they said, trump threatens the rule of law. george conway had even told the new york times that there's a perception out there that conservative lawyers have essentially sold their souls for judges and regulatory reform.

as cabot noted on twitter, one apparent side effect of the trade is that it presumably paves the way for tony romo to possibly join the texans. having lured osweiler away from the broncos last year with a four-year, $72 million contract, houston watched him implode in his first year of being a full-time starter. osweiler eventually lost his job to unheralded backup tom savage, and the texans are happy to get that hefty contract off their books even if they don't land romo.

on wednesday, a successful west coast governor who knows something about trade, democrat jay inslee, suggested he would throw his hat into the ring for 2020. he is pitching himself as the guy to put climate change at the top of the nation's priority list. to govern is to choose, inslee told msnbc's chris hayes. he offered a list of his progressive successes — on voting rights, minimum wages, net neutrality, transportation, etc. — and made the case that green technology makes climate change a jobs message as well. he might consider stressing his entire record as evidence of his ability to successfully govern, which includes climate change policies, and his role in challenging trump's vile immigration policies. almost as an afterthought, he notes that renewable-energy legislation helped launched a multibillion-dollar wind industry and helped his state lead in gdp growth and wages. that seems to be his greatest selling point — creating a progressive haven while growing the economy, raising wages and saving the planet. if inslee can articulate a vision entirely at odds with trump's and evidenced by his successful stewardship, he could be onto something.

in their statement, roy and his fellow freedom caucus members noted that the gop's presidential nominee has won the popular vote only once in the past 32 years: if we perpetuate the notion that congress may disregard certified electoral votes — based solely on its own assessment that one or more states mishandled the presidential election — we will be delegitimizing the very system that led donald trump to victory in 2016, and that could provide the only path to victory in 2024.

despite some incredible athletic performances amid the duress, it has been difficult to present sports on television without large numbers of fans. the tv tricks — fresh camera angles, manufactured crowd noise, dabbling with greater interactivity — couldn't prevent the product from being a glorified scrimmage. for die-hard fans, the outcomes carried emotional value, but it was hard to get past the practical reality: these weren't events as much as they were staged replicas to satisfy lucrative tv contracts.

warnock's attempts to claim the moral high ground haven't sat well with everyone in the black church. in december, more than two dozen church leaders politely asked him to reconsider his pro-choice views, saying his rationalizations reflected grave errors of judgment and a lapse in pastoral responsibility.(at the same time, those leaders praised his efforts to share christ while pursuing political solutions to our most pressing problems today.)

we considered turkmenistan, whose fees for allowing overflights was disclosed through wikileaks, but can find no evidence that trump has spoken to its leader, gurbanguly berdimuhamedov. the white house now rarely discloses when the president speaks with a foreign leader but presumably turkmenistan would have touted such an interaction. turkmenistan, having a border with afghanistan, would potentially face more of threat from the taliban, but that's still a stretch.

even federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. in 2013, years after he spoke at the founding federalist society symposium, and after he won bush v. gore, ted olson returned to the supreme court to overturn a california proposition banning same-sex marriage. for their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the supreme court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, richard hasen, a professor of law and political science at the university of california at irvine, wrote recently in slate.

the federal government is eliminating what had been an unfair benefit. the u.s. constitution does not require that high-tax states can give themselves a large federal tax cut, which is essentially what salt does, said brian riedl, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning manhattan institute, who added of the cuomo lawsuit: it's completely frivolous and there's no basis for it.

historically, diament said, the issue was bipartisan. it's unclear what will happen going forward if the issue gains public attention, but at the moment a mix of lawmakers is supporting the measure to directly fund houses of worship, including republican reps. christopher h. smith (n.j.) and peter t. king (n.y.) and democratic rep. grace meng (n.y.). in the senate it has backing from democrat claire mccaskill and republican roy blunt, both of missouri.
the arrest and guilty plea by butina, 30, has become a sharp thorn in the side of u.s.-russian relations. the first russian national to be convicted of seeking to influence u.s. policy in the 2016 election campaign, moscow has gone to great lengths to paint butina as a political prisoner.

that obstacle was also placed before democratic female candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, as republicans tried to tie them directly to clinton. it has also led some democrats to openly wonder whether the party would be smarter to avoid a female presidential candidate in 2020 — a notion offensive to many in the party.
schools are already strapped for cash, tax collections are down, and it's been hard to pry funding out of washington. if districts are left on their own, there's little doubt that wealthy ones will be far better positioned to help kids catch up than their higher-need, higher-poverty counterparts. schools appear eager to ramp up tutoring in 2021, but who will pay for the project — if anyone — is far less clear.
july 11-13: the 14th netroots nation conference will take place in philadelphia; for the third time, it will feature some sort of forum for democratic presidential candidates. in 2007, that took the form of a debate, which made some news when hillary clinton got into an argument about lobbyists (they represent real americans). in 2015 it became a series of q&as with the candidates who had bothered to show up; both martin o'malley and bernie sanders were interrupted by black lives matter activists. this year, organizers say the format is to be determined.

similarly, norwegian cruise line holdings said guests and crew who have been to mainland china within 30 days will not be allowed to board. the company's cruise lines include norwegian cruise line, oceania cruises and regent seven seas cruises. anyone getting on a ship in hong kong will be screened for a fever, and those with a temperature of 100.4 or higher will not be allowed to board. those who show signs of respiratory illness while sailing will have to undergo additional screening and may be quarantined or forced to leave the ship.
while the family and medical leave act allows employees to take up to 12 weeks to care for an ailing family member, many employees don't know about it, and it only guarantees unpaid time off. a benefit of paid leave for family care may not explode in 2019, sladek said, but she expects enough growth that aon plans to include it in its annual benefits surveys. organizations are getting that 'aha, we solved that problem, but we missed this group.' 
removing the republican grip on the chamber will also afford biden the chance to appoint judges — including a replacement for garland, currently a federal appeals judge, and potentially a supreme court vacancy if any justice steps down. and it immediately clears a path for biden's cabinet and white house nominations, many of whom republicans have been slow to embrace.

some events, and some gaffes, do change the national conversation. but few do so while affecting the individual fortunes of politicians. nearly every democrat asked about tlaib this week had the same response: they did not like the language, and they would prefer that any impeachment talk be shelved until after investigations did or didn't turn up impeachable offenses.
now, remember, this applies only to people who make $10 million or more in a year and only to their incomes starting at that $10 million mark. through dollar number 9,999,999, those people are still paying a bit less than 37 percent on their income. the effect of ocasio-cortez's comments would be that wealthier americans would keep slightly less of their income than they do now, but as they made more money, they'd still be keeping more income, too.
in june, the department of housing and urban development published a notice announcing that it plans to consider revising its 2013 regulation on disparate-impact claims in the fair housing act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion and other factors in sale, rental or financing of housing. the agency signaled that it was reconsidering how the regulations affect the insurance industry, which has challenged them in court.
i've made it my mission as secretary of state to make ohio a place where it is both easy to vote and hard to cheat and by any objective measure we have achieved this goal, husted said in a statement emailed to the washington post.
but some provisions present potential business pitfalls. the bill would generally provide less financial support to lower-income people who currently sign up for insurance through the exchanges. that could create big problems for insurers if it deters people — especially healthy people — from buying coverage, as insurers depend on a mix of healthy and sick people to keep their plans profitable and premiums affordable.

but in a modern economy, creating products and services is a team sport, with individuals constantly interacting with other individuals and firms in complex arrangements that make it much more difficult to determine each person's contribution to overall economic output. there are differences in market power between firms, and differences of individual power within firms, both of which have a significant effect on exactly who earns what.
i think you mean 'will enough americans be vaccinated to reach the herd immunity threshold?' my answer is possibly not because we don't know if the vaccines protect enough against transmission for the threshold to be achievable, and because the new variant may increase that threshold substantially.

the outcome put obama administration officials in a box. they had said corruption was intolerable but also had promised to respect afghan sovereignty and not interfere with the election. moreover, they did not want to completely alienate karzai. if there was another vote, many saw him as the likely victor anyway.
the remaining 13 democrats come from a range of districts, from the most trump-friendly place represented by a democrat (minnesota's 7th) to nevada's 3rd district, where trump actually won a smaller share of the vote than mitt romney; third-party voters were responsible for his win margin.

however, a number of the emails also pointed to the growing threat from al-qaeda and shiite militancy. these tips varied considerably in quality and the types of actions they might have prompted. some reported on particulars about the insurgency, including both weapons and terrorists coming into the country from syria, and where to find weapons caches and safe houses, as you can see below.

proof that firms, when motivated, can quickly diversify their boards came following the death of george floyd last spring, when many companies publicly pledged to promote racial equity. in the past five months, more than 30 firms on the s&p 500 added a black director to boards that had none. perhaps some were also prodded by studies suggesting that diversifying boards yields better corporate financial performance and, as goldman sachs chief executive david solomon put it, reduces . . . groupthink.

state unemployment offices are often saddled with decades-old computer systems that delay the implementation of new programs. oregon was the last state in the nation to waive a one-week waiting period for benefits because it took seven months to reprogram its computer system. oregon, like many other states, uses a computer system based in a 1960s-era programming language called cobol.

the attacks came as u.s. officials continued to defend killing soleimani as a response to months of increased iranian aggression toward americans in iraq. they pointed to his role in directing operations that have left hundreds of u.s. troops dead over the past 20 years.
at the current pace it will take a really long time. … i think if we can get our act together and start vaccinating 1 million people a day like president-elect biden is promising, then we can get to 260 million people getting at least one dose … more or less or by late august or early september. if we really scale up and get to 3 million per day, then we can get to 260 million people in [less than] 100 days or three months. can we do it? yes! but it will require coordination, leadership and funding. so, as you see, my answer is: it depends.
the united states is not powerless to prevent this, but it will likely need to act more forcefully than biden wants to keep the e.u. firmly tied to america. biden would have to force nations such as germany to choose between maintaining the security and economic ties it has with the united states and improving its cooperation with china. that approach is something europeans want to avoid, and president trump's attempts to use the american stick to keep the alliance in line have angered advocates of the transatlantic alliance on both sides of the ocean. but at some point, it will become impossible to square this strategic circle; either the united states or china will use its influence to force the europeans to choose which side they are on. the longer the united states waits to force that choice, the harder it will be to push china back.
trump's attitude toward iran traces back to the 1979 hostage crisis, the first time the young new york real estate developer opined on national tv about a matter of foreign policy. he focused immediately on the notion of acquiring iran's oil: that this country sits back and allows a country such as iran to hold our hostages, to my way of thinking, is a horror, trump said in the 1980 barrett interview. if the united states had sent troops to iran to rescue the american hostages, i think right now we'd be an oil-rich nation, he said, and i believe that we should have done it.
in a televised white house session on dec. 11, trump said he would take responsibility for a shutdown over the wall as house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) said they would not support wall funding.

thanks to years of gop tolerance for surreal thinking on the right, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringe to the center. one poll by fairleigh dickinson university found that 63 percent of registered voters subscribe to at least one such theory. some social science research suggests that people who feel alienated from politics are more prone to thinking conspiratorially. trump capitalized on that climate of suspicion.
some big outdoor spaces, such as the midlands beer garden and biergarten haus, take reservations while leaving most space available for walk-ins — consider a booking an insurance policy — and i'd even think twice about making the trip out to some of the region's bigger farm breweries, including wheatland spring and waredaca, if i hadn't reserved a table in advance. will we return to a more laissez faire system of bar crawls in the future? maybe. in the meantime, i'm going to stick to my calendar.

eliot a. cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for foreign affairs, the president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of u.s. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the united states has sustained for nearly eight decades. he explains, the real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the united states should accept a more modest role in world affairs.

an emeritus professor of physics at princeton university, happer has repeatedly argued that carbon emissions should be viewed as beneficial to society — not a pollutant that drives global warming. during his time with the trump administration, he sought to enlist heartland's help in promoting his ideas and objected to a u.s. intelligence official's finding that climate impacts could be possibly catastrophic, according to documents obtained by the washington post.

the wikileaks report adds to concerns that recently have been raised about smart televisions and spying. the report focuses on government surveillance, but the electronics companies themselves have been accused of using their televisions to invade customers' privacy. last month the federal trade commission settled with television maker vizio, which was accused of collecting and sharing its customers' data without permission. samsung in 2015 drew criticism when its privacy policy included a warning telling people not to have private conversations too near their smart televisions in their own living rooms.

on that score, the constitutional arson likely to be attempted by a depressingly significant number of republican pyromaniacs in congress on wednesday (and maybe into thursday, given the debate rules) could provide the spark. apart from biden, perhaps manchin's own centrism could be tested by such naked efforts to overturn america's democratic institutions and norms. as i have written before, the republican shield for the fossil-fuels business has been effective; but as the party veers ever further away from conservatism toward radicalism, it becomes a liability. georgia's unlikely result probably portends a relatively moderate green policy centered on stimulus spending. the republican reaction could change that.

the goal for aspiring democratic leaders won't simply be extracting a pound of flesh from point-one-percenters. ocasio-cortez invoked the idea as a revenue source for a moonshot proposal — and her party's presidential pool will shortly be teeming with others looking to for ways to pay for similarly ambitious projects.

congress would have violated the 14th amendment had republicans passed a tax bill that, for example, specified that taxes be raised on democratic voters and lowered on republican voters. but the bill's defenders, and even some of its critics, say that there are nonpartisan justifications for capping the deduction. speaker paul d. ryan (r-wis.), for instance, argued throughout that the tax debate that eliminating or paring back the deduction would force blue states to lower their local taxes — not that doing so would help make lives miserable for coastal elites.

apart from the vocabulary attributed to him, president trump is right on target in his sentiment. as individual christians, we have a biblical responsibility to place the needs of others above our own, but as commander in chief, president trump has the constitutional responsibility to place the interest of our nation above the needs of other countries. i'm grateful we have a president like donald trump who understands that distinction and has the courage to protect the well-being of our nation.

if local governments get a substantial proportion of their revenue from property taxes—as most in the united states do—they would have incentives to adopt policies that increase the value of land within their jurisdiction so that they could generate more revenue without raising tax rates. in such a scenario, the possibility of in-migration would serve to bid up prices, even if (by assumption) the changes in price occur so quickly that migrants are deterred from ever actually coming. indeed, the faster the increases in price happen, the faster local governments will be able to reap the benefits of better policies in the form of higher property tax revenue.

the relationship here may have some element of causality. for instance, federal supply-side pressures may have kept heroin just valuable enough to entice cartels and suppliers to keep devising new ways to push the drug into u.s. markets, driving prices down. you get this filtering effect decade after decade where you end up artificially selecting or breeding super-traffickers, sanho tree, a drug policy expert at the institute for policy studies, told vox earlier this year.

(applause) i'm here--i'm here because i believe there's so much that we can do together to advance racial harmony and economic opportunity. before we go to the future, we must acknowledge our past. in the darkest days of the civil war, president lincoln pleaded to our divided nation to remember that we cannot escape history, that we will be remembered in spite of ourselves. one hundred and forty years later, that's still true. for our nation, there is no denying the truth that slavery is a blight on our history and that racism, despite all the progress, still exists today. for my party, there is no escaping the reality that the party of lincoln has not always carried the mantle of lincoln. recognizing and confronting our history is important. transcending our history is essential. we're not limited by what we have done or what we have left undone. we're limited only by what we're willing to do. (applause) our nation must make new a commitment to equality and upward mobility to all of the citizens. this is a great moment of national prosperity, but many still live in prosperity's shadow. the same economy that is a miracle for millions is a mystery to millions as well. from the beginning of this campaign, i have said that prosperity must have a purpose.

it is by far the emptiest his calendar has been since he took office. there have been other periods in which trump has had no scheduled public events on his calendar, but those usually overlapped with holiday periods or the weekends. this doesn't mean he doesn't do anything, as those disclaimers want you to understand. but it doesn't exactly suggest a president who's engaged with his formal responsibilities to the fullest possible extent.

the unrwa dispute is urgent because the organization, which supports schools and humanitarian facilities for refugees in gaza, jordan and the west bank, is already in debt and facing a funding crisis if the money doesn't come through by the end of january. inside the bureaucracy, haley and trump's actions on palestinian funding have caused confusion and spurred backlash by officials at various agencies that deal with unrwa, refugees and relations with allies, including jordan. several government officials told me that haley's public and private actions on unrwa funding have gone far beyond what has been agreed on in the interagency process.
trump has been holed up in the white house instead of vacationing at his mar-a-lago resort in florida, as planned, because of the government shutdown and his standoff with democrats over funding for a border wall.

but a group of ohioans like helle allege they were wrongfully disenfranchised under the use-it-or-lose-it policy, as it's casually known. purporting to represent thousands of other similarly situated ohioans, they sued husted in federal court, arguing the policy violates the u.s. constitution and voting rights law. they were joined by the american civil liberties union of ohio and a homeless advocacy group.
fema's new funding rules were released in an update to the policy guide for the agency. similar rules are in a house measure that passed late last year and in a pending senate bill. they are being challenged by church-state advocacy groups that say they violate the first amendment's prohibition on the government establishing religion.
there is also another, less known corporate entity in the mix: pharmacy benefit managers (pbms), which include express scripts, optumrx and cvs health; all are now named in lawsuits on high insulin prices, but these companies also deny any wrongdoing. pbms manage the prescription drug benefits that are part of insurance plans, working with pharmaceutical companies to negotiate discounts on behalf of insurance providers. every time a pbm extracts a deeper discount, an insulin manufacturer has the incentive to take a price increase to quote 'make themselves whole,'  says rena conti, a health economist at boston university. that's probably one reason why, even as eli lilly's list price for humalog insulin has increased by 175 percent since 2009, the company maintains that its net price — the amount the company earns after rebates, discounts and fees — has remained steady.

what is needed is more clear guidance from the most senior levels in the pentagon, he said in an email to the washington post, singling out miller. the acting secdef in particular should issue a direct statement echoing what [milley], secretary of the army, and chief of staff of the army have all said: there is no role for the military in resolving any election controversies.
when it became clear that most schools weren't going to have students back on campus, another wave of women's job losses hit as they quit their jobs to focus on their homebound children's education and care. in september, 865,000 women left the labor force — more than four times the number of men who left, according to an analysis by the national women's law center.
an internet free of tracking and ads is obviously not google's endgame. after all, the company makes most of its money through advertising — more than $95 billion last year. and while some see this as reforming the ad industry from the inside, google is fielding criticism for the way the blocker is being implemented.
the most significant procedural advantage for biden with democrats in control would be the ability to use the process known as reconciliation to move some parts of his agenda. because biden does not favor ending the filibuster, he would still need 60 votes to enact major policy changes. through reconciliation, a simple democratic majority could do considerable business on spending and tax issues.

it's just so unbelievably difficult to get unemployment. it shouldn't be this hard, especially at a time like this when millions of us are out of work, vaughn said.
indeed, a brief examination of cases suggests the idea has been too wild to suggest. for example, the 10th circuit has rejected the use of a district attorney's campaign statements against certain viewpoints to show that a prosecution he commenced a few days after office was bad faith or harassment. as the court explained, even looking at such statements would chill debate during campaign[s]. if campaign statements can be policed, the court concluded, it would in short undermine democracy: the political process for selecting prosecutors should reflect the public's judgment as to the proper enforcement of the criminal laws. phelps v. hamilton, 59 f.3d 1058, 1068 (10th cir. 1995).
we have to be able to recognize that there is a new industry that has been built out in southwestern pennsylvania, and it is contingent upon clean air and clean water, peduto said, citing uber's and microsoft's recent investments in the region. and that industry is much more important than the legacy and industry of fossil fuel.
right now the entire country is essentially in uncontrolled spread, so every single state is looking for those same limited resources, said marjorie bessel, chief clinical officer at banner health. it's a sad situation to not have had more mitigation be undertaken when all the science showed us exactly what's happening is exactly what we predicted.

that energy continued to be powered by conservative media. fox news leaned into the tea party movement, being described by one research team as a national advocacy organization actively fostering a social protest identity. further from the political center of the party were sites such as breitbart, which not only generated enthusiasm for the movement but encouraged speculation about obama's ancestry.

it's more than an absence of leadership. there's harm being done by denying the problem, said eric buermann, former general counsel to the republican party of florida and a former board chairman for the south florida water management district. he's chilled the discussion, so that those who would want to do something about it feel ostracized. . . . i'm a republican. he's a republican. he's a nice guy. there's nothing negative i have to say about the human being. it's just that the policy is 180 degrees off course.

nationwide, at least 150,000 ballots in the nov. 3 vote — including 1,706 in postal districts that cover georgia — were caught in u.s. postal service processing facilities and not delivered by election day, according to agency data. the postal service also struggled to track 6,624 mailed ballots in those districts, meaning they were recorded entering processing facilities but not exiting them, due to haphazard expediting procedures.
in the absence of strong opposition parties, civic groups and the media have effectively become a major political force, maradiaga said. that's why it is so significant that ortega's government is cracking down on those groups, he told a recent panel organized by the inter-american dialogue think tank in washington.

four years of trump's erratic and incompetent foreign policy has left the biden team with a steep uphill path to restoring u.s. international influence and leadership, which is urgently needed to solve urgent and complex international problems. but competence alone is not a strategy.
romney, as the party's 2012 presidential nominee, a former massachusetts governor and business executive with a powerful financial network, brings a new stature to the anti-trump bloc of the party that has been missing as republicans in washington have operated in a bargaining fashion with trump, enduring his slights and erratic actions to push through favored policy items.
this is the fight the gop faces. it's not really about whether cruz's ploy to use lawyer-speak to give trump a thumbs up will play well in the 2024 primaries. it's about how far from reality the base will get.
so, if voters respond to trump like a generic republican, what does that mean for his ability to shape public support for a new foreign policy strategy? our results suggest that trump could rally republicans and some independents to support typical republican policy positions, like opposition to the iran deal.

after floating this option, trump has said he has no plans to go this route, and most congressional republicans have said it's not a good strategy. but if a legislative fix really can't be found, this could be a way out for all sides. in this scenario, trump declares border security a national emergency, which he would argue allows him to reallocate money to build a wall. it would be challenged in the courts, and while it bounced around the legal system, the government would reopen with both sides being able to claim victory for not caving.
the same goes for south korea, which runs a $26.5 billion trade surplus with the united states. trump has taken aim at the cost of the strategic alliance and criticized a free trade deal agreed between the two countries during the obama administration.
trump immediately course-corrected, contradicting himself: now, i must preface that by saying — because they'll say he just conceded! — no, no, i don't think so. so kelly, if i might add, i think we're going to win, in which case we'll be the last line of defense. it's called veto, veto, veto, veto.

the u.s. economy is expected to come roaring back in 2021 as coronavirus vaccines become more widely available and americans begin to venture out again to restaurants, workplaces and entertainment venues. yet just as the recession hurt low-wage workers more than people in white-collar industries, the recovery will benefit some people much more quickly than others.

the german spy agency, the bnd, came to believe the risk of exposure was too great and left the operation in the early 1990s. but the cia bought the germans' stake and simply kept going, wringing crypto for all its espionage worth until 2018, when the agency sold off the company's assets, according to current and former officials.
business interests covet the check a republican-controlled senate would provide on the incoming biden administration. but the version of the republican party many of them once called home — one that took fidelity to the constitution for granted — is critically endangered. that fact is exemplified by the chaos engulfing the gop as top party officials take sides over whether trump's evidence-free claims of massive voter fraud justify his attempt to subvert the vote.
the transportation projects will be financed by $270 million of state and federal money, as well as tax increment financing in which future local development will pay the costs for construction. in selling the amazon project to the community, local governments have emphasized these long-term capital investments will benefit all users, not just amazon and related businesses.

the president argues that easing these restrictions over time would open the door to iran's attaining nuclear weapons capability, rendering the jcpoa ultimately ineffective. but supporters of the iran deal dispute that and say the jcpoa at least buys time, subjecting iran to strong constraints on its nuclear activities for 10 to 25 years. without the jcpoa, iran could hasten its development of nuclear weapons on an even shorter timeline than the one trump found unacceptable, they say.

is the presence of american troops required there? i do not think it is, putin said. however, let us not forget that their presence, the presence of your troops, is illegitimate as it was not approved by a u.n. security council resolution. the military contingent can only be there under a resolution of the u.n. security council or at the invitation of the legitimate syrian government. russian troops were invited by the syrian government. the united states did not get either of these, so if they decide to withdraw their troops, it is the right decision.

european leaders claim that the agreement will nudge china toward compliance with the rule of law and global democratic norms, but that's a pipe dream. hong kong is a perfect example of that. china has flagrantly violated its promises to maintain hong kong's separate status, including the arrest of at least 53 democracy activists and local legislators tuesday for alleged subversion. china also continues to suppress local tibetan and xinjiang populations, sending residents to what appear to be forced labor camps. the communist government has been clear that it regards global condemnation of its activities as unwarranted interference in its domestic affairs. promises in the deal to adhere to some global practices will prove less worthy than the paper they are printed on.

the letter was submitted as a comment in response to the proposed overhaul of borrower defense to repayment, a statute that wipes away federal loans if a school used illegal or deceptive tactics to persuade students to borrow money for college. one of the requirements of the proposed rule called on for-profit colleges with poor repayment outcomes to warn current and prospective students, a stipulation that jerome argued should be extended to all schools and should at least be based on accurate information, not the flawed data from the scorecard.
during a call that sounded more gangster than presidential, trump called georgia state officials, asking them to find more votes in his favor. the president and some in his party are refusing to accept the outcome of the election, instead sowing doubt and conspiracy. this was an election that multiple independent observers, the courts and both parties have found to be free and fair. to imply otherwise is self-serving and stokes further discord in our country.
trump told aides he was pleased so many had come to washington but was angry that the crowd was not closer to him, a senior administration official said. during his speech, trump griped that the news media got the best seats in the house.
members are eyeing at least two bills with bipartisan support: the creates act, which would prevent branded drugmakers from guarding their medications so other companies can't develop alternatives; and legislation to prohibit pay-for-delay deals in which drugmakers pay producers of generic medicines to delay introduction of cheaper versions of them.
it feels like it was with bush, said bart stupak, a former michigan congressman and a democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the affordable care act. it's all political posturing. the only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the house's attempt at the 20-week ban.

but that outlook depends on the volatility of bitcoin converging with that of gold to encourage more institutional investment, a process that will take some time, they said. on monday, bitcoin slid as much as 17 percent, the biggest drop since march, after breaching $34,000 for the first time over the weekend.
denver drafted a quarterback, memphis's paxton lynch, in the first round last year, but it gave the bulk of the starts this past season to an unheralded second-year player, trevor siemian. the northwestern product acquitted himself respectably, but he led a struggling offense that was called out by members of the broncos' defense, and there is little doubt that a healthy romo would represent an upgrade, at least for a couple of seasons.
the fate of two other trump judicial picks remains unclear.
some aides have tried to persuade trump that he should lay off pence, who is loyal, but trump doubled down. he lashed pence by name a half-dozen times during wednesday's address to the crowd, all but calling him a coward.
democrats will easily be able to pass the bill in the house, with or without significant republican support. but the bill faces difficult odds in the senate, where the bulk of the gop has eschewed the measure's approach, either because they believe trump would not be so politically reckless as to order his attorney general to fire mueller or because they believe it would set an undesirable constitutional precedent by making the president's staffing decisions subject to judicial review.
the next morning, martin and other museum staffers picked up rubber bullets, spray paint cans and protest signs from the streets outside. they added them to their collection of richmond history, along with confederate gen. stonewall jackson's death mask and lee's boots.

it worked almost immediately. soon i had lost enough to register on my home scale again, and i was losing one or two pounds a week. and it wasn't hard to figure out why. i felt compelled to start the 12-hour timer as early as possible, because the earlier i was done eating one day, the earlier i could have breakfast the next. this created two consequences that worked in my favor. first, i stopped snacking at night. no mindless chips in front of the television, no half a pint of ice cream. second, to keep my mind off the snacks i wasn't eating, i walked.

several religious groups battled the obama administration over the affordable care act's mandate that employers and insurers provide no-cost contraceptive coverage for employees. in october, hhs introduced rules expanding the range of businesses that can object to the requirement on religious or moral grounds and receive an exemption.

-- trump has become the silence between the notes of warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy, david weigel writes. when warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the 'million dollars a day' that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former wells fargo chief executive john stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. it's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.

noise can be considered a cardiovascular risk factor, he said. importantly, this is a risk factor that cannot be managed by patients or by doctors; it just can be managed by politicians by making laws with low thresholds for decibel levels during the day and during the night to protect the people living very close to noise sources.
mick mulvaney, a former member of trump's cabinet as white house chief of staff and director of the office of management and budget, announced thursday morning that he has resigned from his post as u.s. special envoy to northern ireland. he said on cnbc that he informed secretary of state mike pompeo: i can't do it. i can't stay.
the narrative that public schools are failing, teachers are widely ineffective, and that politicians and business people are the ones to fix all of these problems can sound more compelling than the truth. and the image of what makes a great teacher can be so narrow for the average person, that many of those fans may not have even known the realities each of us faced that led us to that moment on the field. so here is the truth: america saw 50 or so excellent teachers standing on the field at halftime, but what happened behind the scenes is just as powerful.
it is never too soon to try to get rid of donald trump, said shannon kennedy, a 48-year-old iowan who stood in line to take a selfie in front of a barn-door-size american flag at the orpheum theatre. there is an urgency to get things back on track. our country is a laughingstock right now.

in conversations with top aides on friday and saturday, house democratic leaders said trump and gop leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.
jack ma's disappearance fuels speculation: the alibaba founder's absence from public view in the past two months, including missing the final episode of a tv show on which he was to appear as a judge, has fueled social media speculation over his whereabouts amid a chinese regulatory clampdown on his sprawling business empire, reuters's tony munroe and brenda goh report.
trump removed lt. col. alexander vindman, as well as vindman's twin brother, who did not testify, from their positions at the national security council. alexander vindman witnessed a phone call trump had with ukraine's president in which trump pressured the leader to conduct investigations of trump's democratic rivals.
the study, by alexander hertel-fernandez of columbia university and matto mildenberger and leah c. stokes of the university of california at santa barbara, found that congressional staffers were terrible at estimating constituents' support for various policies. on nearly every issue surveyed — from gun control to environmental regulation to obamacare — staffers in both parties believed the public was more conservative than they actually are.

responding to criticism from the world health organization that china had blocked a scheduled mission to investigate the origins of the coronavirus, beijing on wednesday said the two sides were 'still negotiating,' lily kuo reports. foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told a regular news briefing that the issue of tracing the source of the virus was 'very complicated' and arrangements were needed to 'ensure the smooth progress' of the team of researchers. … an international team of scientists led by the who were to begin a deployment to china on tuesday but who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said the group was barred from traveling to the country … in a rare rebuke of china, tedros said at a news conference on tuesday that he was 'very disappointed.'
he also hinted at problems on the afghan side, including disputes between ghani and some negotiators, who insist that an interim government must be installed because the taliban refuses to recognize his administration and will never make peace with it.

meanwhile, the union said it intends to protest the agency's decision. it contends the meetings are lawfully protected and have been conducted routinely in the past.
two congressional aides briefed on the exchange said trump told schumer the president would look foolish if he backed down now. white house officials didn't respond to requests for comment on this exchange.
in the meantime, there's still plenty of edward valentine art out in the world. one of the most famous is the recumbent statue of lee near the confederate general's tomb at washington and lee university in lexington — which is embroiled in a debate about whether to change the institution's name.
there are plenty of candidates and potential candidates coming to iowa to meet with democratic activists. a day after warren departs sunday, julián castro, the former housing and urban development secretary and san antonio mayor, is planning stops in cedar rapids and iowa city. delaney, who was the first democrat in the race, will open campaign offices here when he returns to iowa for events friday and saturday.
the council on foreign relations' brad setser is probably correct when he notes that china is going to deliver on those commitments where it has agreed to steps that are in its self interest, but not much more. & by doing so, it will raise the stakes of trying to enforce the deal in those areas where it isn't delivering. politico's megan cassella notes that there is increasing frustration among some american businesses and technology companies who feel trump is trading away hard-earned leverage in exchange for an agreement that does little to resolve the systemic issues that led the white house to begin imposing tariffs against china two years ago. to sum up: the trump administration's bargaining posture is highly dubious.
to close the gala, mcgahn and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell settle in armchairs below the giant madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as mcconnell calls it. at the appeals court level, in particular, trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by russell wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution. (at the district court level, however, trump's pace lags behind that of george w. bush and bill clinton.) my goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, mcconnell says. the closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. mcconnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting trump elected. the majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: i hope you are proud of what we've done.

secretary of state mike pompeo is not waiting to leave office to write his own version of history, and he is not doing it in eloquent books. instead, he has taken to the favorite medium of our debased age — twitter — to polish his battered reputation and preen for the possible pursuit of the presidency. his efforts might be said to echo churchill's — if churchill were utterly devoid of literary style, honesty, courage, wit, or principle. in truth, pompeo has taken his inspiration from churchill's contemporary, george orwell, who observed: in our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.

-- british prime minister theresa may urged parliament members to back her brexit deal when it comes up for another vote this month. politico's laura kayali reports: she refused to rule out repeated votes on the same deal if she loses the first time round. … 'don't let the search for the perfect brexit be the enemy of the good,' may said, a reference to the criticisms of hard-line brexiteers and eu supporters such as former european commissioner peter mandelson, who argue the deal undermines british sovereignty and should be rejected. … may slammed mps asking for a second referendum. 'it would divide our country and we wouldn't be able to organize a referendum before march 29 [when brexit will take effect],' she said, pointing out it would therefore require an extension of article 50 (the treaty article allowing withdrawals from the eu).

of course, it was an op-ed piece, not a showdown on the senate floor. and romney, an imperfect messenger, was typically careful in his choice of words. but it was something for anti-trump republicans to seize on and hope that months of grousing and discussions could eventually yield a viable challenge to an incumbent they loathe.

the payoff went beyond the penetration of the devices. crypto's shift to electronic products buoyed business so much that it became addicted to its dependence on the nsa. foreign governments clamored for systems that seemed clearly superior to the old clunky mechanical devices but in fact were easier for u.s. spies to read.
record numbers of migrant families are streaming into the united states, overwhelming border agents and leaving holding cells dangerously overcrowded with children, many of whom are falling sick. two guatemalan children taken into u.s. custody died in december.
ultimately, trump was the logical consequence of a posture followed for decades at the top echelons of the conservative movement: the batty screeds are silly, but since they help us, we won't work zealously to purge them. trump's conspiracy-based capture of the gop has less to do with him and his perspective than with a party that sought and often won the support of people who believe those notions.
according to the interviews, the cia, the u.s. military, the state department and other agencies used cash and lucrative contracts to win the allegiance of afghan warlords in the fight against al-qaeda and the taliban. intended as a short-term tactic, the practice ended up binding the united states to some of the country's most notorious figures for years.

guthrie has taken his views national as the co-founder of the nonprofit schools for climate action (s4ca), which asks schools and other educational groups to pass resolutions highlighting the effects of climate change on children. since december 2017, more than 100 resolutions have been passed, 66 by school boards and 29 by student councils. many set sustainability goals or call on congress to take climate action. most are shepherded by students, who write the resolutions with the help of administrators and school board members.
perry had argued that coal and nuclear power plants would fare better in extreme weather such as the polar vortex that gripped large parts of the nation just four years ago. yet opponents of perry's plan said the current bout of extreme cold undercut perry's argument as regional grids had excess power on hand and many power plants switched from natural gas to oil largely because of cheaper prices. one of the few major outages was the result of a failed transmission line that took a new england nuclear plant offline.
before his confrontation with husted, he gave a short speech about voting rights outside the high court. sen. sherrod brown (d-ohio) joined him in front of the portico, where the senator told reporters his state was engaging in wholesale eliminating names of people who have served our country or people who haven't.

moreover, many teachers are unequipped to deal with it. a survey from the national center for science education and penn state's survey research center during the 2014-15 school year found that fewer than half of the teachers responding had taken a formal course on climate change. the same survey found that only two-thirds of teachers said they emphasize that human activity is the primary driver of climate change, despite the scientific consensus that humans are the cause. (jeanne kaidy, a high school science teacher in rochester, n.y., told me she gets a distressing amount of pushback from students and teachers disputing the science.)
all seven counties have white majorities. buncombe county, which includes asheville, is 91 percent white. yet five of the new sheriffs defeated white incumbents. another beat the retiring sheriff's white heir apparent. the seventh, cumberland county's ennis wright, was appointed in 2017 to fill a vacancy and faced voters for the first time.

the upshot is that, as biden seeks to deliver his green agenda, the emphasis is less likely to be on mandates and more on money — in the form of an expanded, green-tinted stimulus bill — at least in the short term. this fits with biden's emphasis on job-creation as a way to sell climate action to the american public in the context of recovery from the pandemic. it also fits with his appointments at the department of energy and other agencies, which portend a focus on executive action to coordinate industrial policy to boost green technologies and reverse outgoing president donald trump's own executive actions to support fossil fuels.
german chancellor angela merkel said she was furious and sad about the scenes at the capitol. british home secretary priti patel told the bbc that trump's comments directly led to the violence. scotland's first minister, nicola sturgeon, was more explicit, telling good morning britain that trump was guilty of inciting insurrection and calling his presidency a dark period in america's history.

in particular, they heaped scorn on units known as the afghan local police, or alp. with about 30,000 personnel, the local police are militias organized at the village level. although they were established in 2010 at the behest of the united states — and trained by the u.s. military — they quickly generated a reputation for brutality and drew complaints from human rights groups.
not far from the capitol, she'll find gonzaga college high school, where the higher achievement program was founded in 1975 on the principle of school choice. our founder, a teacher at gonzaga — greg gannon — saw the outstanding education inside the school's walls and the dearth of opportunity in the surrounding neighborhood, and he took action. through its rigorous, multi-year after-school and summer programs, higher achievement has helped place thousands of students in top high schools in washington, baltimore, richmond and pittsburgh.

[trump's transition team said the broker had the discretion to decide which securities to buy and sell in price's account.]
the histories, which do not address when or whether the cia ended its involvement, carry the inevitable biases of documents written from the perspectives of the operation's architects. they depict rubicon as a triumph of espionage, one that helped the united states prevail in the cold war, keep tabs on dozens of authoritarian regimes and protect the interests of the united states and its allies.

his efforts to galvanize supporters online are having concerning consequences. the conservative social media site parler and the encrypted app telegram are filling up with references to potential violence as trump called his supporters to gather in d.c. to protest the congressional vote, which has traditionally been a largely ceremonial process, my colleagues craig timberg and drew harwell report.

she talked to republicans about how efforts to promote voter integrity and campaign finance reform were weaponized by democrats as a way of limiting the political power of conservatives, norquist said. she had a working knowledge of the democratic party and brought to republicans an awareness of how democrats were advocating for politics that would effectively shut down political opponents.
for helle, the moment was more than six years in the making. in 2011, he returned from tours in iraq and afghanistan and tried to vote in a local election, only to be told that poll workers couldn't find his name. a couple of months later, in the general election, he was blocked again. this time, board of elections officials revealed he had been removed from the state's roll due to inactivity.
the impasse marks washington's latest failure in over nearly three decades of trying to reach consensus on a comprehensive overhaul of a massive immigration system that both political parties agree is largely broken. there are an estimated 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the united states, according to a recent estimate from pew research center, and there is no political consensus over their future.

the resulting report, submitted to house speaker michael e. busch (d-anne arundel) on thursday, says morhaim leveraged his influence as a lawmaker to advocate for policies that could have resulted in gains for himself.
but if sb97 is enacted, the elbonian divorce must be ignored, because it was entered under a legal system that denied the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the montana constitution or the united states constitution, such as equal rights regardless of sex, or the first amendment right not to be treated differently based on religion. the divorce decree would therefore be void, and thus couldn't be considered by american courts.

on wednesday, as warren greeted lawmakers in boston on the opening of the commonwealth's legislative session, there was chatter about her chances.
but after a year of lower-profile candidates heading to iowa, the stakes for warren are high. this is the first 2020 event at which crowdsmanship, the practice of scanning turnout for a candidate to see if they have the juice, will be in effect. warren's first event on saturday is at one of sioux city's largest arts venues, one that clinton rallied in ahead of the 2016 caucuses. turnout of less than 2,000 would leave the venue looking somewhat empty — something pointed out to us by an operative for another democrat who may run for president.
trump, speaking thursday at the white house, also said the passenger jet could have been downed in error. well, i have my suspicions, he said. i don't want to say that, because other people have those suspicions also. . . . somebody could've made a mistake on the other side.
while dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. about 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the guttmacher institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by planned parenthood.

the most important part was, if we really believed in his message, we needed to grab a clipboard and start knocking on doors, guzman, 47, said of obama's impact.
national association of manufacturers ceo jay timmons said disappointment in the election outcome does not justify harming our democracy or undermining faith in our elections based on unproven charges and conspiracy theories… now we ask congress to join us in healing our nation, instead of fostering more division and vitriol.
something we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. in the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. a modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. an advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.
trump, he said, is slowing down and he's reevaluating his policies in light of those three objectives.

every winter, we ask washington post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big ideas, arguments, questions and problems that the new year will bring. of course, if there's one thing we learned over the last 12 months, it's that what we don't expect can matter even more than what we do: the first cases of the unexplained pneumonia that would become the coronavirus pandemic, after all, were announced quietly on dec. 30, 2019. what will be on our minds when we remember 2021 a year from now? here is outlook's fifth annual year in preview.
in the weeks leading up to the november election, we conducted an experiment involving more than 1,500 american adults whom we contacted through qualtrics, a prominent market research firm. our sample included an equal number of democrats, republicans and independents, as well as an equal number of men and women.

it would thus be far from surprising if there were also fsb agents looking to demonstrate their own worth by, say, arresting an american spy within a stone's throw of the kremlin. that last bit, of course, is speculation. and that's the point: all of this is speculation. spy stories always are.
but in 2020, house republicans worked harder to recruit and fund female candidates. rep. susan brooks (ind.), this year's national republican congressional committee's recruitment chair, made identifying and supporting female candidates a priority. after few republican women were elected in 2018, rep. elise stefanik (n.y.) launched a leadership pac that focused media and party attention on the need to recruit more women. her pac worked with other organizations, particularly winning for women and view pac, in identifying and funding female candidates.

at the national security council, biden is expected to give the job of deputy national security adviser to jon finer, according to two people familiar with the decision. finer is a former washington post reporter who worked in a number of jobs in the obama administration that culminated in his role as director of policy planning at the state department. after leaving the administration, he worked at the council on foreign relations and joined a private equity firm co-founded by the father of antony blinken, biden's nominee for secretary of state.

his apologists strain to explain that he didn't mean what we heard, romney writes on facebook, calling it a defining moment for trump. but what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.
the warnings didn't work. the dea decided to get tougher. it had several tools at its disposal, in ascending order of severity: it could send a company a letter of admonition warning it to follow the law; it could send an order to show cause demanding to know why operations should not be shut down for failing to report suspicious orders; it could issue an immediate suspension order instantly halting operations; or it could bring a civil or criminal enforcement case with heavy fines.

trump is scheduled to speak about the senate vote to acquit him of the two house impeachment charges at the white house on thursday — an event that will serve as an indication whether he's ready to move on from romney's vote or try to make him another of example of what happens to republicans who cross him.
this isn't to attack the voters. they put in a lot of time and effort, and they are sincere in their efforts to attempt to choose the players they feel are worthy. the public perception seems to be that because the selection process falls mostly to media members, owens is being kept out because he had a rocky relationship with the media. that's not the case.
predicting the winner? is that success? even if journalists could do that (and they can't) it would not be much of a public service, would it? a very weird thing about horse race or 'game' coverage is it doesn't answer to any identifiable need of the voter. should i vote for the candidate with the best strategy for capturing my vote?

different parts of the government put their faith in different scenarios. the military was always more cautious about air power than the state department, the former official said. a state department official responded: our job is to pursue diplomatic options. balkans policymakers in foggy bottom, this official said, believed that political objectives would not be achieved without a credible threat of force, but that does not mean that anyone was predicting [a] rosy scenario in which milosevic would quickly back down. white house officials, meanwhile, are bristling at what they see as revisionist history from many retired military commanders commenting on the crisis, as well as at some whispered background comments from current officers – that the military had argued for keeping the ground option alive. they were the ones who were most against it, one senior administration official said. © copyright 1999 the washington post company back to the top

trump's removal of maguire exacerbated long-standing tensions between intelligence officials and the president. intelligence leaders have long been some of trump's favorite targets on twitter and at campaign rallies, where he portrays them as members of a deep state bent on sabotaging his reelection.

of the 481,550 vaccines supplied to virginia, 116,247 — or about 25 percent — were reported to have been administered as of tuesday morning, according to the state health department. officials say that a new online data system has slowed the reporting process and that more vaccines have actually been administered. but that didn't stop northam from imposing a use it or lose it policy to punish providers who are giving out vaccine slowly.
george papadopoulos george papadopoulos sergei millian, a key source for the dossier compiled by a former british spy, told certain individuals during the campaign that he was in touch with papadopoulos, a campaign adviser. papadopoulos met with foreign leaders and gave an interview criticizing u.s. sanctions on russia.
it wasn't nearly as elaborate, or secure, as the enigma machines being used by the nazis. but hagelin's m-209, as it became known, was portable, hand-powered and perfect for troops on the move. photos show soldiers with the eight-pound boxes — about the size of a thick book — strapped to their knees. many of hagelin's devices have been preserved at a private museum in eindhoven, the netherlands.

the cia and the bnd declined to comment, though u.s. and german officials did not dispute the authenticity of the documents. the first is a 96-page account of the operation completed in 2004 by the cia's center for the study of intelligence, an internal historical branch. the second is an oral history compiled by german intelligence officials in 2008.
since taking over in 2017, trump has continued to assert that a wall is needed but has backed away from insisting that mexico pay for it. he has instead said the money should come from u.s. taxpayers, an idea that has divided republicans. but many republicans, some reluctantly, have agreed to follow his lead during the current shutdown.

esper, who had not appeared on camera to discuss the strike until tuesday, blamed iran for its history of attacks over the past 40 years when asked if the united states also has a responsibility to de-escalate tensions between the two countries.
not everyone, however, is on board with guthrie's agenda. last spring, guthrie and a number of s4ca partners — including several students — lobbied the national association of school psychologists to adopt a resolution stating that climate change is a children's issue, as the group's california chapter had done. but the organization declined. the group's executive director, kathleen minke, responded in an email to guthrie that her group focuses on issues that have a very direct impact on schools, student learning and children's mental and behavioral health. climate change, she said, falls outside this professional focus. when i interviewed her later, minke told me that her organization isn't ignoring climate change and has dedicated resources to help school psychologists deal with kids affected by natural disasters. but when it comes to managing anxiety, their focus is on coping, not causes. you're not going to develop an entire curriculum around anxiety related to 'x,'  she says. there are too many x's for that to be efficient.

another unidentified senior u.s. official told government interviewers, however, that u.s. spy agencies had known about troubles inside kabul bank a year before the meltdown.
the cycle had a calamitous impact on foreign policy. by 1812, misguidedly convinced that only military combat could purge the nation of british interference, democratic-republicans declared a war on britain that reduced the capital to ashes two years later. since republicans' ill-advised impeachment of president bill clinton in 1998, americans have once more edged ever closer to criminalizing political difference. the trend accelerated in 2016 when trump supporters cheered for the imprisonment of hillary clinton with gleeful cries of lock her up!
two former u.s. deputy attorneys general have defended cardinal, one of the big three companies, along with mckesson and amerisourcebergen, that together control 85 percent of drug distribution in the united states. jamie gorelick, an attorney for wilmerhale, was deputy attorney general under president bill clinton. craig s. morford, cardinal's chief legal and compliance officer, was acting deputy attorney general under president george w. bush.
the report starts with this warning:
every day, border patrol encounters roughly 2,000 illegal immigrants — we have to talk about this — trying to enter our country. two thousand a day, and that's a minimum.
but there already are signs that barrett's replacement of liberal icon ruth bader ginsburg could diminish roberts's pivotal role. barrett provided the fifth and decisive vote to do away with the court's general deference to local officials regarding pandemic restrictions — the position roberts had championed. she joined fellow conservative justices clarence thomas, samuel alito, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh to strike a blow for religious organizations that had chafed at what they said were unconstitutional boundaries on their right to worship.
we relocated here thinking it would be a really great life decision, sara dean said as her 2-year-old son, patrick, played on the floor. you're supposed to hear about this somewhere else. this is the most average of average communities that there could be. it's 'leave it to beaver' average. if it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.
the district also is offering vaccinations to people 16 or older with serious health problems. residents who have conditions such as cancer, diabetes or kidney or liver disease, or who have a body mass index of 30 or higher can seek a vaccine through their doctor or the city's public registration system.
as a result, lara doesn't benefit much from the $10,000 in loan forgiveness that biden proposes. if she happens to owe $28,400, and $10,000 is forgiven, thereby dropping her balance to $18,400, she will save $1,000. if she owes more than $29,400, she won't benefit from debt forgiveness at all — she'll end up paying the same proportion of her income for 15 years.
those issues and others are to be reviewed by a cabinet-level task force that will study how to deal with the most vexing legacies of the bush administration's detention program, obama said.
the financial industry, understandably, is not super keen on this independent federal agency. and neither is hensarling, who — just coincidentally? — has received generous campaign contributions from the finance industry.
women need to be asked to run, simonds said, explaining the roots of her first campaign. women are taught as girls to be part of the team, be part of the family, not necessarily to demand the attention of everyone.
yet over the past seven decades, such voices — pro-fact, pro-science and pro-reason — lost the internal debate over how to treat the tinfoil-hat folks. and such moments of truth-telling by republicans at all levels have been fleeting and rare.

then, they discussed attending an immigration forum in the new year, and a member of the group started to run down the list of guests. they included jessica ramos, their new state senator. and catalina cruz, the formerly undocumented immigrant whom they elected to the state assembly.
that is why a group of more than 20 organizations and businesses started meeting last year to find areas of agreement around these thorny issues. some were for-profit developers such as jbg and eya; others were advocates for tenants who have tangled with for-profit developers, such as the latino economic development center. the coalition included affordable-housing advocates, faith groups and policy analysts.
sweeping these problems under the rug undermines public trust in our institutions of government, amelia chassé said.
the long definition stated that the objective for u.s. and nato forces was to reduce the capability and will of the insurgency, support the growth in capacity and capability of the afghan national security forces (ansf), and facilitate improvements in governance and socio-economic development, in order to provide a secure environment for sustainable stability that is observable to the population.
climate change, say chris and his wife, amber, is a big topic of discussion in their home. colin and arianna have always shown an interest in the environment. they've cried over nature documentaries about the destruction of the coral reefs and sought out coverage of 17-year-old swedish climate activist greta thunberg.
but the risk is not as great as rick suggests. even if the governments in question are just selecting policies at random and do not care about their effect on foot voters, there is still a great deal of inertia in government, especially when it comes to changing long-established policy. interest groups, bureaucracies, and others who have become habituated to the status quo will not easily accept change. if a policy has been in place for a long time, that is some evidence that it is unlikely to be radically altered in the short to medium term future.
the justices peppered the attorneys for the parties with questions about whether the policy was a reasonable and legally sound way for the state to prune its voter lists. but the real fireworks happened outside.
the justice department is seeking to change interpretation of title vi of the 1964 civil rights act, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin by recipients of federal funding. under these rules, actions are considered discriminatory if they have a discriminatory effect, what's known as a 'disparate impact,' on protected groups. under the new version, only intentional discrimination would be prohibited, laura meckler and devlin barrett report. the trump administration has been considering this change for more than two years but waited until its final weeks to try to put it into effect. … the justice department currently distributes about $6 billion a year in grants or awards … the planned change was pushed in late december by william p. barr, one of his last acts as attorney general. … typically regulations of this magnitude are published first as proposals and the government collects public comment before publishing its final version. it would be unusual to publish a final regulation — particularly one of this magnitude — without going through that process, but the document says that its proposal falls under an exception and therefore the administration is not required to seek public comment.
the executive branch wants faith-based and community organizations, to the fullest opportunity permitted by law, to compete on a level playing field for grants, contracts, programs, and other federal funding opportunities, trump wrote in the executive order.
within minutes, macmillan and his friend were inoculated, providing them a route out of the pandemic. macmillan plans to head back to the pharmacy jan. 29 for the second dose of a vaccine that studies show is better than 90 percent effective against the virus, which has killed more than 359,000 people in the united states, according to data compiled by the washington post.

both appear willing to do whatever it takes to stay in trump's good graces. they are also reliable corporate allies, hailing from c-suites themselves. perdue was a senior executive at reebok during a business career he capped by serving as ceo of dollar general.
in that case, moscow never denied that the 10 were russian spies. the people sent west in exchange — all of them russian citizens, including sergei skripal — were convicted of similar offenses at home. but moscow has steadfastly denied the charges against butina, who in any case did not go on trial for espionage. a whelan-for-butina swap, then, would be heavily out of whack, and thus out of keeping with russian diplomatic practice.
trump says that sen. john mccain (r-ariz.) was not a hero because he was captured after being shot down over vietnam.
it specifically noted how he pushed medical marijuana regulators to lift a cap on the number of licenses awarded to processing facilities while the company with which he was affiliated was seeking such a license. that company, doctor's orders, later said it did not support the proposed change.
the administration has yet to issue a decision in that case.
i have a very simple rule, which is, i'm engaged in the battle of ideas, and i care very deeply about our constitution and the role of courts in our society, he said. and i don't waste my time on stories that involve money and politics because what i care about is ideas.
to me, it's very compelling, giving the first doses to more people as soon as possible, given this exponential growth we're seeing in a lot of places, dowd said. under reasonable assumptions, that would save a lot more lives and hospitalizations and prevent more severe disease than doing the complete course on half the number of people in the next three months or so.
kelly has been criticized by some for his reaction to the interruption.

and the report was critical of the school security program operated by broward county public schools. the report said it failed to stop the alleged shooter, nikolas cruz, a former student with a history of disciplinary problems and mental health concerns, from entering the school feb. 14 with a semiautomatic rifle and killing 14 students and three staff members. neither the school nor the district had a clear plan to lock down classrooms. it took several minutes for that to happen, leaving students, teachers and staff members vulnerable to being shot, it said.
missouri's bill would report parents who consent to such treatment to child welfare officials for child abuse. doctors also would have their licenses revoked if they perform gender-reassignment treatments.
before adams filled out into his burly 265-pound frame, he was, by his own account, a tall, scrawny and weak child who was overpowered and out-leveraged on the rugby pitch by shorter, stouter opponents. his rugby position, as in basketball, was unglamorous: he served as a lock, the rough equivalent of offensive lineman in american football. locks form human walls to push as a unit during scrums, the sport's central conflicts which pit players without helmets against each other in violent struggles.
if the virus spreads quite a bit, the market will work through a bad quarter or two of bad economic activity, said scott wren of wells fargo investment institute. it's all about whether people are going to be out there spending or if they are going to be home hiding.

the happiest people in the world right now are the leaders of china. the second happiest are the leaders of iran, trump said. what we would've done in the next four years, we would have been on a footing like nobody's ever, and now we're giving it all away.
these are not sob stories. they are examples of lower american productivity because of inadequate child-care funding. access to high-quality care for young children can help parents increase their employment and earnings, a white house report on the economics of early childhood investments said in 2015. parents who have child care options are better able to work, and to work more hours.
at the height of the outbreak, a number of countries imposed travel restrictions on flights in and out of mexico, which resulted in a 40 percent decrease in traffic volume. a vaccine has been developed for h1n1, but due to the cyclical nature of flu season, new strains pop up — e.g., h7n9 — which has caused a spike in flu-related deaths as recently as 2018.
to its frustration, germany was never admitted to the vaunted five eyes, a long-standing intelligence pact involving the united states, britain, australia, new zealand and canada. but with the crypto partnership, germany moved closer into the american espionage fold than might have seemed possible in world war ii's aftermath. with the secret backing of two of the world's premier intelligence agencies and the support of two of the world's largest corporations, crypto's business flourished.
even so, the moves on defense come as a surprise. the falcons were young and fast on defense. the defense got better as the season progressed, and it gave brady and the patriots problems into the third quarter of the super bowl.
during the clinton years, the crackpot theorizing became harder and harder to distinguish from the republican party itself. conservative billionaire richard mellon scaife sent investigators to arkansas to dig up dirt on the president's past, and when they failed, they settled for salacious fabrications that bill clinton was part of a drug-smuggling ring. scaife became what the washington post called a guiding force behind gingrich's contract with america and a later generation of tea party activists. the rev. jerry falwell, a leader of the religious right (his son is a big trump supporter), started selling a $43 videotape that, among other charges, said clinton was responsible for the deaths of countless people.

working toward a version of universal health care has been a democratic goal for decades. but it seemed to pick up some momentum after sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) pushed for medicare for all during his presidential campaign in 2016. the next year, house democrats cosponsored h.r. 676, a medicare for all bill.
and the payment system is gradually shifting away from fee for service, or paying for each procedure. instead, doctors and hospitals are increasingly paid for keeping people healthy — making costly procedures less attractive as a potential revenue stream.
one reason is that democrats have been reluctant to use anti-government theories to tear down the things they would prefer to burnish, such as government and international institutions that they believe work for social justice and economic progress. republicans' conspiracy theories about powerful secret actors are consistent with their small-government views; it is a shorter leap for conservatives to portray washington as a swamp where individualism, justice and decency go to die.
will it really hurt us among young voters? it could, reed acknowledged, but he added: you cannot ignore a federal law on the books. it breeds cynicism. it undermines respect. it undermines confidence in government itself.
to no one's surprise, the new government calls for reducing immigration to europe. in the second half of 2018, austria will preside over the e.u. council; the coalition agreement states that in that position, one priority will be protecting e.u. borders with the rest of the world.

the government is trying to shut down all political dissidence and impose a reign of fear and terror, targeting its opponents, said paulo abrão, director of the human rights commission of the organization of american states (oas).
it was really inspiring to see a democratic candidate who was a person of color inspire so many people, said guzman, one of the early opponents of the federal 287(g) agreement championed by stewart that allowed the county to hold incarcerated undocumented inmates for deportation after their jail sentences expired.
the extramarital relationship itself, however, may have been the least explosive part of the story.
the recent spate of crises has called to attention the need to prepare, as best we can, for something similar to happen in the future. as a homeowner, there are certain considerations and affairs to get in order to prepare for these disasters — whether it's insurance matters, property protection measures or communication precautions. but if you're among the growing population of individuals choosing to rent in america, you might find yourself feeling anxious and unsure about where responsibility lies in these emergency situations.
d.c., for a variety of reasons, didn't embrace street dining the way surrounding jurisdictions did — two round-the-clock, one-block closures north of dupont circle and the reclaimed service lane across from the uptown theater in cleveland park were more notable than a weekend-only closure of eighth street nw in penn quarter. (the closure of 18th street nw in adams morgan, which nightlife advocates have long encouraged, lasted only one weekend because of complaints about crowding and lack of masks.) where the city made the biggest impact was loosening restrictions on sidewalk cafes and allowing restaurants to turn adjacent parking spaces into parklets through the duration of the public health emergency. it was fun to see businesses get creative, decorating these spaces with greenery, tapestries, lights (and eventually heaters) to appeal to passersby and capture the personalities of the different establishments. even after bars and restaurants are back to normal business, these should continue indefinitely, or be grandfathered in with a nominal annual rent.
in new york, a lawsuit alleges that a large apartment complex in queens will not rent to anyone with a criminal record, and that this has the effect of discriminating against african american and latino renters. the suit is pending, relying on disparate impact to make the case.
the two decisions represented a u-turn in d.c. jurisprudence. the courts had previously been more deferential to the d.c. zoning commission, a hybrid federal-local body that makes the final decision on many large development projects. and these reversals may not be the last: responding to the unexpected victories in these two cases, opponents have begun appealing approved developments across the city.
in 1982, when argentina became convinced that its crypto equipment had betrayed secret messages and helped british forces in the falklands war, widman was dispatched to buenos aires. widman told them the nsa had probably cracked an outdated speech-scrambling device that argentina was using, but that the main product they bought from crypto, the cag 500, remained unbreakable.
the supply-and-demand realities of the drug trade are why reform groups, like the drug policy alliance, say that federal funds would be better spent helping drug users, rather than cracking down on drug suppliers. you can take out a heroin dealer, but the addictions he's feeding will remain. another dealer will happily step forward to serve those addictions as long as demand remains.
you just don't pay attention to it, he added. it's hard sometimes when people are just talking, but when it comes down to it, it's keeping your head down and keep pushing and not worrying about people that aren't in our locker room and going through things we're going through. and keep it real tight.
in the prime minister's view, there is no way to ensure the stability of iraq without the withdrawal of foreign forces, said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue with candor.

for about a year after the scandal became public, the u.s. embassy in kabul, led by then-ambassador karl eikenberry, made the case a top priority and pressed karzai to take action, three former officials told government interviewers. but they said the embassy backed off after eikenberry was replaced by ryan crocker in july 2011.
any agreement with the kurds would be a boon for assad, who has retaken control of much of the country. it would also be a win for assad's allies in russia and iran. the trump administration had earlier made countering iran one of its key goals in the middle east, but at a recent cabinet meeting, trump suggested that he wasn't worried about iranian influence in syria.
i've just tried to be a sponge here, man, sarkisian said ahead of friday's rose bowl win over notre dame, calling saban the best to ever do it. he said: and then a year ago i had a couple opportunities to become a head coach, and i decided to come back because it felt like my work here wasn't done. you know, i felt like i owed it to him. i made a commitment to him to be part of this program. . . .
