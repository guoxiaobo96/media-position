{"original": "In Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said intelligence analyses indicated that a surface-to-air missile hit the plane in what could have been an unintentional act.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Washington, U.S. officials expressed high confidence that the Boeing 737-800, bound for the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, was targeted by air-defense systems as Iranian forces were on high alert. President Trump said the downing of the aircraft was probably a mistake.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrudeau's comments — as his nation mourned 63 Canadians on the flight and dozens of others with links to the country — came after U.S. officials said the plane was apparently hit by an SA-15 surface-to-air missile, part of a Russian-made air defense system also known as a Tor system.\\n\\nThe U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, offered no other details on the circumstances that led to the possible missile firing Wednesday, which came about four hours after Iran launched ballistic missiles into Iraq against U.S. targets in retaliation for the killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani.\\n\\nIran has repeatedly rejected theories of a missile strike. A military spokesman on Wednesday called it ridiculous. Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency labeled the claims Thursday a psychological operation waged by the Pentagon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Western officials built their case, it was unclear whether Iran would publicly acknowledge the direction of the probe or offer further details on the minutes after the flight left the runway, rose toward 8,000 feet, then burst into flames without a distress call.\\n\\nAnd with the region on edge, Iranian military leaders could be put in a difficult spot, with commanders left to face possible questions about procedures or even the locations of antiaircraft sites.\\n\\nTrudeau, speaking to reporters, said the missile-strike conclusion was based on intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence.\\n\\nThe evidence indicates the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile. This may well have been unintentional, he said, without giving further details.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, speaking Thursday at the White House, also said the passenger jet could have been downed in error. Well, I have my suspicions, he said. I don't want to say that, because other people have those suspicions also. . . . Somebody could've made a mistake on the other side.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome people say it was mechanical, Trump added. Personally, I don't think that's even a question.\\n\\nIn London, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the growing consensus around the missile strike. He cited a body of information that the flight was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.\\n\\nThe Washington Post obtained a video that allegedly shows the moment the airliner is struck in midair. The video, first published by the New York Times, purportedly shows a missile intercepting the aircraft, followed by a loud boom.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFlight tracking data from Flightradar24 showed the Ukrainian airliner taking off from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport in a northwesterly direction before losing contact near the suburb of Parand.\\n\\nMichael Elleman, director of the Non-proliferation and Nuclear Policy Program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the general area about 12 miles northwest of Tehran's airport is known to be filled with Iranian missile facilities, which could have been protected by antiaircraft systems. The Iranian government may have suspected the missile sites could be targets for a retaliation by the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Tor system dates to the Cold War and can target planes, helicopters, drones or incoming missiles. Russia has exported the system to a number of countries, including Iran in 2005. It is designed to hit targets in the short-to-medium range.\\n\\nUkrainian investigators\\n\\nA team of 45 experts and search-and-rescue personnel from Ukraine arrived in Tehran early Thursday to participate in the probe, as well as to identify and repatriate the bodies of the 11 Ukrainians aboard, including all nine crew members.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBefore the U.S. and Canadian statements, Ukrainian investigators had said they were also looking at a range of theories — including the possibility of antiaircraft fire.\\n\\nOleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Facebook that his team wanted to search for possible debris from a Tor air-defense missile, after seeing online reports about the discovery of possible fragments of one near the crash site.\\n\\nUkraine is familiar with the risks that antiaircraft weapons can pose to civilian aircraft in times of conflict.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a missile shot from a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile system from rebel territory in eastern Ukraine. The attack on the Boeing 777, which was passing over the conflict zone while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, killed all 298 people aboard.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA joint investigative team from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia, the Netherlands and Ukraine identified a Russian military unit in charge of the antiaircraft missile system and has pursued prosecution of Russian and Ukrainian citizens allegedly involved. Russia has denied any involvement in the incident.\\n\\nDanilov said that Ukraine's investigative commission for the Tehran crash includes specialists who helped investigate the Flight 17 crash site. The government in Kyiv has also suspended all Ukrainian flights over Iranian and Iraqi airspace.\\n\\nIran's air-defense structure\\n\\nThe responsibility for air defense traditionally falls to Iran's Air Defense Force command, said Saeid Golkar, a political science professor at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga who has studied Iranian security forces for 20 years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOrders to mobilize the country's air defense are given by a central command center, which includes air-defense batteries controlled by Iran's two armed forces: the regular military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Within this system, the Revolutionary Guard is also in control of its own air-defense systems and has the capability of acting without authorization, Golkar said.\\n\\nIt is possible that the IRGC acted alone? Golkar asked.\\n\\nIf you asked me if its possible if someone mistakenly shot it down, I'd say yes, because of the whole informality of the system, Golkar said.\\n\\nA preliminary report from Iran's Civil Aviation Organization said witnesses — on the ground and among the crew of another flight in the vicinity — reported seeing a fire while the Boeing 737-800 was still in the air, followed by an explosion when it slammed into a field near an amusement park.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA video from a closed-circuit television camera posted on Twitter by Iran's state broadcaster showed the predawn darkness suddenly lit in a fiery orange glow and then flaming debris scattering over a wide area.\\n\\nThe trajectory of the collision indicated that the plane was initially moving toward the west, but after encountering a problem, it turned to the right and was approaching the airport again at the time of the crash, Ali Abedzadeh, head of the Civil Aviation Organization, said in the report.\\n\\nIranian officials said immediately after the crash that the plane had encountered technical problems, but that did not appear in the report, which also noted that there was no distress call from the aircraft.\\n\\nThe passengers on the plane were mostly Iranians but also included Europeans and Canadians.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Iranian report said the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder were recovered but were damaged. Abedzadeh has said Iran will not share those black boxes with Boeing, but other countries have been invited to participate in the investigation in accordance with international guidelines.\\n\\nJohn Cox, an airline safety consultant and former pilot, said Iranian officials have indicated they will conduct their probe in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organization Annex 13, which outlines the process by which international crashes are investigated. Under the protocols, the United States has a right to participate in the probe because the jet was built and certified in the country.\\n\\nThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on Thursday declined to say whether it will participate in the investigation. However, two people with knowledge of the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly said the safety body had been asked by the ICAO to take part in the probe.\\n\\nStill, U.S. sanctions against Iran, which include limits on travel and information-sharing, will complicate any U.S. involvement.\\n\\nNTSB officials would have to seek a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to travel to Iran, a process can take months or even years, experts say. And even if they secure a license, U.S. officials may still be limited in what information they can share with Iranian officials.\\n\\nCanada cut diplomatic ties with Iran about a decade ago. Trudeau said that while there had been openness from Iranian officials to involve Canada in the investigation, access had not yet been given to them. Iran wanted to keep the black boxes there but told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukrainian investigators would have access to them, Trudeau said.\\n\\nAt his news conference, Trudeau dodged questions about whether the United States should bear some responsibility since its killing of Soleimani last week escalated tensions in the region.\\n\\nI think that's one of the many questions that people will be thinking about and trying to find answers to, he said. But for the moment, I just want to underline the importance of having a full and credible investigation so that we can get those facts, and then we can continue to analyze based on these facts.\\n\\nUkraine International Airlines's president offered his condolences to relatives of the 176 people killed when one of its planes crashed on Jan. 8 near Tehran.

{"original": "A recent Quinnipiac poll says that more Americans would vote for former vice president Joe Biden if he ran for president. It certainly wouldn't be a landslide win: 48 percent of respondents said they'd pick Biden, while 44 percent said they wouldn't be inclined to vote for him.\\n\\nBiden has not ruled out running in 2020, after opting not to enter the race in 2016, citing the death of his son Beau Biden and a need to focus on family. But, if elected, Biden would be 78 years old when entering the White House. The former vice president ranks at No. 2 behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on The Fix's list of top 2020 contenders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile Biden is No. 2 on the list, it's not as firmly as before, after a recent spate of sexual harassment allegations against politicians — and the reevaluation of past allegations — put Biden's handling of the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings back in the spotlight, Aaron Blake reported.\\n\\nAnd speaking of the #MeToo movement, the buzz around Oprah Winfrey after her campaign-style speech during the Golden Globes, confirmed that she would beat the president. According to the poll, she would get 52 percent of the vote to Trump's 39 percent. But 66 percent of respondents said electing a celebrity as president is a bad idea.\\n\\nOne particular lawmaker who is considered a front-runner by many liberals would not appear to have the support needed to beat Trump: Sanders. When asked whether they'd be inclined to vote for Sanders, 55 percent of those surveyed said no.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt has become a common argument on the left when lamenting Trump that had Sanders been the Democratic nominee over Hillary Clinton, he would have attracted enough support to beat Trump. The argument is that liberals who did not back Clinton would have voted for Sanders, along with some of the white working-class voters and men who ultimately chose Trump.\\n\\nHowever, this most recent poll suggests that may not be the case today. The poll also revealed potential support for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, the lawmaker from New York who holds Clinton's former seat in the Senate. When asked whether they would be inclined to vote for Gillibrand, 49 percent of Americans said no while only 13 percent said yes.\\n\\nGillibrand's name has been thrown around as a possible 2020 candidate and has attracted quite a bit of attention recently for public stances on sexual misconduct. She helped lead the call for former senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) to resign following allegations of sexual misconduct and even said former president Bill Clinton should have resigned, which sent shock waves through Democratic circles.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGillibrand has also spoken out in support of single-payer health care, a policy Sanders pushed during the 2016 campaign.\\n\\nThe survey did not poll Americans on other hypothetical 2020 candidates, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) or Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). But what is clear is that more than half of Americans seem uninterested in allowing Trump to remain in the White House for another term.\\n\\nIn a question in which no opponent is named, 62 percent of respondents said that they would not be inclined to vote for Trump; 34 percent said they would."}
{"original": "To do so, however, Trump may need the support not only of other political leaders but of the American public itself. Our research suggests that his ability to shape public opinion may be quite constrained. We find that Trump may be successful in mobilizing support among Republicans and some independents — but only for typical Republican policies. For policies that would change the 50 years of U.S. grand strategy, he will likely have difficulty changing public attitudes.\\n\\nHow we did our research\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the November election, we conducted an experiment involving more than 1,500 American adults whom we contacted through Qualtrics, a prominent market research firm. Our sample included an equal number of Democrats, Republicans and independents, as well as an equal number of men and women.\\n\\nIn the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to read different news stories about Republican candidates making statements about U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which has been a stable foundation of U.S. grand strategy.\\n\\nParticipants read news stories on one of three topics: criticizing the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran; supporting the development of nuclear weapons by Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia; and using nuclear weapons to destroy ISIS. The Iran deal story represents a typical Republican foreign policy position, while the other two stories advocate major changes to U.S. grand strategy. All three were positions that Trump took during the campaign.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHalf of the stories attributed the statements to Donald Trump, and the other half attributed the statements to Paul Evans, a fictional Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. We then asked participants their attitudes toward the Iran deal, the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT), and the principle of no first use of nuclear weapons.\\n\\nAttributing statements to Trump did not affect public attitudes any more than attributing them to the fictional Republican. Opposition to the NPT was essentially identical regardless of whether participants read about Trump or Evans supporting nuclear proliferation. Public opposition to the Iran deal was actually 5 percent higher when we attributed Trump's rhetoric to Evans. And public support for the first use of nuclear weapons was 6 percent higher when we attributed Trump's rhetoric to Evans. But these differences were small and likely due to chance variation.\\n\\nSo, if voters respond to Trump like a generic Republican, what does that mean for his ability to shape public support for a new foreign policy strategy? Our results suggest that Trump could rally Republicans and some independents to support typical Republican policy positions, like opposition to the Iran deal.\\n\\nRepublican opposition increased from 62 percent to 79 percent once they read Trump's critique. Among independents, opposition to the deal increased from 47 percent to 56 percent. There was no change among Democrats, unsurprisingly.\\n\\nBut participants were not persuaded by Trump's statements that are outside the typical boundaries of U.S. foreign policy. The next graph depicts the impact of the nuclear proliferation story on attitudes toward the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT) and the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons.\\n\\nReading the Trump statement advocating the spread of nuclear weapons has no impact on opposition to the NPT, regardless of whether it is attributed to Trump or Evans and regardless of the party affiliation of the reader. Indeed, reading Trump's statement actually lowers Republican opposition to the treaty slightly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUltimately, a large and bipartisan majority supports this non-proliferation treaty, and reading Trump's statement did not change that.\\n\\nThis same pattern holds regarding the use of nuclear weapons against ISIS. Once again, Trump's rhetoric did nothing to undermine popular support for the no first use policy regardless of whether the rhetoric was attributed to Trump or Evans, and regardless of the party affiliation of the reader.\\n\\nRepublican support for the first use of nuclear weapons is higher than among Democrats or independents, but it remains a minority position. Moreover, Republicans who oppose first use are unpersuaded by Trump's rhetoric. This was also true if we asked participants about using nuclear weapons against ISIS specifically.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump seeks a dramatic change in U.S. grand strategy, but sustaining policies that are unpopular will likely prove difficult over the long haul. Our experiment suggests that Trump will have difficulty persuading the American public to support many of his desired changes. Nuclear proliferation and the first use of nuclear weapons are not popular with Americans, and Trump's rhetoric appears — at least thus far — not to change anyone's minds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChristopher Gelpi is chair of peace studies and conflict resolution at the Mershon Center for International Security Studies and professor of political science at Ohio State University.

{"original": "While South Korea has run more than 35,000 coronavirus tests, the United States has tested only 426 people, not including people who returned on evacuation flights. Only about a dozen state and local laboratories can now run tests outside of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta because the CDC kits sent out nationwide earlier this month included a faulty component.\\n\\nU.S. guidelines recommend testing for a very narrow group of people — those who display respiratory symptoms and have recently traveled to China or had close contact with an infected person.\\n\\nThe covid-19 outbreak is negatively affecting Chinese businesses in New York and San Francisco, and some Chinese community members are feeling targeted. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nBut many public health experts think that in light of evidence that the disease has taken root and spread in Iran, Italy, Singapore and South Korea, it's time to broaden testing in the United States. Infectious disease experts fear that aside from the 14 cases picked up by public health surveillance, there may be other undetected cases mixed in with those of colds and flu. What scares experts the most is that the virus is beginning to spread in countries outside China, but no one knows whether that's the case in the United States, because they aren't checking.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCoronavirus testing kits have not been widely distributed to our hospitals and public health labs. Those without these kits must send samples all the way to Atlanta, rather than testing them on site, wasting precious time as the virus spreads, said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).\\n\\nIn a congressional hearing Tuesday, Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) pressed Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on whether the CDC test was faulty. He denied that the test did not work.\\n\\nBut in a news briefing that was going on about the same time, Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said that she was frustrated about problems with the test kits and that the CDC hoped to send out a new version to state and local health departments soon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think we are close, she said. She said that the agency is working as fast as possible on the tests, but that the priority is making sure they are accurate.\\n\\nCurrently, she said, a dozen state and local health departments can do the testing, although positive results need to be confirmed by the CDC. She also said she hoped that tests from commercial labs would soon come online.\\n\\nMessonnier said the agency was weighing widening its testing protocols to include people traveling to the United States from countries beyond mainland China, considering the rapid spread of the virus in other places in recent days.\\n\\nThe nation's public health laboratories, exasperated by the malfunctioning tests in the face of a global public health emergency, have taken the unusual step of appealing to the Food and Drug Administration for permission to develop and use their own tests. In Hawaii, authorities are so alarmed about the lack of testing ability that they requested permission from the CDC to use tests from Japan. A medical director at a hospital laboratory in Boston is developing an in-house test, but is frustrated that his laboratory won't be able to use it without going through an onerous and time-consuming review process, even if demand surges.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is an extraordinary request, but this is an extraordinary time, said Scott Becker, the chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which is asking the FDA for permission to allow the laboratories to create and implement their own laboratory-developed tests.\\n\\nAt one hospital in the Mid-Atlantic region, a patient who recently returned from Singapore, which has 90 cases, was admitted to the hospital with mild upper respiratory symptoms, according to a hospital official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the patient's privacy. The patient tested negative for flu. Because of underlying medical conditions, the person was at higher risk for severe illness if this was a coronavirus infection.\\n\\nEven though clinicians suspected coronavirus, and treated the person for it and placed the patient in isolation, the patient was not tested.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf this person had returned from mainland China, they would have been tested for coronavirus, the official said. The patient recovered and was discharged to their home.\\n\\nTesting also affects other aspects of care.\\n\\nPeople with confirmed cases can enroll in clinical trials for therapeutics. For patients who need more intense care in a facility with a biocontainment unit, that facility can receive reimbursement from the federal government for care, the official said.\\n\\nThe CDC announced a week and a half ago that it would add pilot coronavirus testing to its flu surveillance network in five cities, a step toward expanded testing of people with respiratory symptoms who didn't have other obvious risk factors. Specimens that test negative for flu will be tested for coronavirus. But that expanded testing has been delayed because of an unspecified problem with one of the compounds used in the CDC test. About half of state labs got inconclusive results when using the compound, so the CDC said it would make a new version and redistribute it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo public health experts, the delays — and lack of transparency about what, exactly, is wrong with the test — are extremely concerning.\\n\\nWe have over 700 flights every month between Hawaii and Japan or South Korea, where the virus is spreading in the community, said Hawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green (D), who is also an emergency physician. It's unlikely that the CDC would allow state labs to accept a test from another nation, he said, but this is an exceptional circumstance.\\n\\nIn a letter to the FDA, the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which represents state and local laboratories, asked the agency to use enforcement discretion to allow the laboratories to create and use their own laboratory-developed tests.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile we appreciate the many efforts underway at CDC to provide a diagnostic assay to our member labs … this has proven challenging and we find ourselves in a situation that requires a quicker local response, said the letter, which was co-signed by Becker. We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBecause a public health emergency has been declared, certified hospital laboratories that usually have the ability to internally develop and validate their own tests can't use them without applying for an emergency use authorization, a major barrier to deploying the test.\\n\\nI think a lot of people, myself included, think it's very likely this virus might be circulating at low levels in the United States right now. We can't know for sure because we haven't seen it, said Michael Mina, associate medical director of clinical microbiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He said the optimal testing scenario for flu is a 30-minute turnaround on a test, but right now, shipping samples to Atlanta to test for coronavirus means a 48-hour wait.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA lot of hospitals are trying to do something similar, which is get a test up and running on an instrument, get it validated in-house, Mina said. I think all of us are coming to the same realization that we can't do anything as long as this remains under the control of CDC and state labs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarion Koopmans, a virologist at the Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, which has performed a few hundred tests on behalf of more than a dozen countries, said that developing a test for a new pathogen is complicated and involves refinement and a back-and-forth between researchers who are constantly learning from one another.\\n\\nThat is typical for a new disease outbreak. No one actually knows how this works, so you really have to build these assays on the fly, Koopmans said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut as the United States struggled to ramp up its capacity, the coronavirus test was added to the sentinel flu surveillance system in the Netherlands two weeks ago. The test was recently rolled out to 12 high-performing molecular diagnostic laboratories in the Netherlands so that they can be ready to scale up if demand increases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPart of the problem in the still-struggling United States is the tension between regulations intended to ensure a high-quality standard for tests and the need to roll out diagnostic capabilities very quickly. No test is perfect, and with high stakes for missing or misidentifying a case, public health officials want to make sure that tests are as accurate as possible and are validated by labs that run them. But the slowness may also reflect years of underinvestment in public health infrastructure — and a bias toward developing treatments that may seem more appealing to the public.\\n\\nThe public health system is not sufficiently built to surge very rapidly, said Luciana Borio, the former director of Medical and Biodefense Preparedness Policy at the National Security Council and now a vice president at In-Q-Tel, a strategic investor that supports the U.S. intelligence community. Over the years, when given limited dollars, we applied it toward vaccines and therapeutics, more so than diagnostic tests. I think there's this idea: The diagnostic test is not going to save my life. But the fact is they underpin so much of the response and deserve a lot more attention."}
{"original": "The pilot feasibility study, a collaborative effort between a Harvard Medical School physician, the health insurer Anthem and IBM was designed to test whether employees and insurers would both benefit from putting more power in the hands of patients.\\n\\nTwo years later, it is defunct.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe short answer is nobody really used the tool, said Ateev Mehrotra, an associate professor of health-care policy and medicine at Harvard. For a variety of reasons, they just forgot about it. This is what I would say in my defense: I still think it's a good idea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe $3.3 trillion American health-care system is seen by most everyone as ripe for disruption. Its inefficiency and complexity are apparent to providers and patients alike — and consumer technology giants, such as Amazon and Apple, have made it clear they're interested in shaking things up.\\n\\nBut the tech companies that have excelled at disrupting industries, from bookstores to taxis, have typically done it by improving and transforming the consumer experience. Efforts to upend health care in the same way face a major challenge: Most consumers engage with the system infrequently and, when they do, patient choice tends to be superseded by health insurance plans and doctors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe first problem the app faced was simply getting people to download it. Emails and letters to 400 IBM employees offering a $20 gift card yielded just 30 sign-ups. The recruitment letter was tweaked and the bonus was upped to $50, but out of 700 letters sent out, only 60 people signed up. The second problem was getting people to use it. Although users told the Harvard research team that they thought the app had a good interface and functionality, it was out of sight and out of mind when they got sick.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMehrotra is the first to admit that he isn't an expert at developing killer apps — he's a professor and physician studying how innovation affects the cost and quality of care. A disappointing pilot at a single employer is by no means evidence that technology won't transform health care. But it is a reminder that this is a special sector of American life where consumer engagement has been puzzlingly hard.\\n\\nDerek Newell, president of the health tech company Castlight Health, compared being a patient in the traditional American health-care system to going to a restaurant with a rich uncle who pays, while the waiter chooses the food. The patient may get to pick the restaurant, but the rich uncle is the insurance company and the waiter is the doctor, who is motivated to keep bringing more entrees and expensive wine.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat system is changing. First, high-deductible health plans put consumers on the hook for their choices — effectively forcing consumers to pay for the first $5,000 of dinner with the rich uncle.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd the payment system is gradually shifting away from fee for service, or paying for each procedure. Instead, doctors and hospitals are increasingly paid for keeping people healthy — making costly procedures less attractive as a potential revenue stream.\\n\\nConsumer tools are proliferating to help people, but that has left the health-care landscape littered with digital walled gardens — Web portals where patients can access their medical records, insurance company websites with information about their plan, fitness apps where patients collect their own data. A person might find a doctor on one website but have to log in somewhere else to find out whether the physician is covered by their plan. People who search for their symptoms don't automatically get served information linked to their benefits, advising them on where they could go and how much it would cost.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe industry is trying to push people to become more consumer-centric. When you go out to dinner, you can be booking airfare — you go to Travelocity, you try to get a good deal. That hasn't been there in medicine, said Manish Oza, a regional vice president at Anthem. The challenge I think we see is when members are trying to make a decision. ... They don't say, 'I have a question or issue — let me go to Anthem.com.' \\n\\nCastlight has collaborated with Anthem to build an app called Engage, the next iteration in trying to solve this problem. The app provides transparency tools to empower customers to make informed choices and alerts them to gaps in care — such as if they're overdue for an important preventive test.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNewell said one of the biggest challenges his company has faced is getting the brand recognition so that people realize the app is a central place for health information. To increase people's engagement, Castlight has tied its app deeply into health plans and the person's specific benefits, giving people financial rewards for good health behavior. Members who receive cash bonuses for taking a certain number of steps or inputting blood glucose measurements a few times a week if they have diabetes can get a discount on their premium — while managing their disease better. At the same time, they become more familiar with the app.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo Newell, consumers can't upend the health-care system alone — change will come from employers and health plans that alter how the system pays for care. That, in turn, will empower consumers to make better choices and to utilize technology and monitoring tools that help them stay well.\\n\\nIt's a slow revolution, Newell said. Consumers drive change, but policy and benefit design and insurance drive more change in health care, more than anything. It's not a consumer market in the same way.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo far, tech companies have been focused far more on the tax rate, privacy and other issues that hit their industry directly, according to Dan Mendelson, president of Avalere Health, a consulting firm.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne thing I've found is that tech companies have not been present in the debate around reimbursement or payment and delivery reform, Mendelson said. If they put their muscle behind aligning the health-care system to make sure that tech is embraced in the health-care system, that would be very productive. It will happen when they decide it's of sufficient strategic importance.\\n\\nThat day may be coming soon. One of Mehrotra's takeaways from the feasibility study is that the information in the app would be more powerful if it were seamlessly integrated into a platform people use regularly. A website that people already use every day — say, Google or Amazon — that linked up with health insurance information and benefit design could be a powerful way to drive consumer behavior.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat if Alexa said, 'You haven't had your mammogram this year.' What if you said, 'I've got a sore throat; what are my options?'  Oza said, describing a possible vision of the future. It's something we're working on that we're trying to figure out."}

Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.\\n\\nTrump, however, touted his administration's antiabortion policies, including new orders on Thursday and Friday establishing an office to support medical professionals who do not want to perform abortions and making it easier for states to direct funding away from Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nMost leaders of the antiabortion movement don't blame Trump for what they perceive as a lack of progress; they fault Republicans in Congress for inaction.\\n\\nIt's because of the Senate. I put the blame with the Senate, Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life, said in an interview last week. I think that some of our members of Congress are afraid to be courageous on these issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThough Trump said Friday that Americans are more and more pro-life; you see that all the time, views on abortion have remained quite steady for decades. Since the mid-1990s, about half of citizens, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases.\\n\\nLast year, the March for Life fell just days after Trump's inauguration, and the tone was ebullient. Marchers believed they were heralding an administration that would prioritize limiting abortion. Mancini said then that she had four goals for policy in the president's first year in office: appointing an apparently antiabortion Supreme Court justice, defunding Planned Parenthood, codifying the annual Hyde Amendment that restricts federal money from funding abortions and passing a law banning abortion in many cases after 20 weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA year later, only the first of those four goals has been accomplished.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBills to make the Hyde Amendment permanent and to ban certain late-term abortions passed in the House but are unlikely to pass the Senate. Both chambers of Congress tried to defund Planned Parenthood in their unsuccessful efforts to pass a health-care bill.\\n\\nEven abortion rights supporters are surprised that antiabortion policies haven't made more headway in the past year.\\n\\nI think it goes to show how the Republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways, said Heather Boonstra, director of public policy at the Guttmacher Institute.\\n\\nThe White House has advanced several policies through executive orders rather than legislation, starting with an expanded version of the Bush-era Mexico City policy, which bars U.S. funding to public health organizations that promote abortion overseas and which Trump reinstated upon taking office. On Thursday, the day before the march, Trump announced another policy that pleased antiabortion activists — a new office meant to protect the rights of medical professionals who don't want to participate in abortions because of their religious beliefs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn his speech Friday, Trump noted those actions, and boasted about the stock market and unemployment rates as well. He called to the podium a mother who became pregnant at 17 and later went on to help establish a facility to support homeless pregnant women.\\n\\nTrump repeated a claim he made during a presidential debate against Hillary Clinton in 2016 — that a fetus in a number of states can be aborted in the ninth month.\\n\\nIt is wrong. It has to change, he said about those late-term abortions. As the Post's Fact Checker pointed out in 2016, 89 percent of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks and only 1.2 percent occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Guttmacher Institute. All but seven states prohibit some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy, making ninth month abortions exceptionally rare and largely banned already.\\n\\nVice President Pence mentioned the Roe v. Wade anniversary, saying, Forty-five years ago, the Supreme Court turned its back on the inalienable right to life. But in that moment, our movement began. He praised Trump as the most pro-life president in American history and vowed, With God's help, we will restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the marchers' noon rally east of the Washington Monument, the White House satellite appearance was part of a slate of speakers, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.).\\n\\nThe crowd gave him rock star treatment, with whoops and applause. How grateful are we to have a pro-life president back in the White House! Ryan said.\\n\\nOne thing that gets lost is how compassionate the pro-life movement is, he said. To help women who have gone through the pain of abortion, to help single mothers, to give them resources through thousands of pregnancy centers: This is the face of the pro-life movement.\\n\\nAhead of the march, antiabortion groups around the region hosted events on Friday morning – huge youth Masses full of screaming teenagers, a meeting on legal strategies to limit abortion and a conference in the basement of a downtown hotel where the emphasis was on expanding the idea of pro-life.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHundreds of people at the Evangelicals for Life conference wandered booths about prison ministries and health care and heard speakers talk about the importance of adoption and serving refugees.\\n\\nPopular evangelical author and speaker Ann Voskamp talked to a crowd of largely young white listeners about a robust pro-life ethic. … We are for both humans in utero and humans in crisis. This is us.\\n\\nThe message echoed a talk on Capitol Hill Thursday, in which the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, one of Trump's evangelical advisers, stood with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urging Congress to protect undocumented young adults. Noting that the March for Life would be the next day, Rodriguez said the two topics were linked as life issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJessica Ponce, 26, marched at the very front of the pack with fellow parishioners from the Archdiocese of Mobile, Ala. She said the experience is poignant because she just learned she is pregnant. A native Mexican who is now a permanent resident in the United States, she said that to her, pro-life means taking care of all human beings, including immigrants and refugees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's not possible to care for people if you are separating families, and parents cannot defend the lives of their children if they are not able to stay together, she said.\\n\\nIn an effort to make the same point, a group of Franciscan priests stood near the front of the stage during the rally. When Trump appeared on the screen, they raised banners saying: Keeping families together is pro-life! Keep God's dream alive!\\n\\nI'm here to stand for the integrity of my faith and of the gospel. I'm not willing to sacrifice that for political expediency, said the Rev. Jacek Orzechowski, a community organizer with Catholic Charities of Washington. For someone to say they're pro-life but display callous policies that tear families apart is reprehensible.\\n\\nA Catholic priest from New York City said some in his parish – a heavily Central American congregation that includes many undocumented immigrants – didn't come to Washington out of fear. The priest, who said he was afraid to use his name, still praised Trump's talk at the rally. We put our faith in no man. Our faith is in Jesus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAbout 50 demonstrators staged their own rally outside the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum rather than joining the main rally on the Mall, to protest Trump's address. They said their belief that life begins at conception comes from scientific research on fetal development, not from faith. They brought I am a pro-life feminist signs that they hoped would indicate that the antiabortion movement is not just a bunch of priests, as Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa put it.\\n\\nLet's put some secular, pro-life, bad-ass feminists up front, she said.\\n\\nMany leaders of the movement, though, publicly embrace Trump to greater or lesser extent. Mancini said she thinks the marchers, most of them young because of the prevalence of school groups in attendance, telegraphed a message of support to the president. For Trump, hopefully, he feels thanked and strengthened for his perspective, she said.\\n\\nSarah Pulliam Bailey contributed to this report. This post has been updated."}

{"original": "AD\\n\\nThe first visit to a primary state by a top-tier Democratic presidential candidate found a candidate still honing her stump speech, with a well-oiled campaign infrastructure and audiences that were still in the tire-kicking phase. It revealed plenty about how Warren, who has been urged to run for president since at least 2013, would approach a real campaign. The caricature of Warren — by mid-December, she was being covered as a flawed and stumbling liberal who had missed her best shot to run for president — did not survive intact. Here's what replaced it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe's not focused on Donald Trump. In 2016, as the primaries were winding down, Warren began attacking Trump on Twitter, branding him a xenophobic bully as he fired back with attacks on her claim of Native American heritage. At the time, Democrats insisted the senator was cracking a code. She's showing that the best way to respond is to punch back hard and to call him out, former Obama spokesman Tommy Vietor told the New York Times.\\n\\nBut Trump won the election, and ever since his insults have been perceived, by the press, as masterful distractions that no Democrat can effectively rebut. Since her DNA test, Warren has simply stopped responding to Trump's insults; over four Iowa events, she mentioned the president's name only once, when asked about the aforementioned test, saying that she simply could not stop him from hurling racial slurs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has become the silence between the notes of Warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy. When Warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the million dollars a day that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. It's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren also emphasized her lower-profile Senate work to demonstrate that she was more than a left-wing candidate. In Sioux City, she talked about her effort to pass legislation lowering the price of hearing aids.\\n\\nI talked to a lot of people about what would it take to do this, and then I called Chuck Grassley, she said. After some boos at the name of Iowa's senior Republican senator subsided, Warren said she'd called another Republican and another Republican and another Republican, done all this all under the radar screen, put no hard lines on it, and [wrote] a bill. It's not the most dramatic story, but it tells Iowan more about Warren than they knew before she flew in\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe is not Bernie Sanders. Plenty of the Democrats who wanted to draft Warren into the 2016 race went on to support the Vermont senator; a good number of those strategists, activists and voters now support him even with Warren in the race. But Warren's approach to campaigning could not be more different. The Sanders approach, which has not changed in decades, is to sketch out a social democratic vision of America — universal health care, free public college tuition, a $15 minimum wage — in sentences punctuated by applause. He mentions his biography only to talk about how he proved skeptics wrong as mayor of Burlington. Voters who show up to hear Sanders hear the message, and then they decide whether they're in.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren's stump speech begins with a little bit about who I am, with a story that quiets down the crowd: about the night she heard her mother muttering, We will NOT lose this house as she contemplated how to deal with her father's medical bills. She moves on to a vision of changing the rules of three sectors of society: the economy, government and politics.\\n\\nIn that litany, anti-corruption legislation is filed under government; voting rights, including a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to vote, is filed under politics. It's more incremental than the Sanders approach, but it grows out of a rationale for running, the sort of thing Democrats believe Hillary Clinton never was able to do. Warren, who has been accused of elitism (by Republicans) since entering politics, connects every policy position to her identity and the years she spent (to use a phrase she's dropped) on the ragged edge of the middle class.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren is one of five senators with presidential ambitions who has co-sponsored the Medicare for All Act; she is also the first of them to announce a campaign or exploratory committee. Yet at her first four events, the Massachusetts senator did not mention the legislation at all. Only in Des Moines did she say something that emphasized her support for universal care: Health care is a human right.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter the Sioux City event, I asked Warren if there was a reason she wasn't mentioning Medicare-for-all in the stump speech. No, no special reason, she said. No one's raised it. But I have had a chance to talk about Medicaid. Partly because I think we've had a national conversation about health care, and I think it's been enormously valuable. It's obviously about how we protect ourselves and each other. But it's also about our values. I hope we continue to have that conversation. I will continue to talk about health care every chance I get.\\n\\nContrast that with Sanders, who never lets a speech end without talking up Medicare-for-all. Contrast it with what the bill's other sponsors might do when they get to Iowa and work to distinguish themselves.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe has a fan base, and she takes care of it. At every Warren stop, but especially in Des Moines, it was easy to spot merchandise and tokens of support that predated her trip to Iowa. Shirts reading Nevertheless, she persisted, references to the 2017 moment when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prevented Warren from negatively referring to Attorney General-designate Jeff Sessions, were everywhere.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA 2014 Run, Warren, Run, sign, printed by MoveOn, was unfolded in Storm Lake. A shirt from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee's 2012 ad campaign, I'm from the Elizabeth Warren Wing of the Democratic Party, was visible at three of the stops. In Council Bluffs, a Teamster named Bob Payne briefly pulled Warren aside to ask if she'd gotten a shirt he'd sent her office, to advertise a pension reform bill the union supported.\\n\\nI got it and I wore it! Warren said, hugging Payne — who called her my hero for working on pensions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt was also easy to find Democrats who had wanted Warren to run before and were still shopping for a candidate but had an emotional connection to her.\\n\\nFrom the moment of 'nevertheless, she persisted,' I got the mug on my desk, said Julie Brown, a 55-year-old businesswoman who brought her daughter to see Warren in Des Moines. I've got a pen that says it. It was a rallying call for women, in particular. When you live that, when this happens to you on a daily basis, and you have a strong wonderful woman who shuts it down — it's very inspiring.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA lot of that could change as candidates pile into the race, but Warren's campaign, at the moment, is taking full advantage of the pent-up interest. At every stop, she has stopped to take pictures with anyone willing to wait for one; her team has grabbed copies of her books (or even photographs and baseballs, which sometimes are passed around by autograph hunters) and returned them to voters, signed. It's more like the approach Clinton's campaign took in 2016, and Sen. Cory Booker's pre-campaign is taking now, than what fans of Sanders found last cycle.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBoth Booker and Sanders, of course, had been to Iowa more recently than Warren had. Both, if they run, will get their chance to introduce themselves to voters who don't see a clear favorite right now. But Warren's visit, coming after a long stretch of skeptical coverage, set a higher bar than many expected.\\n\\nAD WATCH\\n\\nThe president's reelection campaign is running new digital ads on immigration; I saw one of them as a YouTube pre-roll while in Iowa this weekend. In it, footage of crime — and of the White House meeting where the president said he'd own any shutdown — play over a number that voters can text to get campaign updates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer care more about the radical left than keeping us safe, a narrator says. The consequences? Drug deaths. Violent murder. Gang violence. We must not allow it. That's followed by Trump himself saying that liberals care more about illegal immigrants than Americans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2020\\n\\nJay Inslee. The governor of Washington has created a special expedited process to clear the records of people convicted of marijuana possession before voters legalized it. He's also being pilloried by Ray Buckley, the chairman of New Hampshire's Democratic Party, for not helping New Hampshire's 2018 gubernatorial nominee more; Inslee was last cycle's chairman of the Democratic Governors Association.\\n\\nJulián Castro. He's in Iowa this week, ahead of an expected presidential announcement; after that, he'll head back out. He appeared on ABC's This Week on Sunday, pitching himself as a candidate for the 21st century who'd run one of United States' most diverse cities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJohn Delaney. He's opening the first 2020 campaign offices of any Democratic candidate for president — one in Des Moines, one in Cedar Rapids, both on Saturday.\\n\\nEVERYBODY IS WRONG\\n\\nThe controversy over remarks by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) at a MoveOn reception this week seems to be winding down, but not before inspiring head-scratching theories about the political impact.\\n\\nTlaib, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, ran as an implacable opponent of the president who had once been hauled out of an event for protesting him. Her district, which for a half-century was represented by John Conyers, gave Trump just 18.1 percent of the vote. For Tlaib herself, the political impact of saying that she wants the president impeached and removed from office was at worst a wash; at best, it's going to earn her votes.\\n\\nWhat's confusing is the speculation that Tlaib will hurt her party politically. True, the House Democratic majority, and the leaders of the relevant committees, have no plan to impeach the president until and unless Republicans believe it's necessary. They've said it many times. To the extent Tlaib forced them to say it again, they had a bad news cycle.\\n\\nBut how will any of this cost them votes? The Tlaib controversy is what I like to call a Red Hen event — a brief source of outrage that is pored over for political impact but it too far from an election to have any. Think of the moments in 2017 and 2018 that were, according to Republicans (and some neutral analysts), going to focus the electorate on the new radicalism of the Democratic Party.\\n\\nProtests of Trump administration officials as they ate dinner.\\n\\nClashes between antifa and right-wing protesters.\\n\\nMichelle Wolf's routine at the White House Correspondents' Dinner.\\n\\nKathy Griffin's photo shoot with a decapitated Trump.\\n\\nAnd the most relevant example was the rhetoric of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.). In early 2017, she said Democrats needed to impeach the president and stop his a--. In the summer of 2018, she was filmed encouraging protesters to push back on Trump Cabinet officials and tell them they're not welcome. That kicked off a multi-day news cycle, with speculation about Waters, whom the president personally attacks on Twitter and at rallies, disrupting the Democratic message.\\n\\nSome events, and some gaffes, do change the national conversation. But few do so while affecting the individual fortunes of politicians. Nearly every Democrat asked about Tlaib this week had the same response: They did not like the language, and they would prefer that any impeachment talk be shelved until after investigations did or didn't turn up impeachable offenses.\\n\\nI think it is absolutely essentially that we protect the Mueller investigation, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in Iowa this weekend after being asked about Tlaib. The special prosecutor has already produced more than two dozen indictments or guilty pleas. Our job right now in Congress is to protect that investigation, and we need bipartisan legislation to do that. Mueller needs to complete his investigation and make a full report to the American people.\\n\\nRepublicans have been predicting a Democratic crack-up on impeachment for nearly the entirety of the Trump presidency, and it simply hasn't happened. In 2018, as the president of the House GOP's super PAC, strategist Corry Bliss repeatedly speculated that the angry Democratic base would nominate impeachment-obsessed candidates, who would alienate swing voters.\\n\\nThe crowded, nasty, divisive primaries going on around the country [are] going to produce nominees who are to the left of Bernie Sanders and want to do nothing but impeach the president, Bliss said confidently in a May 2018 interview.\\n\\nBut with the exception of Beto O'Rourke, Democrats in swing races evaded the impeachment issue; they gave the sort of wait for Mueller' answers that Warren gave this weekend in Iowa. And the impeachment issue was more potentially potent in the midterms than it can possibly be in 2020. Either the House will impeach the president, or it won't; if it does, it will be as the first step in a process that Republicans get behind, in the sort of drama that is unthinkable right now. If it doesn't, the president will be on the ballot in 22 months, making the question completely irrelevant.\\n\\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\\n\\nEating the rich. An under-noticed moment from Julián Castro's ABC News interview came when he was asked if he agreed with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on taxes. She suggested, in a 60 Minutes interview, that high marginal tax rates were not so radical, as they'd been well above 50 percent in the past. Did Castro agree?\\n\\n(Marginal tax rates are simple — currently if you fall into the top bracket, you pay that top 35 percent rate only on income over $416,000.)\\n\\nI can support folks at the top paying for fair share, said Castro, former San Antonio mayor and HUD secretary. As you know, George, there was a time in this country where the top marginal tax rate was over 90 percent; even during Reagan's era in the 1980s it was around 50 percent.\\n\\nSo do I support, in order to have something like Medicare-for-all, that we ask folks that are in the top 0.05 percent or 0.5 percent or top 1 percent to pay more? he asked rhetorically.\\n\\nSince 1992, Democrats have run elections on a twin promise of cutting middle class taxes while making the rich pay their fair share. But since the passage of the 2017 tax cuts, there's a palpable willingness among Democrats to talk about restoring higher taxes on the very wealthy, and perhaps even returning to rates abandoned decades ago. In Iowa, Warren suggested restoring the 50 percent estate tax on the very highest incomes, so that it would affect perhaps only the 10,000 wealthiest families in the country.\\n\\nThere are Democrats looking at 2020 who will utterly reject that. But keep an eye on the Democrats who see this as a starting point for a new debate.\\n\\nREADING LIST\\n\\nA look at some of the same Warren rhetoric mentioned above, and how the senator harks back to a pre-Reagan regulatory era as a time when the country was, while not perfect, a little greater.\\n\\nAn origin story about Warren's first connections with the online left, and liberals.

{"original": "AD\\n\\nTen years ago, people were saying that noise is just annoying, but now I think there's considerable evidence that noise makes you sick, and one of the predominate diseases is cardiovascular disease, lead author Thomas Münzel said Tuesday in a phone interview with The Washington Post.\\n\\nThe research does not prove that loud noises cause heart disease. But Münzel, with the cardiology center at the University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, told ABC News that noise pollution — or unwanted environmental noise — is a risk factor for heart disease in the same way that high cholesterol and obesity may increase the odds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose confronted with noise pollution, which causes disturbances to communication during the day and sleep at night, may have increased stress hormone levels, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOver time, Münzel said, it can take a toll on the body — increasing cholesterol, blood pressure and heart rate. If this persists for years, then you have a risk of coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure and arrhythmia, he told The Post.\\n\\nMünzel added that long-term noise pollution may also be linked to depression and anxiety disorders as well as problems with cognitive development in young children.\\n\\nBut in researching the link between noise pollution and heart disease, experts warn that there are also factors that can complicate the findings. For instance, people who live in heavily populated areas more likely to be plagued by noise are also exposed to more particle pollution in the air, which can also cause heart problems. And, people who live in such areas may also have a different socioeconomic status, meaning they may not have the same access to health care or healthful foods.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, said Steve Kopecky, a professor of medicine specializing in cardiovascular diseases at the Mayo Clinic, noise and how it affects health is something to consider.\\n\\nI think it's something we need to pay more attention to in terms of our everyday living, he told The Post.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization calls noise pollution an underestimated threat that can cause sleep disturbance, cardiovascular effects, poorer work and school performance, hearing impairment.\\n\\nThe agency has published guidelines for community noise (PDF), recommending 30 A-weighted decibels in the bedroom for a good night's sleep.\\n\\nA car measures 70 decibels, a jackhammer 100 decibels and an airplane takeoff 120 decibels, according to a WHO decibel scale cited by ABC News. Though there is no set threshold to establish risk, we do know that anything above 60 decibels can increase risk for heart disease, Münzel told the station.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe need more research to determine what duration of exposure to loud noise is harmful, but we do know that the risk comes from years and years of exposure, not days, he added.\\n\\nExperts say that loud noises, especially when people are not expecting them, can trigger the stress response.\\n\\nHow does it work?\\n\\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, when a person senses a threat, your hypothalamus, a tiny region at the base of your brain, sets off an alarm system in your body.\\n\\nThrough a combination of nerve and hormonal signals, this system prompts your adrenal glands, located atop your kidneys, to release a surge of hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol. Adrenaline increases your heart rate, elevates your blood pressure and boosts energy supplies. Cortisol, the primary stress hormone, increases sugars (glucose) in the bloodstream, enhances your brain's use of glucose and increases the availability of substances that repair tissues. Cortisol also curbs functions that would be nonessential or detrimental in a fight-or-flight situation. It alters immune system responses and suppresses the digestive system, the reproductive system and growth processes. This complex natural alarm system also communicates with regions of your brain that control mood, motivation and fear.\\n\\nKopecky said people may not pay attention to certain sounds when they expect them — such as hearing horns honk while sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic — but that same sound when it's unexpected — such as when a person is asleep — can trigger the stress response.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKopecky said there are several ways that response can lead to damage: The rush of hormones causes the arteries to constrict, which can damage the lining of the arteries and lead to heart disease. It can also raise blood pressure or make the blood more likely to clot, which is a problem with heart attacks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut regardless of where a person lives, Kopecky said, there are things that can be done, especially when it comes to sleep, such as using a white noise machine to help drown out unwanted sounds.\\n\\nMünzel is calling on lawmakers to change policies.\\n\\nNoise can be considered a cardiovascular risk factor, he said. Importantly, this is a risk factor that cannot be managed by patients or by doctors; it just can be managed by politicians by making laws with low thresholds for decibel levels during the day and during the night to protect the people living very close to noise sources.\\n\\nThis report has been updated."}

Instead, Perdue has attacked Ossoff over the Green New Deal, calling it a piece of Democrats' leftist, radical, socialist agenda during an appearance last week on Fox News.\\n\\nSimilarly, an ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee claims Ossoff praises AOC's radical Green New Deal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPresident Trump similarly needled Biden over the Green New Deal during the presidential election, despite the Democratic candidate's rejection of the plan.\\n\\nOssoff has been clear in opposing the resolution.\\n\\nBut Ossoff commended its sponsors for linking environmental policy and infrastructure policy, as he told the New York Times in October.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Green New Deal is a broad, nonbinding resolution put forward two years ago by Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal lawmakers to cut U.S. contributions to climate change in just 10 years. Biden and top House Democrats are instead aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\\n\\nLike the former vice president, both Ossoff and Warnock call for reentering the Paris climate agreement and undoing the repeal of Barack Obama-era regulations as part of a clean energy transition. Both neither endorses the Green New Deal by name on their websites, nor have they committed that aggressive 10-year timeline for decarbonization.\\n\\nThere is a lot at stake in the Georgia runoffs.\\n\\nControl of the Senate is up for grabs after voting ends Tuesday. If both Ossoff and Warnock win, Democrats would force a 50-50 tie in the Senate. Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris would serve as the tiebreaker, handing control to Schumer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe results Tuesday will help determine the extent to which Biden will be able to enact his $2 trillion plan for reducing emissions from the power and auto sectors.

These nets, used to catch thresher sharks and swordfish, often entangle other marine life, including whales, dolphins and sea lions, and are already prohibited in U.S. waters off the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. In 2018, California passed a four-year phaseout of the nets in state waters.\\n\\nTrump claimed in his veto message on Friday that the legislation would cause Americans to import more foreign seafood and worsen a multibillion-dollar seafood trade deficit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said more whales, dolphins, sea turtles and other marine species will be needlessly killed. She pledged to reintroduce the bill during the new Congress and push for quick enactment once President Biden is in office.\\n\\nA court will consider a request to stop the Trump administration's Arctic oil lease sale.\\n\\nU.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage will hear oral arguments today in a case brought by the National Audubon Society and other environmental groups attempting to halt the sale of oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The case is one of four lawsuits brought by environmental groups, tribal organizations and 15 state governments challenging the Bureau of Land Management's plan to open bids this week, the Anchorage Daily News reports.\\n\\nMany major banks have ruled out financing for Arctic oil exploration, and it is unclear how much interest the lease sale will attract. In a highly unusual step, a state of Alaska-owned corporation could be among the bidders in an effort to acquire and hold leases for possible future development by oil companies, during what's considered a challenging time for investment in Arctic oil projects, the Anchorage Daily News writes.\\n\\nA video of a National Park Service ranger using a Taser on a Native American man sparked an investigation.\\n\\nThe National Park Service opened an investigation after Darrell House uploaded a video showing a National Park Service ranger repeatedly using a Taser on him in the Petroglyph National Monument, our colleague Andrea Salcedo reports.

I almost laugh out loud when I hear Democrats saying things like, Jesus said suffer the little children to come unto me and try to use that as the reason we should open up our borders.\\n\\nIt's such a distortion of the teachings of Jesus to say that what he taught us to do personally — to love our neighbors as ourselves, help the poor — can somehow be imputed on a nation. Jesus never told Caesar how to run Rome. He went out of his way to say that's the earthly kingdom, I'm about the heavenly kingdom and I'm here to teach you how to treat others, how to help others, but when it comes to serving your country, you render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. It's a distortion of the teaching of Christ to say Jesus taught love and forgiveness and therefore the United States as a nation should be loving and forgiving, and just hand over everything we have to every other part of the world. That's not what Jesus taught. You almost have to believe that this is a theocracy to think that way, to think that public policy should be dictated by the teachings of Jesus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJerry Falwell Jr., president of conservative Liberty University, praised Donald Trump's conservative credentials at the Republican National Convention in 2016. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo, the government you want is one free of religious association?\\n\\nYes. The government should be led by somebody who is going to do what's in the best interest of the government and its people. And I believe that's what Jesus thought, too.\\n\\nIn 2016 you wrote in a Washington Post editorial that voters in the 2010 and 2014 midterms sent a message they were tired of the leftist agenda. What message did voters in the 2018 midterms send?\\n\\nThis midterm, the president did better than the average president does in his first midterms. So I think the message is that the American people are happy with the direction the country is headed and happy with the economy, happy with our newfound respect in the world. It's a better result than you normally see in the first midterms.\\n\\nYou pushed for national leaders to use the term radical Islamic terrorism when describing Muslims who are terrorists. Should leaders call it white supremacist terrorism when we have violent acts by white supremacists in this country?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSure, if a terrorist is someone who is trying to overthrow a political regime. I guess it depends on what your definition of terrorism is. Anybody who kills anybody else or commits violence against anybody else because of their race is horrible. It's just as bad as the 9/11 attack.\\n\\nYou and other white evangelical leaders have strongly supported President Trump. What about him exemplifies Christianity and earns him your support?\\n\\nWhat earns him my support is his business acumen. Our country was so deep in debt and so mismanaged by career politicians that we needed someone who was not a career politician, but someone who'd been successful in business to run the country like a business. That's the reason I supported him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe deficit and debt have increased during his first two years.\\n\\nYeah, Congress, the spending bill that they forced on him in order to get the military spending up to where it needed to be — he said that would be the last time he signed one of those. But he had no choice because Obama had decimated the military, and it had to be rebuilt.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIs there anything President Trump could do that would endanger that support from you or other evangelical leaders?\\n\\nNo.\\n\\nThat's the shortest answer we've had so far.\\n\\nOnly because I know that he only wants what's best for this country, and I know anything he does, it may not be ideologically conservative, but it's going to be what's best for this country, and I can't imagine him doing anything that's not good for the country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIs it hypocritical for evangelical leaders to support a leader who has advocated violence and who has committed adultery and lies often? I understand that a person can be forgiven their sins, but should that person be leading the country?\\n\\nWhen Jesus said we're all sinners, he really meant all of us, everybody. I don't think you can choose a president based on their personal behavior because even if you choose the one that you think is the most decent — let's say you decide Mitt Romney. Nobody could be a more decent human being, better family man. But there might be things that he's done that we just don't know about. So you don't choose a president based on how good they are; you choose a president based on what their policies are. That's why I don't think it's hypocritical.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's two kingdoms. There's the earthly kingdom and the heavenly kingdom. In the heavenly kingdom the responsibility is to treat others as you'd like to be treated. In the earthly kingdom, the responsibility is to choose leaders who will do what's best for your country. Think about it. Why have Americans been able to do more to help people in need around the world than any other country in history? It's because of free enterprise, freedom, ingenuity, entrepreneurism and wealth. A poor person never gave anyone a job. A poor person never gave anybody charity, not of any real volume. It's just common sense to me.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou've been criticized by some other evangelical leaders about your support for the president. They say you need to demand higher moral and ethical standards. You disagree with them on that?\\n\\nIt may be immoral for them not to support him, because he's got African American employment to record highs, Hispanic employment to record highs. They need to look at what the president did for the poor. A lot of the people who criticized me, because they had a hard time stomaching supporting someone who owned casinos and strip clubs or whatever, a lot them have come around and said, Yeah, you were right. Some of the most prominent evangelicals in the country have said, Jerry, we thought you were crazy, but now we understand."}
{"original": "ON THE MOST explosive and morally subversive challenge facing the Roman Catholic Church — clerical sexual abuse of children, and the bishops who tolerate it — Pope Francis has said the right things but done too little. Even now, 15 years after the explosive revelations of church complicity in enabling and covering up the predations of American priests who damaged so many young lives, not a single bishop has been explicitly held accountable and stripped of his title.\\n\\nThe pope's sluggish, inadequate and compromised stance in the face of this outrage is the subject of a new book, Lust, by a respected Italian journalist, Emiliano Fittipaldi. The book, published last week, is an indictment not just of a papal policy that has failed to live up to its ringing promises about zero tolerance for clerical sexual abuse, but of Francis's papacy.\\n\\nMr. Fittipaldi reveals that the pace of complaints about sexual abuse filed with the Holy See has been virtually unchanged in the nearly four years since Francis became pope, compared with his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who was deservedly condemned for his inaction. More damningly, the book details repeated instances where church officials implicated in allegations of abuse and coverups were promoted, often to top positions in the church's sprawling hierarchy.\\n\\nOne example is Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz, former archbishop of Santiago, Chile, elevated by Francis to the elite, nine-member Council of Cardinal Advisers, a sort of papal kitchen cabinet in Rome. Errázuriz has long been accused of ignoring accusations of sexual abuse against a priest under his jurisdiction. Another is Cardinal George Pell, formerly an Australian bishop, who serves as the Vatican's top finance official. He has long been accused of having shrugged off pedophilia among priests during his time in Australia. When questioned about it last year by an investigative commission in his home country, he fell back on the old canard about the church being no better or worse than society at large, a facile formulation often used by Vatican officials to avoid any admission of the church's ingrained pattern of institutional complicity.\\n\\nThe pope himself has made some strong statements about clergy sex abuse and taken a few symbolic steps to underscore his compassion for victims, in one case meeting with victims of sexually abusive priests in Philadelphia. But his deeds to establish real accountability have been hollow. He tried and failed to establish a special tribunal to hold negligent bishops accountable, then issued a decree saying it was unnecessary since the Vatican already was empowered to remove them from office if they turned a blind eye to sex abuse in their dioceses.\\n\\nNow, seven months later, there is little indication that bishops, the church's princelings, are truly being held to account. Without that, the pope's words are like puffs of smoke."}

She was 58.\\n\\nThe cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her husband, David Battey.\\n\\nMs. Ozer, who lived in Washington, joined the National Family Farm Coalition soon after its founding in 1986 and had been executive director for the past 24 years.\\n\\nThe coalition, which encompasses 25 organizations nationally, works on policy initiatives to support fair prices for small farmers and to protect their land from predatory buyers.\\n\\nMs. Ozer helped draft and promote the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, which was passed by Congress in the wake of a severe economic downturn that drove thousands of farmers off the land. It helped many more beleaguered farmers, threatened with the loss of their livelihoods, to renegotiate terms of their loans.\\n\\nFamily farmers in this country had no better advocate in D.C. than Kathy Ozer, said Lorette Picciano, executive director of Rural Coalition, who worked alongside Ms. Ozer on a variety of issues. She was quite a force who worked behind the scenes with very little credit, but she connected all the groups.\\n\\nMs. Ozer was a liaison to dozens of agriculture-related organizations in the United States and abroad, including Farm Aid, which features celebrity-studded concerts to raise funds for family farmers. She also worked on early efforts to promote sustainable agriculture and country-of-origin labels on food and argued against introducing genetically modified foods to the public.\\n\\nIn the 1990s, Ms. Ozer unsuccessfully lobbied members of Congress to reject the North American Free Trade Agreement, arguing that it would hurt farmers in the United States and Mexico. The issue of NAFTA's fairness became a major topic in the 2016 presidential campaign.\\n\\nIn recent years, Ms. Ozer fought to gain sustained funding for the Agriculture Department's Grain Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration, which is designed to help small farmers receive fair payment from giant poultry and meat companies.\\n\\nShe pushed some of the most difficult challenges facing rural America, Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) said in an interview. She fought for decades. I'm the longest-serving woman in Congress, and I have met thousands of people.

{"original": "Mark Morgan, the acting CBP commissioner, told reporters at a White House briefing that more than 52,000 migrants were taken into custody in September at U.S. ports of entry and between them, a decline of 18 percent from August.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOverall, U.S. border authorities made 977,509 arrests during fiscal 2019, up 88 percent from last year and the highest total since 2007. Morgan called it a staggering increase.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese are numbers no immigration system in the world is designed to handle, he said.\\n\\nArrests by U.S. border agents reached an all-time high of 1.6 million in 2000, but Department of Homeland Security officials insist that the migration wave they faced this year is unlike anything in the past.\\n\\nA generation ago, most of the migrants crossing the border illegally were single adults from Mexico who could be quickly processed and deported.\\n\\nThis year, Central American parents with children made up the overwhelming majority of border crossers. Instead of seeking to evade capture, many sought out U.S. agents to surrender and stated a fear of being sent home, the first step in seeking asylum or another form of legal protection in the United States.\\n\\nCourt limits on the amount of time minors can be held in CBP custody mean that nearly any parent who arrived with a child could expect to be issued a notice to appear in court and to be released into the U.S. interior within a few days.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHomeland security officials said smuggling organizations have been exploiting this loophole, reaping huge profits by marketing an easy trip north.\\n\\nThe surge reached its height in May, when more than 144,000 were taken into custody, including one group of 1,036 that crossed the border into El Paso to surrender.\\n\\nAfter that event, President Trump demanded a crackdown, threatening to impose tariffs on Mexican imports if Mexican authorities did not help stem the tide.\\n\\nThe government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador responded by deploying thousands of national guard troops to clamp down on the Central American migrants, while also allowing the United States to expand a program that requires migrants to wait outside U.S. territory while their legal claims are processed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder that program, which the Trump administration calls the Migrant Protection Protocols, nearly 50,000 migrants have been returned to Mexico, many of them waiting months in dangerous border cities. Trump officials say the program has been effective at deterring migrants who might be trying to game the system with baseless asylum claims.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe legality of the MPP is being challenged in federal courts — an appeals court allowed it to continue temporarily while weighing it — as is a new policy that disqualifies asylum seekers who do not attempt to gain protection in other nations while en route to the U.S. border.\\n\\nMorgan said that asylum bar would be implemented this week, following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last month that allowed the administration to go forward while legal challenges are pending in federal courts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAdvocates for migrants say the Trump administration has all but slammed the door on migrants fleeing violence and persecution, exposing children and other vulnerable populations to grave risks.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Morgan said: The administration's efforts — they're working. Four short months ago, our daily apprehensions were close to 5,000. And today . . . it's below 1,700.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMorgan said that the figure remained too high and that a more manageable level would be 500 apprehensions per day. The 52,546 enforcement actions CBP tallied in September still rank it higher than any single month during the 2018 fiscal year.\\n\\nBut compared with the rest of fiscal 2019, it was the lowest monthly total and a 65 percent drop from the May peak, Morgan noted. He said the agency had essentially ended catch-and-release, the term Trump administration officials use to refer to the practice of releasing border crossers from detention with a notice to appear in court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf you come to our borders with a child, it's no longer an immediate passport into the interior of the United States, he said.\\n\\nIn another crucial indicator of the change in volume, Morgan said the number of migrants in CBP custody is approximately 4,000, down from 19,000 in early June, when cells were overflowing with families and children in squalid conditions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMorgan also told reporters that the administration has completed 71 of the 450 miles of beautiful new border barriers CBP plans to complete by the end of 2020.\\n\\nAsked about the president's promises that Mexico would pay for the structure, Morgan said he didn't care how the wall would be funded.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm the commissioner of CBP, he said. That's a political thing to me. . . . I don't care who's paying for the wall. All I care about is that it's being built.\\n\\nAs the acting CBP chief, Morgan has attended meetings at the White House in recent weeks to discuss the administration's concerns about wall funding, including a gathering Trump adviser Jared Kushner led last month at which senior officials outlined a plan to divert $3.6 billion from the Pentagon budget for the second year in a row."}

{"original": "The careful posture reflects the Pentagon's wariness in the final days of a presidency during which Trump has tested the norms of a politically impartial military. It also comes after all 10 living former U.S. defense secretaries published a joint open letter warning that the military shouldn't play a role in determining the election outcome or interrupt a peaceful transition.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConcerns that Trump may reach for the military to retain power as he enters the final chapter of resistance to the election's result have grown sharper in recent days, partly after his former national security adviser, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, floated a declaration of martial law and a rerun of the election overseen by the military in a mid-December Oval Office meeting — a suggestion Flynn also has made publicly in the media. Trump, meanwhile, pressured Georgia's secretary of state to find 11,780 votes he needs to win the state.\\n\\nIt's the fear that you are not dealing with someone who recognizes any responsibility to the Constitution. His only responsibility, from this president's point of view, is to himself, former defense secretary Leon Panetta said in an interview, when asked about the rationale for the letter. When you operate on that basis, there's no holds barred as to what a president may do. It is that scenario that scares the hell out of people in terms of the future of our democracy.\\n\\nOne day before Congress votes to certify that Joe Biden won the presidential election, Trump supporters on Jan. 5 gathered in Washington to protest the results. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nCurrent and former top officials said they believe the Pentagon brass has considered the possibility that Trump will issue a legally questionable order as part of his gambit to overturn the election results and prevent President-elect Joe Biden from entering the White House.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA senior U.S. official said Tuesday that the Pentagon senior leadership — civilian and military — will not obey an unlawful order from the president to use the military to his own political ends.\\n\\nThese leaders likely would resign before following an unlawful order, the senior official said, adding, however, I think it's unfair to assume that the president would issue an unlawful order.\\n\\nBut Trump's effort to overturn the election results has been so norm-shattering that senior Pentagon officials are being forced to consider the possibility of receiving orders that previously would have been unthinkable from a sitting U.S. president.\\n\\nIn a real way, generals are paid to worry about everything. So while I really don't expect the military to be asked to do anything truly questionable, it's always best to expect the unexpected and prepare accordingly. My bet is that they have their lawyers at the ready, said Charlie Dunlap, a retired Air Force major general and executive director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke University.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSince taking office, Trump has repeatedly flouted norms governing presidential interactions with the military, signing his ban on travel from majority-Muslim nations at the Pentagon, diverting Pentagon funds to pay for his border wall, treating troop events like campaign rallies and intervening in military justice matters. Some of his orders to the Pentagon, such as the holdup of congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine and the diversion of military funds to construct the border wall, have later been deemed illegal.\\n\\nPeter Feaver, a scholar of civil-military relations and a colleague of Dunlap's at Duke, said current Pentagon leaders were better prepared to handle any attempts to pull them into the transition because of the events of June 2020, when Trump sought to use expansive military force to put down widespread protests over police violence against Black citizens.\\n\\nThen-Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, argued behind the scenes against invoking the Insurrection Act to allow Trump to employ active-duty troops in the nation's capital. But they came under intense criticism over public statements and appearances that seemed to support Trump's heavy-handed response to civilians in the streets, which included the use of tear gas and rubber pellets to disperse protesters near the White House before Trump posed for photos with a Bible in front of St. John's Church.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the subsequent months, officials have tightened procedures for employing the National Guard in an effort to reduce the likelihood of the White House calling in active-duty forces, and senior officials have repeatedly affirmed the military's duty to remain loyal to the Constitution rather to any individual and decline any illegal orders. They have also studied relevant laws and assembled the capability to track civil unrest across the country to better prepare them for possible White House requests.\\n\\nThe senior U.S. official said the military leadership had learned from what happened last June. Everyone has got a lot of scar tissue and a lot of PTSD from the domestic unrest of the summer and does not want a repeat, the official said.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, the official said, the Pentagon hopes to make clear that the Guard is only serving as traffic control without guns, military vehicles or helicopters to aid the local police in Washington and steer clear of flashpoint areas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe've learned our lessons and will be absolutely nowhere near the Capitol Building, the senior U.S. official said, adding: We don't want to send the wrong message. This is allowing the police to be able to do their jobs.\\n\\nStill, U.S. law grants broad powers to the commander in chief, particularly if the president finds reason to declare a state of emergency, as Trump did on the southern border to divert Pentagon funding to his border wall project. And Trump retains command of the D.C. Guard, because the District is not a state, as well as the power to relieve senior officials at will.\\n\\nThings like the Insurrection Act and the general authorities of the president as commander in chief — there is room here for a president to abuse his responsibility in this area, Panetta said. I think all of us can argue that the military has absolutely no role in determining elections, or for that matter in doing what law enforcement is responsible for doing in this country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPentagon leaders have also sought to keep a mostly low profile on political issues. When Esper, who was fired by Trump in November, traveled overseas in the months before the election, he remained tightly focused in public comments on security matters, even as his diplomatic counterpart, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, appeared at the Republican National Convention and freely made political remarks.\\n\\nAfter Flynn suggested declaring martial law and using the military to rerun the election, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and Gen. James McConville, the Army chief of staff, issued a stark response: There is no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of an American election.\\n\\nFeaver said he believed that senior officials, including Milley and acting defense secretary Christopher C. Miller, were right to remain mostly silent on political-related matters, if only because speaking out might provoke an unwanted action from Trump.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRight now the president is focusing his attention on other things, and so if they were too prominent in the public, they would attract the Eye of Sauron in a way that would not be helpful, Feaver said.\\n\\nHow Miller might respond to a request from Trump is unclear. A retired Army colonel, Miller comes from the secretive worlds of counterterrorism and Special Operations, and his policy views are largely unknown. Trump tapped him as acting Pentagon chief after falling out with Esper, who had objected to using active-duty military on U.S. streets in June.\\n\\nRetired Adm. James Stavridis, who served as supreme allied commander of NATO, said that while the former defense secretaries' appeal was remarkable, current defense leaders needed to speak out, too.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat is needed is more clear guidance from the most senior levels in the Pentagon, he said in an email to The Washington Post, singling out Miller. The Acting SECDEF in particular should issue a direct statement echoing what [Milley], Secretary of the Army, and Chief of Staff of the Army have all said: there is no role for the military in resolving any election controversies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe events in June served as a wake-up call to many top officials at the Pentagon and in Congress about Trump's willingness to reach for the military to advance his personal and political interests. In the most recent defense policy bill, Congress passed a law requiring all federal troops or law enforcement officers to wear uniforms showing their names and agencies, after federal agents under the Justice Department deployed this summer without insignia.\\n\\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who worked on the law, sent a letter Tuesday to the heads of the Defense Department, the Army and the Justice Department reminding them of the requirement.\\n\\nI have faith that our military chain of command will not stand in the way of a peaceful transition of power, Murphy said Tuesday in an interview. But there certainly is a risk that the president is going to put the military chain of command in the uncomfortable position of refusing to blockade Joe Biden from entering the White House.\\n\\nMurphy added, It's not good for democracy if they are in a position where they have to refuse the commander in chief.\\n\\nFormer defense secretary William J. Perry, one of the ex-Pentagon bosses who signed the letter this week, said the joint statement was meant to stiffen the resolve of Pentagon leaders should Trump order them in any way to help him retain power.\\n\\nI know that our military is very disciplined, but they also have been trained to obey orders, and the two civilians who can order them are the secretary of defense or the president, Perry said.\\n\\nI believe there could be real ambiguity in the minds of the military in what was legal and what was not legal, especially if the order is coming from the president, Perry added in an interview.\\n\\nMilitary law to a large degree incentivizes personnel to obey orders, which poses a dilemma when the lawfulness of an order is difficult to determine. Dunlap said the law allows military subordinates to presume an order to be lawful unless it is patently illegal — and simply because an order is unwise or ill-considered doesn't make it illegal.\\n\\nMurphy said there is a lot less ambiguity around military intervention in the transfer of power from one president to another than there is in other kinds of orders from the president with questionable legal backing."}
{"original": "Further, Texas boosters must grapple with paying their ex-guy only roughly the same amount not to coach as South Carolina will pay its ex-guy, Will Muschamp. That one has to hurt.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNor is it amazing that Texas will pay Herman $15 million not to coach four months after layoffs and pay cuts in the athletic department to save $13 million, with one of those prepared statements containing excruciating layoff passages such as extremely challenging times, ever-changing times and planning ways to put us in a position for success moving forward. Some might find that amazing, but remember, the priority of the American football donor is finding the guy who can beat the hell out of the despicable rivals on the schedule, as well as those somewhat less despicable.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo, what's amazing is that Texas has gone a so-so 78-60 across 11 seasons with all that money, which is humorous if you can refrain from sobbing. And what's really amazing is thinking back to Monday, Oct. 12, 2015, surveying the landscape of that day, and then realizing that five years and change later, Steve Sarkisian would replace Tom Herman at Texas.\\n\\nOn that Monday, Southern California athletic director Pat Haden fired Sarkisian amid his second season as head coach after his troubles with alcohol found its way into team meetings, practices and events. And on that Monday, Herman's first Houston team stood 5-0 on its way to 13-1 and a Peach Bowl drubbing of Florida State, making him one of the hottest coaches in the history of hot coaches.\\n\\nHerman, 40 at the time, had just finished a stint as Ohio State's offensive coordinator in which the Buckeyes surged to a national championship even through the outrageous inconvenience of two injured starting quarterbacks. Houston's recruiting roared, and Herman headed for Texas by November 2016 as a choice more obvious than plain-old obvious.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo sit in his office and listen to him in the summer of 2017, before it all got started, was to wonder how some people wind up with this magnetic confidence that others of us would like to try on for a day. To see the whole thing go sideways to 9-10 against ranked teams and 1-4 against Oklahoma and zero Big 12 titles and just one title-game appearance and 32-18 over four seasons at a place that doesn't crave 32-18 . . . and to see the recruiting rankings for the big-energy young coach plunge from No. 4 (2018 and 2019, per Rivals) to No. 14 (2020) and No. 16 (2021), one spot ahead of, sheesh, North Carolina, coached by Mack Brown, who spent a good while at Texas . . .\\n\\nWait, Tom Herman ends up one of those dudes who gets the old vote of half-confidence from the athletic director Dec. 12 and then the sacking Jan. 2?\\n\\nTexas Athletic Director Chris Del Conte, Dec. 12: When I look at our football program right now, I see tremendous young men and promising talent. Our student-athletes are developing, and they play their hearts out. . . . I want to reiterate that Tom Herman is our coach.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTexas Athletic Director Chris Del Conte, Jan. 2: Decisions like this are very, very difficult and certainly not something I take lightly. As I've said before, my philosophy is to wait until the end of the season to look at all the factors in evaluating any of our programs. After much deliberation and a great deal of thought, as I looked back at the totality of where our football program is and in discussing its future, it became apparent that it was in the best interest of the University of Texas to move in a different direction.\\n\\nSo Herman became the subject of that kind of dialect, so drearily familiar in the American experience. Next, you're going to say they replaced a 45-year-old Herman with a 46-year-old Sarkisian?\\n\\nThat's the second half of amazement. The long lens on Sarkisian's comeback yields something richly impressive, coursing twice through Nick Saban's Alabama, that portal for the wayward. The trajectory went all the way to the Broyles Award this season as the top assistant coach in the land, coordinating Alabama's otherworldly offense, the receivers darting about with unparalleled skill and geometric beauty.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSaban had Sarkisian as offensive coordinator briefly in winter 2016-17 after shooing Lane Kiffin before the national championship game after Kiffin, on his way out the door to Florida Atlantic, reiterated that his knacks don't include silence. Then when Sarkisian left a minute later for the Atlanta Falcons, Saban displayed a notable lack of pettiness when he rehired Sarkisian in winter 2018-19.\\n\\nI've just tried to be a sponge here, man, Sarkisian said ahead of Friday's Rose Bowl win over Notre Dame, calling Saban the best to ever do it. He said: And then a year ago I had a couple opportunities to become a head coach, and I decided to come back because it felt like my work here wasn't done. You know, I felt like I owed it to him. I made a commitment to him to be part of this program. . . .\\n\\nI think probably the biggest thing I've learned from him is his ability to balance all aspects of the program, whether it's on the field, off the field, recruiting, all that goes into being a head coach at a place like Alabama, those are all the things I've tried to take in from him because his balance of all of that is what I think is pretty incredible.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "Preparing for the future\\n\\nIf the United States withdraws from Syria, Afghanistan and potentially Iraq , its planning for potential future engagements with the Islamic State or some splinter organization should include a robust strategy for collecting intelligence from locals, lest it repeat its experience during the early months of the Iraq War.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat's what we concluded after evaluating emails recently released by the U.S. government from the first year of the Iraq invasion in 2003.\\n\\nThe emails consist primarily of tips that Iraqis sent to the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) — the country's transitional government — from December 2003 to May 2004. They offer a rare, unfiltered look into the shadowy world of human intelligence collection. And they help piece together the historical record of America's knowledge of and response to the growing insurgency in Iraq.\\n\\nThese and other wartime documents suggest that the CPA did not lack intelligence during this early war period. Rather, it probably had difficulty determining the credibility and relative importance of potentially competing information. Its tips program had too few resources and ran into trouble coordinating with various U.S. entities deployed in Iraq.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat challenges did the United States' early tips efforts face?\\n\\nThe CPA originally launched the tips program to help root out corruption and track down senior Baathists, including Saddam Hussein himself. But Iraqi citizens responded with a much broader range of information. While we now know that some of the tips were inaccurate or irrelevant, at the time these were potentially considered serious.\\n\\nMuch of the information received may have distracted U.S. officials from the growing insurgency. For instance, the CPA received a number of tips about weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which may help explain why the United States kept searching for WMD for more than 18 months after the invasion had begun. Several informants claimed to personally know where these weapons were hidden and who was handling them.\\n\\nAs you can see in the email below, one writer even referred directly to the U.N. inspections that immediately preceded the invasion, describing a large campaign to hide WMD evidence beforehand.\\n\\nOther emails describe kidnappings, hostage situations, black market gasoline sales, the theft of gold from Saddam Hussein's family, and even Russian intelligence activity. Iraqis also emailed in tips on alleged Baathist activities, which may have reinforced U.S. analysts' expectations that Saddam loyalists were the most likely to organize violent resistance.\\n\\nHowever, a number of the emails also pointed to the growing threat from al-Qaeda and Shiite militancy. These tips varied considerably in quality and the types of actions they might have prompted. Some reported on particulars about the insurgency, including both weapons and terrorists coming into the country from Syria, and where to find weapons caches and safe houses, as you can see below.\\n\\nStill other emails warned U.S. officials that Shiite militias were growing, referencing weapons sales in Baghdad's Sadr City and indicating that Iraqis were awaiting orders from Ayatollah Sistani to attack American forces.\\n\\nIt's not clear that such reports were reliable. For instance, the intelligence report above notes that the information's source was untested. Other intelligence documents refer to cases of disinformation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat did the CPA do with information it received?\\n\\nInvestigators acted on a number of tips, leading to the confiscation of hundreds of AK-47s, hand and rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons and the arrests of suspects. One of these early tips even led to the discovery of an Iraqi Air Force plane that had been hidden.\\n\\nHowever, as the internal report below shows, only one team was generally available to investigate tips. Furthermore, roughly a dozen armed U.S. and Iraqi entities were unavailable to the tips programs. As a result, they had to discard some of the usable tips.\\n\\nOther internal messages reference constraints on the tips program's email and telephone hotline. As shown in the email below from February 2004, only two personnel and one translator were available to run the lines, and members of the tips program were given little feedback on the tips that were sent along. The writer of this message warned of a loss of credibility with Iraqis.\\n\\nA lesson for future counterinsurgency efforts\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the coalition increased its focus on counterinsurgency as the war progressed, its tips collection programs became more sophisticated. Iraqis eventually sent in thousands of quality tips, leading to the arrests of key former Baathists and al-Qaeda members, and the bombings that finally killed Zarqawi, according to U.S. Army Maj. Daniel Castro, referring to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq.\\n\\nIraq's insurgents clearly thought the programs were important; they went to great lengths to disrupt them with such efforts as placing malicious calls designed to tie up hotlines , as one of the author's research finds.\\n\\nThere is no simple way to know whether the early implementation of a more developed tips collection program would have slowed or limited the deterioration of Iraq's security. Some scholars argue that other factors made insurgency inevitable, including the limited number of U.S. troops deployed and the de-Baathification policy and its decision to disband Iraq's military.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the United States appears to have gone into Iraq with few plans for how to solicit and evaluate critical information from civilians taking advantage of their access to cellular telephones and the Internet. Planning for future counterinsurgency operations may wish to include a more thorough approach to collecting tips and disseminating the information within them among U.S. forces.\\n\\nAndrew Shaver is a postdoctoral scholar in political science at Stanford University and the founding director of Dartmouth College's Political Violence Lab at the John Sloan Dickey Center.

{"original": "The recent spate of crises has called to attention the need to prepare, as best we can, for something similar to happen in the future. As a homeowner, there are certain considerations and affairs to get in order to prepare for these disasters — whether it's insurance matters, property protection measures or communication precautions. But if you're among the growing population of individuals choosing to rent in America, you might find yourself feeling anxious and unsure about where responsibility lies in these emergency situations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's important to know what resources are available and what processes your community has in place to effectively and safely navigate the storm. While avoiding or predicting disasters may be impossible, here are three actions you can take now to save you precious time and, hopefully, heartache if that day ever comes:\\n\\nLearn how your community communicates\\n\\nMaybe you've just moved in, or are looking at moving to a new building. Maybe you've lived there for years. Regardless of tenure, one question every resident should know the answer to is How does my apartment community communicate?\\n\\nWhen you signed your lease, did the agent hook you into the community's comprehensive online portal, like RealPage or Yardi — two of the many providers who offer that type of system? Do they use an app — such as Mobile Doorman — to keep residents apprised of information? Or have you noticed taped fliers to each door when there's a message the property manager needs to get across? From text messages and robo-calls to push notifications, communities are always honing the ways they get in touch.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFind out what the answer is, and then evaluate it for efficiency.\\n\\nIf you're concerned that the channel and pace of communication could be an issue in an emergency, initiate that discussion with your community's management now.\\n\\nIt'd be a whole lot better to know of an issue as it's happening than to be asking questions only after seeing emergency personnel respond. Or to get a text message or push notification letting you know exactly where and when to move your car in the event of forecast flooding, instead of waiting for the rain to come.\\n\\nProbe where responsibilities lie\\n\\nWhen you own a home, it's clear whose responsibility it is to ensure there's a generator on site in the event of a power outage, or to shutter the windows before an impending hurricane.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMake sure you have the same clarity as to which responsibilities are yours as an apartment resident. Review the information available at FEMA's Ready.gov and use it as your guide to have those conversations with your property manager.\\n\\nMake a point to understand what areas of your unit, or of the community, would provide the most shelter from a storm or other non-evacuation emergency. Develop your own plan in the event of a loss of power, and confirm what channels you should rely on for information on restoration. Residents reliant on electricity for health issues should plan ahead and consider purchasing an Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) to provide emergency power as a fail-safe.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAdditionally, evaluate your renter's insurance policy to be completely abreast of your coverage, and then push to understand within your community what your role is in an emergency. Renter's insurance doesn't cover flooding, and the National Flood Insurance Program's policy for an apartment building does not cover contents, so look into getting your own policy to cover your possessions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLearn about your evacuation options\\n\\nWhat if the worst happens, and evacuation is the order or recommendation for your area?\\n\\nYou've received the notification from your management, and you know getting out of harm's way must be the priority. Where can you go?\\n\\nEducate yourself on the tools at your disposal. Apartment residents may not be aware of the options when faced with dire straits. They can be unique to each geographic area or rental community, so it's important to begin your query in quieter times.\\n\\nAsk about disaster policies in the event of a flood, fire or other natural disaster to learn about any past programming or plans for future issues. For example, is there a hotline or online portal available for evacuees in need of housing assistance? Ask the question now.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOnce you're safely away from the danger area, remember to check your community's communication mechanism often to find out when residents may be cleared to return and other important information about the status of your home.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we don't have a crystal ball to alert us to when the next natural disaster or other emergency situation may arise, but preparedness can certainly help. Don't wait until you're in the thick of it to get answers to your questions and craft your plan — be your own best advocate now."}
{"original": "Though it's the coldest, driest and windiest place on Earth, Antarctica offers an adventure to tourists unlike any other: Camping on glaciers, seeing king penguins up close, kayaking around icebergs and attending world-class scientific lectures. Its beauty — and the threat of increasing Antarctic ice loss — are enough to get tourists to pay at least $5,000 to visit the world's only continent without cities or time zones.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTourism in Antarctica has risen from fewer than 2,000 visitors in the 1980s to more than 45,000 visitors from around the world last year. The number of people traveling to the frozen continent dipped during the economic recession of the late 2000s, but rose again in recent years, according to data kept by the Rhode-Island based International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators.\\n\\nAs far as tourism numbers go, Antarctica's might not seem high, especially compared to the tens of millions of people each year visiting countries such as France, Spain and the United States. But in Antarctica, a remote and increasingly vulnerable continent whose primary residents are researchers, tourism comes at an environmental cost. The cruise ships bringing travelers from Chilean and Argentine ports, for example, also carry air pollutants that can further devastate the region.\\n\\nWhat used to be Antarctic tourism in the late '80s through the '90s was generally people of middle age or older going on cruises and small ships where they went ashore at a few locations and they looked at wildlife, historic sites and maybe visited one current station, Alan Hemmings, a polar legal expert who once commanded a British base in Antarctica, told USA Today in 2013.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut there's an increasing diversification of the activities now so it's much more action orientated. Now people want to go paragliding, water skiing, diving or a variety of other things, he said.\\n\\nChinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration officials first announced the new set of rules for behavior in Antarctica in September, after realizing it was one of four countries that had signed the Antarctic Treaty but had not established regulations for its citizens, the South China Morning Post reported. The other countries are India, Poland and Ecuador, according to the Post.\\n\\nThere weren't any tourists visiting Antarctica in 1959, when the treaty was first created and signed by a dozen nations who supported peaceful scientific study there. Since then, the number of signatory countries has grown to 53.\\n\\nChinese citizens last year made up 12 percent of Antarctica's visitors, with about 5,500 people making trips that typically include chartered flights or cruises that cost at least 100,000 yuan, or almost $16,000. The number of people visiting from China between 2016 and 2017 was second only to the United States, which sent almost 15,000 people, according to IAATO data.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChina's new regulations mandate that tourists and tour groups minimize their footprint on Antarctica's environment, and bans them from taking part in any activities that could harm or disturb wildlife. Inspectors will watch tourists' actions, and those who violate the policy will be banned from visiting Antarctica for up to three years, the Post wrote.\\n\\nIn addition to protecting the continent, China's rules are meant to support its sustainable development in Antarctica, the Post reported. China has four Antarctic research sites and on Wednesday began working on a fifth, which is expected to be ready by 2022.\\n\\nRead more:"}
{"original": "It attracted 19 million applicants for 63,000 vacancies.\\n\\nGujjar, the son of a farmer and the first person in his family to attend college, was one of them. At the test center in Delhi where he took a mandatory exam in November, he looked around warily at hundreds of young men like him. Nearly all were college students or graduates. Some even had master's degrees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India's employment conundrum. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world, but it is not generating enough jobs — let alone good jobs — for the increasingly educated young people entering the labor force.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy 2021, the number of people in India between the ages of 15 and 34 is expected to reach 480 million. They have higher levels of literacy and are staying in school longer than any previous generation of Indians. The youth surge represents an opportunity for this country of 1.3 billion, economists say, but only if such young people can find productive work.\\n\\nRecent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all Indian states between 2011 and 2016. Jobless rates for young people and those with higher educational qualifications increased during the same period, in some cases sharply: The unemployment rate for college graduates jumped from 4.1 percent to 8.4 percent, according to Santosh Mehrotra, a well-known labor economist.\\n\\nThe fate of India's millions of job-seekers represents a major political liability for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he seeks reelection this year. Modi came to power almost five years ago promising development for all and robust job creation. But his attempts to increase manufacturng and entrepreneurship have not succeeded in turbocharging employment.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Modi's controversial move in late 2016 to ­invalidate most of India's bank notes — ostensibly to stem corruption — had a deleterious impact on workers. About 3 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, a research firm in Mumbai that conducts a national employment survey. Its data also showed that the Indian labor force shrank between 2017 and 2018 — not a sign of a healthy job market.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIndia is rapidly losing an opportunity, said Mahesh Vyas, the chief executive of the research firm. We're just arguing needlessly and endlessly rather than deploying all these young people coming into the labor market into productive work. The result is a slow and insidious crisis, he said.\\n\\nFor many young Indian people, finding a job is an all-consuming task. An entire industry has sprung up offering personality development classes — a combination of basic English, social skills and interview preparation advertised as improving employability. Job scams are common, with fraudsters preying on the aspirations of those seeking work.\\n\\nEducated youths do not want to be pakora wallahs — people who make a quintessential fried Indian snack — said Radhicka Kapoor, an economist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. They want good, productive jobs, and they're going to wait it out until they in fact find these jobs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAjit Ghose, an economist at the Institute for Human Development in Delhi, says that India needs to generate jobs not only for fresh entrants to the workforce — who number 6 million to 8 million a year, according to his estimate — but also for people, mostly women, who are working far less than they would be if they could get stable jobs that paid a decent wage. Ghose has calculated that India has at least 104 million such surplus workers.\\n\\nThat's a monumental challenge for any government — and one that India's leadership is not meeting. Judging the Modi government's track record on job creation is complicated by the fact that it has not released any comprehensive nationwide employment data since 2016. The Labor and Statistics ministries have conducted more-recent employment surveys of Indian households, but those results have not been made public.\\n\\nIt's anybody's guess whether we'll see any employment statistics come out before the 2019 elections, said Amit Basole, an economist at Azim Premji University.\\n\\nArvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argued that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry. Meanwhile, he said, his sense was that concerns about job creation are overblown, given India's high rates of economic growth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor India's educated youths, searching for a job that meets their aspirations can feel like a marathon. At the test center in Delhi, waves of applicants for the railway positions arrived three times a day, each weekday, from September through mid-December — a scene replicated at hundreds of exam centers across the country.\\n\\nThe flow of test-takers was so large and consistent that it created its own miniature economy. One entrepreneur operated a makeshift storage locker out of a nearby parked truck. Since the applicants could not take anything inside the exam center, he kept backpacks and phones for a fee of 50 rupees (70 cents). A vendor sold tube socks and ear buds on the sidewalk.\\n\\nThe railway jobs on offer — sometimes referred to as Group D positions — are junior but offer security and a comparatively good salary. The starting pay is 18,000 rupees ($250) a month, plus there are perks such as free train travel.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe stories of the young men — and they were all men, with one exception, at a test center in Delhi over two days — are striking in their sameness. The applicants are mostly college students and college graduates from the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan who are seeking a way out of the villages where they grew up. There are no jobs there, they said.\\n\\nGujjar arrived in Delhi for the first time in his life the evening before his 9 a.m. exam. He spent the night sleeping on a sheet that he spread on the floor of the railway station. Early the next morning, he took a bus to the exam center, where he stood, waiting, in a thin striped sweater, arms crossed against the predawn chill. At 7:35 a.m., a guard carrying a portable loudspeaker began barking instructions to the assembled test-takers.\\n\\nToo anxious for chitchat, ­Gujjar declined to describe how he felt at that moment. Ask me after I see the exam paper, he said. The posts at Indian Railways held no inherent appeal, he explained. It's not about interest, he said. I just want a job.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGujjar, 19, helps his parents farm a small plot of land where they grow wheat and millet. A year ago, he tried to join the Indian army, but he did not make the cut in a qualifying exam. There are no opportunities in his village in the district of ­Jhunjhunu, he said, and most of his friends do not have steady work.\\n\\nAfter taking the 90-minute computerized test, Gujjar strode through a blue metal gate with a smile of relief on his face. The exam was not as difficult as he had feared. It will be months before he knows whether he has beaten the odds, which are roughly 1 in 300. If I get a job, it will be worth it, he said."}
{"original": "That was the expression on Stephon Gilmore's face when asked about ESPN's report that Brady, Coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft no longer get along, and the franchise is coming apart from the force of their egos. Gilmore paused in his gray sweats in the center of a swarm of reporters and actually said, What report?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe one that says something has turned sour inside the franchise that is going for its sixth Super Bowl title in 17 seasons. The one that started a storm in the week before their divisional playoff game against the Tennessee Titans, by suggesting there are imperceptible but widening cracks on their team despite a 13-3 record and the top seed in the AFC. That one. What about it?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm all-in on Tennessee, said Belichick, in that bottom-of-a-drain voice of his, where expression goes to die.\\n\\nOutside, a crew worked to remove the snow built up from last week's blizzard from Gillette Stadium. Shovel by shovel, they methodically cleared the aisles and each step of the stadium stairs, even as an aluminum sky overhead threatened to bring another nor'easter. Inside, the Patriots worked at the same dull, digging pace, shoveling out platitudes and refusing to admit any chink in this impenetrable fortress of a franchise, which so many teams would love to believe is finally permeable, and might even collapse from within.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCan't anybody help us but us, cornerback Malcolm Butler said. We're all we got. That's how you have to look at it.\\n\\nYou just don't pay attention to it, he added. It's hard sometimes when people are just talking, but when it comes down to it, it's keeping your head down and keep pushing and not worrying about people that aren't in our locker room and going through things we're going through. And keep it real tight.\\n\\nPrivately, people on the inside acknowledge that tensions are inevitable between competitive people who have spent years together under a variety of high pressures. Brady is a quirky obsessive, and the driven Belichick knows only one tone: demanding. But they also adamantly insist that the situation is not as dire as portrayed. Someday the Patriots' run will end, because Brady is, after all, 40 years old, says a person close to him. But not for this reason.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo believe the Patriots are fracturing, and this is their last big run, you have to believe that the three principal characters have begun to behave in profoundly uncharacteristic ways. You have to throw away almost everything you know and have seen of Brady, Belichick and Kraft for two decades. You have to believe that Brady, for the first time in his career, has become a pouty diva who demands special status and privileges and have to ignore the many times he has restructured his contract to make it more team-friendly in the interest of winning. You have to believe that he is so insecure that he pressed for his backup Jimmy Garoppolo to be traded, and rejoiced when Garoppolo was dealt to the 49ers.\\n\\nIn 18 years I have never celebrated when a player was traded or cut, Brady said, refuting the notion on his weekly radio show Tuesday morning. It is such a poor characterization.\\n\\nYou'd have to believe that Kraft abandoned his longtime policy of being resolutely hands-off about football matters. You have to believe that one of the most restrained and organizationally conscious owners in the league suddenly called Belichick to the owner's suite and big-footed him, instructed Belichick to trade Garoppolo to appease Brady. Kraft insists the meeting and the mandate absolutely didn't happen.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd you'd have to believe that the famously dispassionate Belichick became suddenly more emotionally attached to Garoppolo, who had won just two games for the Patriots, than to an MVP who has won five Super Bowls, including two of the last three. And that Belichick therefore, for the first time in his highly calculating career, made a terrible deal and maybe even intentionally kneecapped the organization he has so painstakingly hand-built. As opposed to doing the careful math on the Patriots' salary cap and the money they would have to offer Garoppolo to keep playing behind Brady, and the leverage they were likely to lose if he didn't move on a deal for Garoppolo in what he saw as the last window to get some value for him.\\n\\nYou'd have to believe he wanted Garoppolo to embarrass the Patriots — as opposed to hoping that by sending him to a struggling team across the country and in an opposite division and conference in the NFC West, under a first-year head coach, he likely wouldn't come back to beat them on the field any time soon.\\n\\nEveryone complains about their bosses. Everyone gets testy with their longtime mates. It doesn't always mean you want to divorce, or quit, or tear down all you've built. Brady's unexpected good health and MVP level of play at age 40 undeniably has put the Patriots in a unique kind of limbo, and no doubt it comes with tension. Especially given his reliance on the highly unconventional health guru, Alex Guerrero, whose special access undoubtedly angered the conventional medical and training staffs — who have reason to be territorial and defensive given Brady's very public rejection of their pill-needle-and-knife care.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the real indication that the mortar is dissolving in this building will not come from media reports. It will come from a subtle change in the on-field habits that have been the Patriots' signatures for years, the lockstep precision and attention to detail and their remarkably disciplined focus, the ability to shut out everything else and to control the day, as special teams captain Matthew Slater put it.\\n\\nYou'll know it if they become a telltale bit slipshod. That single fundamental you've been talking about since OTAs? That can be pivotal on Saturday, Slater said. You'll know when you see a faint decline in their will, to put up with the pressures and the noise and the inevitable nor'easters, both weather-born and media-brought, that come with their success. Saturday night. Foxborough, Gillette. Fans loud. Cold, Slater says.\\n\\nMaybe the Patriots are done. Maybe Brady really is slipping and feeling threatened, and Belichick is disenchanted, and maybe it's time for a new organization, led by younger men. Or just maybe they aren't done yet,. Maybe they remain the most inflexible, uncompromising, exacting, self-willed and victory-ravenous team you've ever seen.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFate whispers to the warrior, 'You cannot withstand the storm,' Brady posted on Instagram late Monday.

{"original": "The Trump administration on Tuesday insisted that the U.S. military would remain in Iraq after killing a top Iranian commander in Baghdad last week, setting up a highly visible conflict with senior Iraqi officials, who have demanded an immediate withdrawal.\\n\\nPresident Trump, speaking at the White House, said that withdrawing the estimated 5,000 U.S. troops would be the worst thing to happen to Iraq.\\n\\nAt some point, we want to get out, Trump said. But this isn't the right point.\\n\\nThe comments came amid signs that the U.S. military presence is growing increasingly untenable, at least in its current form, in the fallout from the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. military drone strike last week.\\n\\nIt's a hostile environment, said Sajad Jiyad, who heads the Al-Bayan Center think tank in Baghdad. They are potentially not wanted, the costs are high, and the risks are high.\\n\\nAfter days of threatening revenge, Iranian forces launched more than a dozen missiles at two U.S. bases in Iraq on Tuesday night in a dramatic escalation of tensions.\\n\\n[Live updates]\\n\\nIt is clear these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel, the Pentagon said in a statement.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe attacks came as U.S. officials continued to defend killing Soleimani as a response to months of increased Iranian aggression toward Americans in Iraq. They pointed to his role in directing operations that have left hundreds of U.S. troops dead over the past 20 years.\\n\\nThe chaos has been highlighted by the reaction in Baghdad to a letter sent by a senior U.S. commander to Iraqi officials Monday. The document suggested that the United States may be preparing to withdraw its troops. Marine Brig. Gen. William H. Seely III wrote that Americans would be using helicopters to reposition U.S. forces for onward movement and were required to take certain measures to ensure that the movement out of Iraq is conducted in a safe and efficient manner.\\n\\nIraqi officials said Tuesday that they are interpreting the letter as notification that U.S. troops will leave. Acting prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said the document was clear and expressed exasperation with conflicting U.S. signals.\\n\\nIt's not like a draft, or a paper that fell out of the photocopier and coincidentally came to us, Mahdi told the Iraqi cabinet in comments on state television.\\n\\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper, speaking at the Pentagon, dismissed the letter as a draft that has no value, and he insinuated that its release to the public in Iraq may have had ulterior motives.\\n\\nThere may be people trying to create confusion, he said. Our policy has not changed.\\n\\nEsper, when asked whether a signed copy had been sent to the Iraqis, said not to the best of my knowledge.\\n\\nBut Iraqi officials said the Americans sent them the letter not once, but twice, because of an error in how it was initially translated. U.S. military officials confirmed the letter was genuine, and one said that a version sent to Iraqi officials was signed.\\n\\nThe military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the letter was intended to convey to Iraqi officials that the U.S. military would take reasonable steps following the killing of Soleimani, including pulling troops back to fewer bases. Such a move would make it easier to protect them, as well as easier to withdraw if required.\\n\\nThe official said it is unclear why the letter was released, but we must ensure that our candid correspondence with our Iraqi partners remains fluid and factual.\\n\\nThe U.S.-led military coalition in Baghdad referred questions about the letter to the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations across the Middle East. Officials there did not respond to several requests for comment.\\n\\nIn Baghdad, two Iraqi officials said Mahdi had concluded that a U.S. troop withdrawal is now necessary in light of the spiraling tensions between the United States and Iran, which risk putting Iraq in the middle of a new war.\\n\\nIn the prime minister's view, there is no way to ensure the stability of Iraq without the withdrawal of foreign forces, said one of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue with candor.\\n\\nWe won against ISIS, the official said, referring to the Islamic State militant group. Having [the U.S.] here now complicates things more.\\n\\nSenior U.S. officials have continued to defend the strike that killed Soleimani.\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has done the bulk of the administration's speaking on the subject, said Tuesday that Trump's advisers gave him all the best information they could about the strike on Soleimani before he approved it.\\n\\nIt was the right decision, we got it right, the Department of Defense did excellent work and the president had an entirely legal, appropriate . . . basis as well as a decision that fit perfectly within our strategy in how to counter the threat of malign activity from Iran more broadly, Pompeo said.\\n\\nEsper, who had not appeared on camera to discuss the strike until Tuesday, blamed Iran for its history of attacks over the past 40 years when asked if the United States also has a responsibility to de-escalate tensions between the two countries.\\n\\nWe reached the point where we had to act in self-defense, Esper said. We had to take appropriate action.\\n\\nAs U.S. officials debated their future in Iraq, some allies began to evacuate their own troops following the parliamentary vote. The German government said the 100 or so troops it had based outside Iraq's Kurdistan region had been relocated to Kuwait or Jordan. Canada said it would be withdrawing 500 troops from Iraq.\\n\\nThe cascade of events comes after an escalating campaign of rocket strikes against U.S. troops hosted on Iraqi bases carried out by Kataib Hezbollah, one of the Iranian-backed militias commanded by Soleimani. After the death of a U.S. contractor in one of those strikes late last month prompted retaliatory U.S. airstrikes against Kataib Hezbollah, Iraqi fears of being caught up in a war between Iran and the United States intensified.\\n\\nFor U.S. troops to remain in Iraq, there would have to be guarantees that the United States would cease to use its presence in Iraq to attack Iranian targets, Jiyad said. As it is, he said, it appears to Iraqis as though the chief purpose for the United States to remain in Iraq is to confront Iran.\\n\\nThe Islamic State would doubtless be emboldened by any U.S. pullout, but the immediate concern for us in Iraq is: Are things going to get worse because the United States is in Iraq? Jiyad asked.\\n\\nThe possibility of a U.S. escalation with Iran is high, the probability of airstrikes is high, so right now, it looks as if the greater risk comes from the U.S. being in Iraq, he said.\\n\\nThere are many in Iraq who would like to salvage the U.S. presence, said Michael Knights of the Washington Institute of Near East Policy. He noted that the vote in parliament was conducted in the absence of Sunni and Kurdish members, by a show of hands that did not provide evidence of overwhelming majority support for a departure of U.S. forces.\\n\\nThere are ways in which the U.S. military could renegotiate the terms of its presence to satisfy Iraqi concerns while also sustaining the goal of combating any revival of the Islamic State, he said. They could include maintaining a low-profile U.S. Special Forces presence to conduct raids against the Islamic State and redefining the U.S. mission as one of providing advice and training to Iraqi forces.\\n\\nThere's a lot of middle ground here for military training missions and counterterrorism missions to continue in Iraq if they want to, he said.\\n\\nmustafa.salim@washpost.com\\n\\nSalim reported from Baghdad and Sly reported from Beirut.

{"original": "Foster's playing status remains undetermined, as he will need to be cleared by the NFL before he is allowed to return to the field. He has been placed on paid leave as the league conducts its own investigation into the late-November incident.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe are monitoring all developments in the matter which continues to be under review by the league, an NFL spokesman said in a written statement.\\n\\nThe Redskins claimed Foster off waivers after he was arrested in Tampa on Nov. 24. It was his second arrest for domestic violence in 2018, and while those first charges, filed in California, were also dropped, the Niners released him the morning after the second incident. Two days later, Washington was the only team to put in a waiver claim for Foster. The NFL immediately placed him on the commissioner's exempt list while the league conducted an investigation into the Florida arrest. The NFL's personal conduct policy empowers the league to discipline a player without a criminal charge if it believes such measures are warranted.\\n\\nAdante Pointer, the lawyer for Foster's accuser and ex-girlfriend, Elissa Ennis, said authorities in Tampa informed him Wednesday of their decision to drop the charge.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's disappointing, it's a surprise, and it's just another slap in the face for my client, Pointer said in a phone interview.\\n\\nThe Redskins were heavily criticized for claiming Foster so soon after a domestic violence arrest. Doug Williams, the team's senior vice president for player personnel, released a statement on the night Washington claimed Foster, saying the team would conduct an investigation into the incidents. He later apologized for making insensitive comments when trying to defend the move in a radio interview.\\n\\nTeam decision-makers were said to be divided over whether to claim Foster. An NFL official with knowledge of the Redskins' deliberations about claiming Foster said team President Bruce Allen was behind the move, although Williams and Coach Jay Gruden later said the choice was widely supported among Washington's top officials.\\n\\nAfter being placed on paid leave by the NFL, Foster was allowed to attend meetings and work out at the Redskins' facility but not practice or play in or attend games. He has a locker and a nameplate in Washington's locker room, with the jersey No. 50.\\n\\nThrough a spokesman, the Redskins declined to comment on the dropped charges against Foster.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Redskins have long been intrigued by Foster, who was the 49ers' first-round draft pick in 2017. He starred at Alabama, where he played with several current Washington players and was considered one of the best linebackers in college football. In his rookie year with San Francisco, he performed well, totaling 72 total tackles and a pass deflection in just 10 games.\\n\\nBut Foster's on-field play has been overshadowed by several off-field incidents. He was sent home from the 2017 draft combine after he got into an argument with a hospital worker during a routine medical exam. Last winter, he was arrested in Tuscaloosa, Ala., for marijuana possession. The most serious allegations against him, however, are the charges of domestic violence in which he was twice arrested, in 2018, for allegedly hitting the same woman, Ennis.\\n\\nIn April, prosecutors in Santa Clara, Calif., filed felony domestic violence charges against him only to later drop those charges when Ennis testified that she lied to police about Foster attacking her. The NFL suspended him for the season's first two games for violations of the league's personal conduct policy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis second arrest was at the Tampa hotel on the night before the 49ers played the Buccaneers, after Ennis alleged Foster hit her and knocked a cellphone out of her hand. The Niners released him the next morning.\\n\\nPointer, Ennis's attorney, said the fact that his client testified last year to falsifying a previous domestic violence accusation against Foster — a claim she recently recanted — probably figured into the decision by prosecutors to not move forward with the case. Ennis will cooperate with the NFL's investigation of the incident, her lawyer said.\\n\\nShe's going to have to stand up for herself even when others are unwilling to do it, Pointer said.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the state attorney's office in Hillsborough County, which made the decision to drop the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday."}
{"original": "Not on Tuesday night, however. President Trump, you'll remember, ran for office promising to fix immigration, make good deals and, in general, do a better job than the corrupt, incompetent lawmakers, he said, were wrecking the country. And he was right, they were wrecking the country, said Carlson. And yet, today, in a remarkable twist, the president held a televised meeting with the very swamp creatures he once denounced. He told them he trusted them to craft immigration policy without his input.\\n\\nCorrect: Trump on Tuesday allowed White House reporters to hang out at a bipartisan immigration discussion with Capitol Hill lawmakers. The session impressed the living hyperbolights out of daytime cable television. I'm sure I will get hit for this and I don't really care, said CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash on the cable network. The bottom line is that this is, a year ago, this is the presidency that many people thought Donald Trump was capable of.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat group of people doesn't include Carlson, who saw a belly flop unfold on the White House table. The host highlighted how Trump told the lawmakers, When this group comes back, hopefully, with an agreement, this group and others from the Senate, from the House, comes back with an agreement, I'm signing it. I mean, I will be signing it. Huh?\\n\\nFox News host Tucker Carlson appears to use the same deflection tactic when attacking guests he disagrees with, as Post media critic Erik Wemple points out. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAlso troubling Carlson was the president's apparent position, at the meeting, that he'd sign on to a resolution of the predicament of the dreamers — about 700,000 people who came to the country illegally as children, and who were protected under President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program — without tethering the matter to broader immigration-reform measures. Amnesty for DACA recipients is the only leverage the White House has, ripped Carlson. Once the president agrees to let them jump to the head of the line, ahead of millions of other people hoping to come here legally, the negotiation is over. At that point, why would Democrats agree to anything? Ending chain migration, the diversity lottery, supporting a merit-based system that might actually help America? No chance. (On Twitter, the president issued this walk-back).\\n\\nThe notion that Trump was highlighting his deference to Congress riled Carlson: If these are the same people the president now says he trusts to write the immigration bills, the one he will sign no matter what it says, so what was the point of running for president?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGood question, Tucker Carlson!\\n\\nWith that, Carlson tossed out a year-old MO — playing the anti-anti-Trump card, that is — and went straight after the president. The reason is that Trump's remarkable flexibility bumped up against the closest thing that Carlson has to a substantive core: a hard-line posture on all immigration issues. Time and again, Carlson has demagogued on such issues for his audience, whether the topic at hand is general immigrant crime, an alleged rape at a Rockville, Md., high school or the difficulties experienced by a Pennsylvania community in living alongside a group of Roma immigrants."}

{"original": "Though that voting bloc represents a small percentage of Georgia's 7.2 million registered voters, according to the Secretary of State's office data, election analysts say it's enough to influence outcomes in the two dead heat races and, ultimately, control of the U.S. Senate, during an especially polarizing election season marked by record voter turnout and campaigns that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the hoops that overseas and military voters have to jump through to vote securely from abroad have been complicated by pandemic lockdowns and curfews and mail delays in various countries, as well as Postal Service delays on the U.S. side of the mail chain. Some voters have resorted to paying extra for express delivery through private mail carriers, checking their ballot trackers daily and calling their local elections offices to make sure their ballots arrived. In some cases, ballots mailed a month ago still haven't shown up.\\n\\nGeorgia voters weighed in on the importance of their state's Senate runoff election on Jan. 5. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nSusan Dzieduszycka-Suinat, president and chief executive of Overseas Vote, part of the nonprofit U.S. Vote Foundation, said she's doubtful the steps the U.S. Postal Service has taken to expedite the delivery of mail-in ballots will be enough for overseas ballots to make it in time.\\n\\nWe'll see if that matters, she said in an interview with The Washington Post. I just can't imagine that the debacle in the post office didn't have an impact.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe runoff was triggered after no candidate captured at least 50 percent of the vote in November. Now Republican incumbent Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are locked in tight races with their respective Democratic challengers, the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, at a time when political dynamics in the South are in flux and after the Peach State helped elevate a Democrat into the White House for the first time in 28 years.\\n\\nThe runoff also comes as President Trump's desperate phone call to overturn his loss to President-elect Joe Biden continues to reverberate. On Saturday, he pressed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to flip the race, citing meritless claims of election fraud.\\n\\nTrump specifically referenced the importance of military voters to his campaign during that call, and Republicans are banking on a good turnout from them for the runoff. The nonmilitary voters — most of whom live abroad for family and employment, according to Federal Voting Assistance Program data — tend to sway progressive, buoying Democratic hopes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBoth are affected by delays within the U.S. Postal Service — which is grappling with coronavirus-related staffing shortages and residual holiday season package volumes — on top of already onerous steps to cast votes that will either return control of the Senate to Republicans and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), or a 50-seat to 50-seat tie with Democrats, with Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris able to cast tie-breaking votes.\\n\\nThe significance of the overseas and military vote as decisive in Georgia's election cannot be denied, Dzieduszycka-Suinat said. I still marvel over the fact that the candidates still don't seem to realize that our numbers could impact their elections. I'm waiting for the candidates to address our constituency, meet with overseas and military voters and speak to our concerns. We are weighing in on these elections and now it is undeniable that we can sway the outcome of these tight elections.\\n\\nMilitary and overseas voters automatically received absentee ballots for the runoff election if they received one for the general election, but new voters had to sign up by Dec. 7. All of those mail-in ballots must be postmarked by Tuesday and received by Friday to be counted.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nService members abroad, and their families, use the mail service at their bases, the Military Postal Service Agency, which operates under the U.S. Postal Service. Peter Graeve, chief of plans and policy for the Military Postal Service Agency, told The Post in August that ballots returned by service members, their family and military contractors overseas between Sept. 1 and Dec. 8 would be treated as express mail.\\n\\nDevine Davis recently left her role as a U.S. Army sergeant to travel and now lives with her family in Cuenca, Ecuador, where mail service has been suspended because the country is grappling with the pandemic and financial setbacks. This was the first election season in which she did not vote through the Military Postal Service Agency. She said she relied on shipper DHL for the general and runoff elections, paying the discounted price of $25 to send each ballot to Columbia County, Ga.\\n\\nWe were hearing about voter suppression and a lot of ballots being rejected. The time frame was very tricky for us because it definitely takes longer for our stuff to get the United States, Davis said. It's a lot of work to make sure our vote counts.\\n\\nAccording to Georgia postal workers and mail agency data filed in federal court, mail-in ballot processing for the runoff has run smoothly statewide.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Postal Service reported on-time ballot processing scores of 96 to 98 percent in the Atlanta postal district, the area responsible for more than 40 percent of the state's mail-in ballot requests, since Dec. 29. Postal and election administration experts say the agency should process 97 percent of ballots on-time based on past performance.\\n\\nFigures in the Gulf Atlantic postal district, which serves the region just south of Atlanta and all points east, are just as strong.\\n\\nVoting rights advocates are encouraged by those results, particularly after the dismal scores the Postal Service recorded before the general election. On Election Day, the Atlanta district processed only 81.3 percent of ballots on time, meaning nearly 2 in 10 were potentially caught in postal facilities after the state's ballot-acceptance deadline.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNationwide, at least 150,000 ballots in the Nov. 3 vote — including 1,706 in postal districts that cover Georgia — were caught in U.S. Postal Service processing facilities and not delivered by Election Day, according to agency data. The Postal Service also struggled to track 6,624 mailed ballots in those districts, meaning they were recorded entering processing facilities but not exiting them, due to haphazard expediting procedures.\\n\\nFor the Senate runoff races, the Postal Service faces even stronger head winds than in November. The surging coronavirus pandemic has flattened the agency's workforce, with close to 19,000 postal workers in the U.S. off the job as of Jan. 1 after contracting the virus or close contact to it, according to the American Postal Workers Union. In Atlanta, nearly 2,500 of the district's 15,000 workers were out because of the virus and related agency leave policies, local labor leaders said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the agency continues to struggle with an avalanche of package deliveries from the holiday season that have clogged up the mail stream, leaving prescription medications, bills, and even local newspapers sitting undelivered in postal facilities. The Postal Service delivered only 70.6 percent of first-class mail items on time during the week of Dec. 12, the most recent data available, compared with better than 95 percent during the same period last year. (The Postal Service does not release data on package performance.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Dec. 28, the Postal Service initiated specific measures to expedite mailed ballots leading up to the Georgia runoff election, including processing them as priority mail express, sorting them separately at the processing plants to move them through more quickly and transporting them directly to boards of election to meet the state's deadlines for domestic and overseas voters.\\n\\nThe Postal Service remains fully dedicated to fulfilling our vital role in the nation's electoral process — it has been our No. 1 priority for the past eight months, agency spokeswoman Martha Johnson said in an email. That dedication never wavered, and we took all steps necessary to deliver Election Mail timely and securely. We are equally committed to the timely and secure delivery of Election Mail for the Georgia runoff.\\n\\nMarylouise Serrato, executive director for American Citizens Abroad, which advocates for legislative issues impacting U.S. citizens living and working overseas, said it's critical that this constituency votes — especially because they have to pay U.S. taxes, no matter where they live.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is their voice into Congress, she said. The overseas vote does make a difference, can make a decision in tight elections, and their vote is counted.\\n\\nVote From Abroad, a nonpartisan voter support tool run by Democrats Abroad, encouraged voters to send in ballots by government-run postal mail by Nov. 30. For those mailing their ballots in December, the organization's advice was to use a courier service to avoid mail delays. Both UPS and FedEx encouraged customers to pay attention to their state deadlines when mailing ballots through their services.\\n\\nRepresentatives from Democrats Abroad and Republicans Overseas said their organizations were deluged with requests from voters seeking advice for securing their ballots for the general election. The groups continued their voter education efforts after the November vote, but found that election officials and voters seemed more familiar and confident navigating the system ahead of the January runoff.\\n\\nWendy Gaylord, who lives in Melbourne, forked over $77.13 to send her runoff ballot through FedEx's expedited delivery to ensure it would circumvent Australia's flight restrictions and arrive in Dekalb County, Ga., on time.\\n\\nLaura Merton, a dual citizen living in Toronto, hasn't lived in the U.S. since 1982. This year, she said, her general election ballot took a month to arrive in Chatham County, Ga., so she sent her runoff ballot a month early through a private carrier, paying $22.04, because she was worried about Postal Service slowdowns. According to the county's ballot tracker, her ballot arrived on time but hasn't been officially counted.\\n\\nVoting isn't easy, but I feel like I would walk over coals all the way to Savannah if necessary, she said. Even though I haven't lived in Georgia for a long time, my sense of being an American citizen traces right back to my childhood years in Savannah. Even now.\\n\\nKevin Lee dropped off his ballot the first week of December, mailing it from the United Kingdom through the government-run postal service for about a dollar. But the ballot tracker shows it hasn't made it yet to the Cobb County registrar and he can't get in touch with an election official.\\n\\nI am worried that my runoff ballot won't be received, even though the general election ballot was, he said in an email. While the process was manageable from my end, I feel that being allowed to fax or scan and email would make the process more accessible and efficient for most absentee voters.\\n\\nLike other county electorates, Cobb County Elections and Registration has been wrestling with high mail-in ballot volume to scan, process and verify, which takes time. Janine Eveler, the director of Cobb County Elections and Registration, said in an email that her office has been opening and scanning ballots since Dec. 21."}
{"original": "The commission limited the number of calls debt collectors can make to wireless phones to three a month and barred them from contacting a borrower's family or friends. It also said companies must notify people of their right to request that all calls cease upon request.\\n\\nIt is pretty stressful owing money, and calls from debt collectors nagging you to pay is also very stressful, and when the calls are not just made to you but to your relatives, it's embarrassing, said Margot Saunders, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCompanies that collect student debt payments on behalf of the Education Department, including American Education Services (AES), Great Lakes, Nelnet and Navient, filed a petition in December asking the FCC to reverse course. They argue that the three-call limit is unreasonable and that the FCC does not have the authority to prohibit calls to family and friends.\\n\\nFurthermore, the servicers say the FCC's interpretation of its rulemaking authority under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, a law that bans the use of autodialers to call and text people on their cellphones without permission, is impermissibly broad. That argument might strike a chord with Pai, who as a commissioner dissented against the rules under the same pretense.\\n\\nStill, it is unclear whether the chairman, who was not made available to comment, will side with the loan servicers. Pai has routinely decried robo-calls as a nuisance, and in the same dissenting opinion he said federal contractors should be subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGranting the petition is the right thing to do, said Winfield P. Crigler, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance, which wants the restrictions repealed. Don't be fooled by the empty rhetoric — these calls are only about helping borrowers avoid delinquency and default.\\n\\nCrigler said that sometimes it takes more than a few calls to reach a borrower and that it's critical for loan servicers to have the right to keep trying to help borrowers enroll in the repayment plan that best suits their needs. The FCC, she stressed, undermined Congress's clear intent to help student loan borrowers but added that the new chairman can fix that.\\n\\nIn their petition, the servicers insist that people they frequently contact stand a better chance of remaining current on student loan payments. Nelnet said that calling up to 10 times a month leads to 42 percent more live contacts than calling three times a month and that borrowers the company autodials resolve their delinquency at higher rates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSaunders, of the law center, balked at those results in Wednesday's petition. She wrote that Nelnet's 233 percent increase in calls yields only a 42 percent increase in live contact, evidence that repeated robo-calls produce rapidly diminishing returns that do not justify the harassment.\\n\\nNelnet, AES and Navient are among a handful of companies paid millions of dollars by the federal government to manage payments, answer questions and help people avoid defaulting on their student loans. Their pay is aligned with their performance, so the more people they keep current, the more money they make. But advocacy groups say servicers are exceedingly aggressive in trying to reach borrowers.\\n\\nNavient, for instance, is facing several separate lawsuits from people who say the company called them dozens of times a week. A Georgia man claims he received roughly 3,500 calls from the company over two years, while a man in Florida is suing the company for placing 150 automated calls to his cellphone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPatricia Nash Christel, a spokeswoman for Navient, said the company could not comment on pending legal matters but disagrees with the claims.\\n\\nWe are committed to honoring our customers' communication preferences and helping them to learn about their student loan repayment options, she said.\\n\\nIn 2016 alone, the Federal Trade Commission received more than 3.4 million complaints about robo-calls. Saunders said the volume of complaints could grow exponentially if the FCC dials back its restrictions.\\n\\nIt's not good public policy to allow debt collectors to harass people into paying a debt, Saunders said.

Tarullo is arguably one of the most powerful U.S. banking regulators since Alexander Hamilton, Mills said. Added Ian Katz, financial policy analyst with the research firm Capital Alpha Partners, Tarullo was the most consequential figure in financial regulation in the Dodd-Frank era, and we can't even think of who would be in second place.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTarullo, whose term was not set to expire until 2022, will step down around April 5, according to a statement from the Federal Reserve. In a brief resignation letter addressed to Trump, Tarullo did not explain his departure, but said: It has been a great privilege to work with former Chairman [Ben] Bernanke and Chair Yellen during such a challenging period for the nation's economy and financial system.\\n\\nIn an interview, Tarullo said he began considering when to depart from the Federal Reserve last year and that his decision was unrelated to potential changes coming with the Trump administration. Eight years is a long time particularly at the pace we were at in the middle of the financial crisis, he said.\\n\\nTrump is widely expected to appoint someone to the vacant post of Federal Reserve vice chairman in charge of bank oversight, a position left open during the Obama administration. Tarullo essentially filled that role, but would have probably found his powers and influence curtailed by a Trump-appointee. Trump has promised to dismantle 2010's regulatory reform package, known as the Dodd-Frank Act, signing an executive order last week calling for a review of the rules that govern the financial industry.\\n\\nWe expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, Trump promises (The Washington Post)\\n\\nTarullo has warned against forgetting about the lessons of the Great Recession. There may be refinements that could be made to financial regulations, he said at a conference in December. But I do not think there is a sound economic case for generally weakening the regulatory requirements applicable to the largest banks. And I certainly do not think the taxpayers should bear the risk that would be entailed by any such weakening, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn an interview, Tarullo noted that he has advocated raising the capital cushion banks must keep or simplifying some rules for community banks. As we gain experience with the [new] regulations, we will see opportunities for tailoring, refining them along the way, he said. My hope is that there is a lot of people out there … who share the desire to have much more resilient financial reforms, and want to address the too big to fail problem.\\n\\nWith Tarullo's departure, there are now three openings on the Federal Reserve's seven-member board. Trump will also be filling key openings at other financial regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Taken together, the openings hand Trump has an opportunity to ease Wall Street regulations.\\n\\nDan led the Fed's work to craft a new framework for ensuring the safety and soundness of our financial system following the financial crisis and made invaluable contributions across the entire range of the Fed's responsibilities, Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet L. Yellen said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTarullo has been a fearless fighter for protecting the American people from an unstable financial system, another financial crash and an economic catastrophe, Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a financial markets public interest group, said in a statement. Governor Tarullo has stood steadfast as a sentinel on the front lines of a six-year war to turn the Dodd Frank financial reform law into a reality. Sensibly enacting financial reform so that it would be durably embedded in our financial system will be his legacy. The American people will forever be in his debt."}
{"original": "Generally, the president has vast discretion in issuing visas. One of the major arguments against the executive order is that while in principle a president can limit immigration from the seven affected countries, it would be unconstitutional for President Trump in particular to do so, because in his case the action is motivated by impermissible religious bias. The central exhibit for this argument is his campaign statements about a Muslim ban.\\n\\nWhile the 9th Circuit did not address this at great length, focusing instead on due-process arguments, it did accept the basic validity of the form of the states' argument. The States' claims raise serious allegations and present significant constitutional questions, wrote the court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is absolutely no precedent for courts looking to a politician's statements from before he or she took office, let alone campaign promises, to establish any kind of impermissible motive. The 9th Circuit fairly disingenuously cites several Supreme Court cases that show that evidence of purpose beyond the face of the challenged law may be considered in evaluating Establishment and Equal Protection Clause claims. But the cases it mentions do nothing more than look at legislative history — the formal process of adopting the relevant measure. That itself goes too far for textualists, but it provides absolutely no support for looking before the start of the formal deliberations on the measure to the political process of electing its proponents.\\n\\nA federal appeals court ruled against President Trump's controversial immigration ban that barred refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post)\\n\\nIndeed, a brief examination of cases suggests the idea has been too wild to suggest. For example, the 10th Circuit has rejected the use of a district attorney's campaign statements against certain viewpoints to show that a prosecution he commenced a few days after office was bad faith or harassment. As the court explained, even looking at such statements would chill debate during campaign[s]. If campaign statements can be policed, the court concluded, it would in short undermine democracy: the political process for selecting prosecutors should reflect the public's judgment as to the proper enforcement of the criminal laws. Phelps v. Hamilton, 59 F.3d 1058, 1068 (10th Cir. 1995).\\n\\nThere are sound policy reasons for ignoring campaign statements or promises to shed light on subsequent official action. For one, campaign promises are often insincere, designed to appeal to voters. Indeed, they are explicitly instrumental, and their goal is not policy outputs, but election. Moreover, implemented laws or policies are often substantially different from promises, as is the case here.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven the use of legislative/administrative history, in its most expansive form, looks only at the actual process – and not the personal background of the legislators, let alone before they took office. As the 9th Circuit itself put it in a discrimination case, statements by decisionmakers unrelated to the decisional process itself do not prove a discriminatory motive. McGinest v. GTE Serv. Corp., 360 F.3d 1103, 1138 (9th Cir. 2004).\\n\\nThe 9th Circuit's ruling Thursday throws open a huge door to examinations of the entire lives of political officials whose motives may be relevant to legal questions. This introduces more uncertainty and judicial power into legal interpretation than even the most robust use of legislative/administrative history. Without a clear cutoff at assumption of office, attacks on statutes will become deep dives into politicians' histories.\\n\\nMore broadly, constitutional structure supports examining only executive statements to interpret executive action. When Trump made his most controversial statements, he was private citizen. He had not sworn to uphold the Constitution, or to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. He was, in this sense, a legally differently obligated person. His policies and their relation to the Constitution would presumably be affected by his oath — that is why the Constitution requires it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMoreover, the Constitution's oft-forgotten opinion clause supports disregarding pre-inauguration statements. The Constitution puts at the president's service the officials of the administration and requires they advise him as asked. What it means here is that the president must be seen as the unitary head of the executive branch and the pinnacle of a process of executive decision-making. That process is the only constitutionally recognized executive process. A candidate's possible plans or promises are not part of the process. The opinion clause also suggests a president cannot be bound by the oral statements of federal officials (like Rudy Guiliani), especially when not upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\\n\\nBy accepting the use of preelection statements to impeach and limit executive policy, the 9th Circuit is taking a dangerous step. The states' argument is in essence that Trump is a bigot, and thus his winning presidential campaign in fact impeaches him from exercising key constitutional and statutory powers, such as administering the immigration laws.\\n\\nThis would mean that Trump is automatically disbarred, from the moment of his inauguration, of exercising certain presidential powers, not because of his actions as president, but because of who he is — that is, how he won the presidency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "Distracted driving is something that is very detrimental and causes accidents and deaths and injuries,Hansell said in an interview. And we focus mostly, I think, on cell phones and driving hands free and that sort of thing.\\n\\nIn my experience with Oregon – admittedly a long time ago, as a U.S. Forest Service volunteer in the Eagle Cap Wilderness – there seemed to be a law in place that obliged everyone to travel with a large dog in the flatbed of a pickup. That's not what Hansell has in mind. He acknowledged that he hasn't found any statistics to back up the perception that driving with a pooch in one's lap is dangerous.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI felt it was a kind of policy that made sense, he said. And if we're serious about distracted driving, intuitively it just makes sense that driving with live animals in your lap can be a distraction.\\n\\nAAA, which urges using animal restraints in vehicles for the safety of people and pets, says a lot of people ride with pets and a large number are distracted by them. In a 2011 survey with a pet products company, AAA found that 17 percent of the respondents drove with dogs in their laps. Twenty-nine percent admitted being distracted by a pet, and 65 percent admitted engaging in a distracted behavior with their dog, such by petting it. (Four percent admitted playing with their dog while driving.) In October 2012, a woman and her pet chihuahua were both killed in an accident that the Washington State Patrol says was caused by distracted driving involving the pet, local media reported.\\n\\nSome states have enacted laws intended to protect the driver and some motivated by trying to protect the animal. At least one state, Hawaii, has a standalone traffic law that prohibits driving with a pet on one's lap; New Jersey has a law that allows officers with the New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal to fine drivers traveling with an improperly restrained animal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHansell's bill – whose introduction was reported by The Bulletin in Bend, Ore. — has been filed ahead of the Oregon Legislative Assembly's annual session, which begins Feb. 1.

{"original": "Public health experts differ on how quickly that might happen — and when things might start to feel normal again around the country.\\n\\nTo inaugurate our first Health 202 of the new year, we asked eight experts for their predictions.\\n\\nAfter all, we all want to know when we can go to concerts and ballgames again. Or even just go to the office. (Let's start small.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe asked two questions. The first has to do with when the United States will reach herd immunity — the point at which enough people are immune to a virus, either by recovering from it or getting vaccinated against it. Herd immunity generally kicks in when about 70 percent of people are immune, although experts differ on the precise threshold.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo reach herd immunity with the coronavirus, approximately 230 million Americans would need the vaccine. As of yesterday, just 4 million had gotten the first of two shots. Daily immunizations have increased considerably over the past few days, with about 500,000 people getting the shot each day, but experts say that number needs to at least double and ideally quadruple.\\n\\nWe also asked these experts when they personally expect their lives to return to normal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere are their responses, edited lightly for clarity and brevity.\\n\\nWhen will enough Americans be vaccinated for the U.S. to reach herd immunity, based on how things look right now?\\n\\nCarlos del Rio, professor of medicine and global health at Emory University:\\n\\nAt the current pace it will take a really long time. … I think if we can get our act together and start vaccinating 1 million people a day like President-elect Biden is promising, then we can get to 260 million people getting at least one dose … more or less or by late August or early September. If we really scale up and get to 3 million per day, then we can get to 260 million people in [less than] 100 days or three months. Can we do it? Yes! But it will require coordination, leadership and funding. So, as you see, my answer is: It depends.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEric Topol, director and founder of Scripps Research Translational Institute:\\n\\nI think by July, if we get 2 to 3 million people vaccinated per day, and even sooner, if we have a rapid neutralization antibody assay to be able to defer those who have had a prior infection and mounted a durable immune response. Yes, that is optimistic, but it can be done.\\n\\nJay Bhattacharya, professor of medicine at Stanford University:\\n\\nThere is a lot of disagreement in the scientific literature about the herd immunity threshold, which is certain to vary from place to place. I don't think anyone responsible would confidently say what it is, and would never put forward a single number for the U.S. as a whole. Rather, the key question is how rapidly we inoculate people who have a high risk of mortality conditional on infection — most older folks and some late middle-aged folks with severe chronic conditions. Prioritizing them for vaccination will yield the greatest benefit in reducing covid-19-related mortality, regardless of when herd immunity is hit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJesse Goodman, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Georgetown University:\\n\\nI am not sure that in the near future we will reach a level of population immunity where the virus will be virtually shut down, as we are accustomed to with measles. Through immunity due to vaccination, combined, unfortunately, with infections in the unvaccinated, we should reach a state where the risk of exposure is reduced due to a mostly immune population. While cases will still occur, our health system will no longer be stressed and large outbreaks should be less common.\\n\\nI am hopeful we can get to such a situation in the last quarter of this year, provided vaccine production, access and acceptance go well and no mutant viruses arise that gain the ability to escape current vaccines.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKimberly Powers, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat question is difficult to answer, as there is considerable uncertainty around the level of immunity we would need in the population to achieve herd immunity, along with the speed with which we can expect widespread vaccine uptake to occur.\\n\\nLeana Wen, public health professor at George Washington University and former Baltimore health commissioner:\\n\\nRight now, vaccine distribution is progressing at an unacceptably slow speed, and at this current rate, it will take years to reach herd immunity — if ever. If we are able to pick up speed by many times in January, there is still a chance we could substantially slow down the infection and perhaps approach herd immunity in 2021.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at Harvard University:\\n\\nI think you mean 'will enough Americans be vaccinated to reach the herd immunity threshold?' My answer is possibly not because we don't know if the vaccines protect enough against transmission for the threshold to be achievable, and because the new variant may increase that threshold substantially.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMichael Osterholm, chairman of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota:\\n\\nThere are three factors that will independently determine when enough Americans will either be protected from covid-19 via vaccination or development of antibody following actual infection.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFirst, when will there be sufficient vaccine produced and distributed so everyone can receive their two doses? This includes vaccinating those who may have immune protection from actual infection but are vaccinated anyway to increase durable protection. Second, will enough people agree to be vaccinated? And finally, what is the durability of vaccine-induced protection over time?\\n\\nEach of these factors will play a role in achieving local, regional or national herd immunity protection. I feel confident we can achieve the first factor of sufficient vaccine by the late summer or early fall. But ultimately, the second two factors, how many will be vaccinated and how durable is immune protection will determine the answer to this question. I hope, when considering all three factors, it will be late summer or early fall, but we all realize hope is not a strategy.\\n\\nWhen do you expect your own daily life to feel similar to pre-pandemic times?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarlos del Rio:\\n\\nI am hoping to be 'close to normal' by December 2021 more or less. However, as a physician seeing patients, I will probably continue to wearing a face mask and goggles for much longer.\\n\\nEric Topol:\\n\\nIn 2022.\\n\\nJay Bhattacharya:\\n\\nGiven the changes that the previous year has had on my professional and personal life, I do not expect my daily life to ever feel similar to pre-pandemic times. More broadly though and given the disappointingly slow roll out of the vaccine to the vulnerable in many states, I anticipate that American society will start to feel more like normal by April 2021.\\n\\nJesse Goodman:\\n\\nHopefully late this year, life should begin to feel similar to pre-pandemic times. However, it is likely that both great vigilance and some social distancing will still be needed, particularly if the population is not nearly all vaccinated. In addition, we may well require periodic immunization against the current and, possibly, other emerging coronavirus variants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKimberly Powers:\\n\\nI expect daily life to feel more normal by sometime this summer, but I think it will be 2022 before some mitigation measures can be fully relaxed. And I expect that our society will feel ongoing consequences of this pandemic — physical, mental, emotional, and economic — for years to come.\\n\\nLeana Wen:\\n\\nI don't know. I was much more optimistic a few weeks ago. But given the lag in vaccine rollout thus far and how under-resourced our public health systems are, I am concerned things for much of 2021 will feel more like 2020 than 2019.\\n\\nMarc Lipsitch:\\n\\nI think that sometime in the second half of the year there will be enough vaccination in the U.S. and some other countries that we will begin to treat covid-19 more like seasonal flu, which is deadly to large numbers of people but does not overwhelm health care and does not cause us to curtail normal social contact. This is because with enough vaccine in those at high risk of death and hospitalization, transmission may continue (at a reduced level thanks to some immunity in the population from prior infection and vaccine) but the outcomes will be less severe.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMichael Osterholm:\\n\\nI'm not sure it ever will. We will not go back to a pre-covid-19 normal. We will instead exist in world with a new normal. And even that will in part be determined by the availability of adequate vaccine supply to cover everyone in high, middle and low income countries. I look forward to the day when my office hours are as they were pre-covid-19.\\n\\nAhh, oof and ouch\\n\\nAHH: Federal official says the U.S. may cut its Moderna doses in half to stretch the shots further.\\n\\nOperation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui said Sunday the administration was in talks with Moderna and the Food and Drug Administration about giving people two half-doses of Moderna's vaccine.\\n\\nSlaoui told CBS's Face the Nation that giving half-doses to people between the ages of 18 and 55 triggers the same immune response as two full shots of the recommended 100 microgram dose and would allow officials to immunize twice as many people with the vaccine currently available. Any changes to the vaccine doses would ultimately require FDA approval.\\n\\nSlaoui described two half-doses as a more responsible approach compared with stretching out the time between shots. Health officials in the United Kingdom have said that they are aiming to get a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine to as many people as possible, even if it means delaying the second shot in the two-dose regimen.\\n\\nThe impetus to rethink recommendations comes as vaccine distribution falls far short of the Trump administration's prediction that 20 million people would be vaccinated by the end of December.\\n\\nAnthony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert, has cautioned against changing vaccine protocols, arguing that the emphasis should be on improving distribution.\\n\\nOOF: Top health advisers are pushing back against Trump's claim the coronavirus death toll is exaggerated.\\n\\nYesterday, Trump tweeted that the U.S. numbers on coronavirus cases and deaths are far exaggerated compared with other countries.\\n\\nThe numbers are real, Fauci said during an interview with NBC's Meet the Press. Go into the trenches, go into the hospitals, go into the intensive care units and see what is happening. Those are real numbers, real people and real deaths.\\n\\nMore than 350,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the United States this year and more than 20 million cases have been recorded.\\n\\nSurgeon General Jerome M. Adams also defended the numbers, although he declined to comment directly on Trump's statement. From a health perspective, I have no reason to doubt those numbers, Adams said on CNN's State of the Union.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly made baseless claims aimed at shedding doubt about the severity of the coronavirus, but health experts say the official coronavirus statistics match closely with excess mortality data showing many more people dying in 2020 than would be expected in a normal year.\\n\\nOUCH: A new variant of the coronavirus is more transmissible.\\n\\nA new variant of the coronavirus, originally identified in the United Kingdom, has been spreading around the globe, and a growing body of evidence suggests that genetic mutations have made it more transmissible. The United States has reported infections from the new variant in California, Colorado and Florida.\\n\\nPublic health officials have reassured the public that the new variant does not appear to be more deadly or cause people to get sicker, and they say the leading vaccines will still be effective against it. But the Atlantic's Zeynep Tufekci argues that a more transmissible virus may be far more dangerous than a more deadly strain due to the mathematics of exponential growth, as each new infected person infects more people. With vaccinations lagging, a new variant could be potentially catastrophic.\\n\\nTake a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections — a plausible scenario for many European cities, Zeynep writes, based on an analysis conducted by Adam Kucharski, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. As things stand, with those numbers, we'd expect 129 deaths in a month. If the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. In contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month — assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.\\n\\nInitial estimates suggest that the virus could be 50 to 70 percent more transmissible, although there's still much that we don't know about the new variant. It could turn out that the transmissibility has been overstated and that the dominance of the virus in the U.K. is due to chance or changed behavior among people.\\n\\nBut the United States may not have time to wait for better data before it acts. It appears that the new variant is still rare in the United States, but that could change quickly. For exponential processes, small initial differences can mean gargantuan differences in the long run, Zeynep writes. We are in a race against time, and the virus appears to be gaining an unfortunate ability to sprint just as we get closer to the finish line.\\n\\nSome experts fear vaccines may be less effective against strains of the coronavirus that were first found in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nCoronavirus latest\\n\\nChicken plants where the Trump administration approved faster line speeds were more likely to have virus cases.\\n\\nA Washington Post analysis found that poultry plants that received waivers to increase the speed of their slaughter lines were 10 times more likely to have coronavirus cases than plants without waivers. Since 2018, the Trump administration has issued waivers to 54 poultry plants allowing them to increase the line speeds by 25 percent. Fifteen waivers were approved during the pandemic.\\n\\nWorkers say the fast line speeds make it difficult, sometimes impossible, for them to socially distance during their eight-hour shifts as they struggle to work faster. Most of these plants are also large, employing thousands of workers who work in tight quarters, creating conditions that can fuel the spread of the virus, The Post's Kimberly Kindy, Ted Mellnik and Aurelis R. Hernández report.\\n\\nThe analysis is based on data from the nonprofit Food and Environment Reporting Network, which has documented more than 51,000 coronavirus infections among workers in beef, hog and poultry plants and 347 deaths.\\n\\nThe USDA is working to finalize a new rule that would make the increased line speeds permanent and expand them to other poultry plants, although it is unclear if the administration will be able to push the change through before Joe Biden takes office. Critics worry that such a rule change could harm worker safety even beyond the coronavirus. Carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis and other illnesses are common among people who work in meatpacking plants.\\n\\nMismanagement by the D.C. mayor and the intransigence of teachers' unions have kept schools closed in the District.\\n\\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) was determined to reopen schools this fall. But changing plans and communication shortcomings on the part of the city, and shifting, hard-line demands on the part of the union, kept schools closed for months, squandering the chance to return the most vulnerable students to the classroom while infection rates were low, city officials, union leaders, educators and activists told The Post.\\n\\nAs urban school districts across the country struggled with classroom reopening plans, a close look at the District's experience shows how hard it has been to develop workable strategies — and how much power teachers wield, particularly when they have a strong union behind them, our colleagues Perry Stein and Laura Meckler report.\\n\\nThe District's impasse meant it squandered the chance to give its most vulnerable children classroom time while infection rates were low, they write. Now the earliest any students will have face-to-face instruction will be February. Meanwhile, children are falling behind.\\n\\nColorado discarded its recommendation to vaccinate prisoners early.\\n\\nA revised version of Colorado's vaccination plan no longer lists incarcerated people for priority vaccinations after an earlier plan, which put them ahead of the elderly and those with chronic conditions, sparked a political backlash, The Post's Isaac Stanley-Becker reports. Accusations that politicians were coddling convicted murderers while the law-abiding elderly went without vaccines caught fire on social media and made their way into newspaper editorials and on Fox News.\\n\\nA spokesman for Gov. Jared Polis declined to make the governor available for an interview but issued a statement defending the state's plan, stressing the moral obligation to prioritize elderly people most at risk of dying from the virus and front-line health-care heroes caring for the sick.\\n\\nInmate status will not make a difference in terms of timing of receipt of the vaccine, the spokesman said. Someone who falls into a category for early priority of the vaccine and is in custody will receive the vaccine at the same time as someone in the same category who is outside our correctional facilities.\\n\\nColorado's new vaccination plan also no longer lists people living in homeless shelters. Some experts say they are troubled by the decision to no longer prioritize vaccinations in congregate care settings. More than 40 of the 50 largest clustered outbreaks have occurred in jails or prisons, according to an article in the Lancet.\\n\\nMore on the coronavirus vaccine\\n\\n\\n\\nEven as millions of vaccines finally flow into hospitals and health departments, many Americans are confronting overwhelmed health systems. Some counties and hospital systems launched websites for vaccine reservations, only to find them immediately booked or crashed. A Florida health department that offered vaccines to older residents on a first-come, first-serve basis found people lined up in lawn chairs, The Post's Brittany Shammas and Lori Rozsa report.\\n\\n\\n\\nPregnant women are agonizing over whether to get coronavirus vaccines. While health experts anticipate that the coronavirus vaccines, like most other vaccines, are probably safe for pregnant women and less dangerous than contracting the virus, they have not been tested and there is no safety data available. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said that vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant or lactating women, leaving the decision up to patients and their doctors, The Post's Frances Stead Sellers reports\\n\\n\\n\\nIndia approved two vaccines — the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the homegrown Covaxin — in preparation for a mass vaccination campaign. The country aims to administer vaccinations to 300 million people in the first phase, The Post's Niha Masih reports"}
{"original": "Pullbacks of such magnitude are relatively common and usually occur over a two- to three-month period. But the jarring plunges over the past two weeks — on Thursday the Dow tumbled nearly 500 points in a mere 30 minutes before the closing bell — are beginning to reshape sentiment on Wall Street. Some analysts are predicting darker, more volatile times ahead.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStocks plunged again on Feb. 8 in another trading session with big swings, as equities remained in a tug-of-war with bond yields. (Reuters)\\n\\nThe declines, if they persist, and the fear they would generate could have ripple effects on the economy, which is performing solidly in the United States and abroad. When people see massive losses in their brokerage accounts or 401(k) retirement plans, they tend to lose confidence and spend less.\\n\\nInvestors also are growing concerned that inflation is rising, which is compelling central banks to raise interest rates. That makes it more expensive for companies and consumers to borrow, hampering actual economic activity.\\n\\nTen percent is no small potatoes, said Chris Rupkey, an economist with MUFG Union Bank. It's a big number. That loss of wealth is going to take a toll on overall spending in the economy both for businesses and individuals.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRegardless of whether the market continues on its downward trajectory — a much more menacing bear market looms if stocks fall 20 percent — many analysts said the past two weeks of dramatic drops, rapid rises and followed by more heart-pounding dives have already made a distant memory of the blissful and steady multiyear rise in stocks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne factor that may have contributed to Thursday's sell-off were remarks by the Bank of England, which said it might have to raise interest rates earlier and by a somewhat greater extent than it had thought.\\n\\nThat reinforced to markets that the easy-money policies put in place by central banks during the global recession a decade ago are coming to an end. Instead, policymakers will be raising interest rates to keep inflation in check.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThursday's losses wiped out all of the gains for the year for the Dow and the S&P 500. The Dow dropped 1,032 points to close at 23,860.46 — the second time it has lost more than 1,000 points over the past week.

Bonds are safer but often return less money than stocks.\\n\\nYou don't want to move too much too soon into bonds, Coupe said. You don't want to be caught in fixed income as rates are moving up. That's why everybody is going back and forth. We haven't had inflation, and now we have it and everyone freaks out. Be careful what you wish for.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury bond touched a four-year high before falling back to 2.83 percent. A 3 percent yield is looked upon by investors as a sign that investors are fleeing the risk of stocks for the relative safety of bonds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is a lot of concern in the rising yield in the 10-year Treasury note, said David Kass, professor of finance at the University of Maryland. As it approaches 3 percent, concerns about inflation and competition for stocks by fixed-income securities are increasing.\\n\\nSome believe the 3 percent yield is inevitable. Bond yields are rising as the Federal Reserve trims its U.S. bond holdings and pulls back on its easy-money policies. The Treasury is also having to borrow more money, partly because of recently enacted tax cuts.\\n\\nSome analysts stressed that the economy remains strong, noting that the markets are fickle and have long been vulnerable to fears of what is to come.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIndeed, several companies reported strong earnings Thursday, a pattern that is expected to continue throughout the year.\\n\\nSocial-media company Twitter posted its first profit, and Yum Brands, Cardinal Health and Tyson Foods also exceeded earnings expectations. Nearly 80 percent of companies that have reported so far in this earnings season have surprised analysts to the upside.\\n\\nWhen the market declines sharply, everyone naturally wonders 'What's wrong?'  said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. Nothing is wrong economically. The economy is doing better now than it has any time in the past decade. This is just some healthy, and overdue, volatility to wring out any excess.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLPL Research released a report titled Volatility is Back, which pointed to fear of rising interest rates as the source of the recent swings, but cautioned that the economy is fundamentally strong.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe primary culprit was higher-than-expected wage growth in the January jobs report, which may have increased fears that the Federal Reserve would be more aggressive with interest rate hikes in 2018, according to LPL. However, the selling pressure unmasked a variety of issues, including investor complacency and the difficulty of unwinding crowded and complex trades involving leverage, or borrowed money."}
{"original": "In a recent post, leading federalism scholar Rick Hills argues that foot voting in a federal system can't work effectively without major help from ballot box voting. He agrees that foot voting has many of the advantages I emphasize, but contends that it might be futile if ballot box voters cannot incentivize politicians to continue good policies:\\n\\nUnless there is a feedback mechanism inducing local officials to care about attracting migrants, we argue that interjurisdictional migration will be nothing more than a trip from the frying pan to fire. Foot-voters would either over-crowd the good jurisdictions or not bother moving at all, because they would have no guarantee that well-governed destinations would stay well-governed. This does not mean that foot-voting is pointless: It just means that migration should be regarded as a complement to ballot-voting, not a substitute. Ilya's argument for foot-voting, in other words, becomes much more powerful if one recognizes that foot-voting actually improves local ballot-voters' incentives to cast an intelligent vote. One such incentive is the prospect of foot-voters' buying their houses. Our criticism is offered, therefore, more as a friendly amendment than a refutation to Ilya's outstanding book.\\n\\nI greatly appreciate Rick's praise of my book, and I certainly agree that we cannot dispense with ballot box voting entirely. Well-informed ballot box voting can make a federal system function much better than it would otherwise. Rick outlines several plausible mechanisms by which foot voting can reinforce ballot-box voting, and vice versa. But effective foot voting is not as dependent on ballot box voting as Rick suggests.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI. The Danger of Killing the Goose that Attracted the Golden Egg.\\n\\nIt is indeed true that foot voting does not provide guarantees against the reversal of the policies that attracted the foot voters in the first place. What a state or local government gives today it could potentially take away tomorrow. Government officials with poor incentives might end up killing the goose that attracted the golden egg of foot-voting migrants in the first place.\\n\\nBut the risk is not as great as Rick suggests. Even if the governments in question are just selecting policies at random and do not care about their effect on foot voters, there is still a great deal of inertia in government, especially when it comes to changing long-established policy. Interest groups, bureaucracies, and others who have become habituated to the status quo will not easily accept change. If a policy has been in place for a long time, that is some evidence that it is unlikely to be radically altered in the short to medium term future.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMoreover, at least in a system where subnational governmments must raise a large proportion of their own funding, they do in fact have strong incentives to adopt policies that attract foot voting taxpayers and businesses. Otherwise, they risk losing valuable tax revenue that can be spent on projects they value, or on efforts to help keep them in power. Additional tax revenue is valuable to officials even if voters remain poorly informed and do not directly reward them for it. If nothing else, it can be useful in enriching the officials themselves and their political allies. Thus, competition can incentivize local and regional governments to cater to the needs of foot voters, even in the absence of electoral pressure to do so.\\n\\nII. Crowding and Capitalization.\\n\\nAs Rick indicates, crowding might at some point limit the ability of foot voters to enter attractive jurisdictions. However, such effects need not be a major problem in a system where there are hundreds or even thousands of jurisdictions competing with each other. While some may become crowded, others will not. Moreover, crowding is not a fixed fact of nature, but often the effect of policy. It can be mitigated by changing such policies as excessively restrictive zoning, which artificially limits the amount of housing available to potential migrants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe danger of artificially inflating land prices through zoning makes me skeptical of Rick's and Qiao Shitong's proposal to incentivize good policy by rewarding local officials for increasing the relative value of the land within their jurisdiction. As Rick himself has emphasized in other work, high prices often reflect exclusionary zoning rather than good policies.\\n\\nLike some other scholars, Rick worries that foot voting may become pointless if the benefits of good government become capitalized into the value of land: housing in well-governed jurisdictions becomes more expensive to the point that there is no benefit to moving there from poorly governed ones. In my book Democracy and Political Ignorance, I explain why this concern is overstated.\\n\\nCapitalization does not happen nearly as quickly as critics fear. If it did, we would not have had a long history of migration from poorly governed areas to relatively better ones. If capitalization were all that it is sometimes cracked up to be, we would never have had the recent migration of northerners to the Sun Belt or the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the Jim Crow South. The relative advantages of these destination areas should have immediately been reflected in higher prices that would deter migrants in the first place. In addition, as noted above, capitalization effects can be diminished by adopting policies that make housing more available and thereby reduce the costs of migration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFinally, in a world where instantaneous capitalization does occur, we might indeed see little or no migration driven by foot voting. But the mere possibility of it is still likely to incentivize local governments to adopt better policies As I put it in my book:\\n\\nIf local governments get a substantial proportion of their revenue from property taxes—as most in the United States do—they would have incentives to adopt policies that increase the value of land within their jurisdiction so that they could generate more revenue without raising tax rates. In such a scenario, the possibility of in-migration would serve to bid up prices, even if (by assumption) the changes in price occur so quickly that migrants are deterred from ever actually coming. Indeed, the faster the increases in price happen, the faster local governments will be able to reap the benefits of better policies in the form of higher property tax revenue.\\n\\nI certainly do not contend that foot voting can solve all our problems, or that ballot box voting has no useful role. To the contrary, I have argued that foot voting cannot effectively address such issues as overexploitation of immobile assets by subnational governments, most notably property rights in land. For that reason, a system of decentralized foot voting needs to be supplemented with constitutional protections for property rights, for other immobile assets, and for people with unusually high moving costs. Also, I recognize that there are some problems so large that they cannot realistically be dealt with at the regional or local level, and therefore must be addressed by national or even international ballot box voting."}
{"original": "Facebook followed, blocking the president's account for the first time for 24 hours for what it said were two policy violations, although it didn't threaten permanent suspension. It also said it was blocking his Facebook-owned Instagram account.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe social media giants' actions were the strongest volleys after a year of heightened tension between Silicon Valley and Trump. They came after months of struggling to combat baseless allegations of a stolen election long stoked by Trump and his allies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump belatedly called for calm on Twitter as the riot at the Capitol earlier Wednesday halted a process to certify Joe Biden as the next president. But his plea came in a now-removed video that was itself laced with disinformation, and he shared the message only after most of the mob had been pushed outside the building — leaving a trail of online and offline discord in his wake.\\n\\nAs the mob of Trump supporters stormed the House and Senate, their compatriots online celebrated the chaos, cheering the violence across a wide array of social media sites and calling for bloodshed in the days ahead.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe real-world violence forced lawmakers into a lockdown and raised new questions about whether social media sites, including Facebook and Twitter, have acted swiftly and aggressively enough to rein in the dangerous rhetoric from Trump and his allies at a critical juncture for the future of U.S. democracy.\\n\\nAmid the onslaught of criticism, Facebook took the rare step of removing Trump's video after hours of internal debate about the president's actions, before blocking his account entirely. YouTube also removed the video, while Twitter similarly took aim at Trump throughout the day, flagging tweets that sent mixed messages about the events that had unfolded.\\n\\nThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, Trump said in a tweet since removed. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe saga began in the morning, when Trump urged his followers to march to the Capitol at a rally during which his attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, earlier called for a trial by combat. Trump later took to social media to attack Vice President Pence for failing to overturn the results of the election on Trump's behalf.\\n\\nThe president's online and offline rhetoric ultimately emboldened a supportive mob later to breach the building, halting the House and Senate's work and forcing Pence's evacuation. The president soon returned to Twitter to encourage his supporters to stay peaceful — but he did not ask them to leave until he did so in a video uploaded to the site later in the afternoon.\\n\\nPlease support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement, he tweeted. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!\\n\\nThe president's words also reverberated far beyond Twitter, where he boasts more than 88 million followers, and other more traditional social media platforms. Trump supporters on lesser-known sites have spent months egging on what they've called a second civil war against Democrats and the deep state. Many have boosted QAnon and other conspiracy theories suggesting that an uprising of covert military forces or civilian militias could help secure Trump's presidency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe storming of the Capitol on Wednesday led many of those accounts to celebrate — and call for further violence. As the jarring images of the rioting appeared on television, the pro-Trump forum TheDonald.win hosted an online watch party, with thousands providing commentary and sharing live-stream video links of the blitz.\\n\\nTHIS IS WHY TRUMP CALLED US TO DC TODAY! STORM THE [expletive] CAPITOL!!! said the top-voted comment from user RedWhiteBlue15. You fight now or get thrown into a camp later. … They are going to take EVERYTHING FROM YOU INCLUDING YOUR HUMANITY!\\n\\nOn Parler, a social media site popular with Trump supporters, some posters encouraged more violence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDisappointing. Pelosi, Schiff, Nadler, Schumer, Romney all got away, wrote one poster. DC is a target rich environment. Hope to see some of the DemonRat residences getting torched. Antifa knows how to do it. Learn from them.\\n\\nThe episode marked Trump's latest attempt to weaponize Twitter in the days after his defeat. Since Election Day, the president has attacked Biden, rejected his victory, floated widely disproved allegations about voter fraud and stirred his supporters to act. The antagonism — much of it meted out with few repercussions from social media companies — culminated in the dramatic confrontation Wednesday at the Capitol, which forced the District of Columbia to mandate a curfew and summon the National Guard.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's not the first time Trump's social media activity has threatened to incite real-world violence. Seven months ago, for example, the president responded to racial justice demonstrations in Minneapolis by attacking those in attendance as thugs and predicting that looting might lead to shooting. That tweet prompted Twitter to discipline the president by blocking the tweet from view for essentially glorifying conflict. In the run-up to the election and its aftermath, the company covered up hundreds of tweets from high-profile accounts, including dozens from Trump.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCritics including Democratic lawmakers soon called on the company to suspend the president's account, repeating their long-held belief that Silicon Valley should stop Trump from spreading harmful misinformation at viral scale. But Twitter at the time said its policies allow world leaders to share their views unfettered, a view the company has maintained even as Trump has intensified his rhetoric.\\n\\nThe company's refusal to remove Trump on Wednesday prompted Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, to blast Trump for having promoted sedition and incited violence. He also called on Twitter and other social media companies to suspend his accounts ASAP as they would do for anyone else advocating disinformation and promoting violence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Wednesday alone, Twitter labeled eight of Trump's tweets as in dispute. In the face of growing pressure, it escalated its response by blocking retweeting and liking of the labeled tweets, as well as the ability to reply to them. Twitter then outright blocked two of Trump's tweets.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt Facebook, meanwhile, employees earlier in the day began pressuring company leaders to take action. They tagged Facebook executives in posts on the company's internal chat system, asking for a statement from leadership and for the video to be taken down. Do we really want Facebook to be a platform that enabled the second civil war, an employee asked, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.\\n\\nSeveral pro-Trump accounts on Twitter sought to blame the chaos on antifa, sharing baseless theories that followers of the far-left protest movement were dressed as Trump supporters and causing havoc everywhere. One message retweeted more than 3,000 times said, Now who ACTUALLY wears all black and attacks law enforcement?? ANTIFA ACTORS!!! These are NOT Trump supporters attacking Capitol Police!!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther Twitter accounts that promote Trump and QAnon voiced glee over the Capitol breach. Wow, this movie is getting better and better. My popcorn is running out already! I need more! said one QAnon-backing account.\\n\\nJoan Donovan, the research director at Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, said the breach at the Capitol followed weeks of online agitating from Trump's supporters who peddled the idea that they needed to Stop the Steal — and disrupt vote-tallying efforts nationwide.\\n\\nThis is the consequence of calling for a very wild protest, as Trump had tweeted last month, and it's going to lead to some serious harm, she said.\\n\\nMuch of the online fury Wednesday centered on Vice President Pence, who some Trump supporters had hoped would deliver an implausible saving grace by refusing to certify Biden's victory.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter Pence said he would not intervene, Lin Wood, the Trump-allied attorney who has pushed to overturn the election, tweeted a baseless allegation that Pence is a TRAITOR, a Communist Sympathizer & a Child Molester. Lock him up. The tweet, which has not been flagged by Twitter, has been retweeted 15,000 times.\\n\\nQAnon believers also shared images and video clips of Trump supporters smashing glass and storming the police surrounding the Capitol. One well-known QAnon figure, a shirtless man known as the Q Shaman, could be seen in photos of the crowd inside the building after it had been breached.\\n\\nOn Parler, a site that prides itself for its lack of content moderation, the extremist group known as the Proud Boys celebrated the mayhem in Washington.\\n\\nDoesn't look like they're destroying the capital, one user affiliated with the group wrote. Looks like they're liberating it. God bless America and all her patriots.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUsers on 4chan, another online message board popular among Trump supporters, similarly cheered the mobs that overtook the Capitol. Users there described the mayhem as the American Revolution 2.0″ and threatened what they described as tyrannical Democrats and traitors.\\n\\n[I hope] they are all dragged outside and executed one by one in front of the camera, after being forced to admit their [sic] wrong doing for the world to see. Hanging is too good for demons, read one post, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks right-wing extremism."}

Instead of finding more qualified candidates, they're doubling down and trying to roll the Senate.\\n\\nRepublicans argue Trump's nominees have faced unwarranted resistance from Senate Democrats, whom they accuse of trying to run out the clock on many of the president's picks, and say most remain worthy of consideration. Trump himself has repeatedly complained about Senate Democrats, calling them good at obstruction.\\n\\nUnder Senate rules, a single member can object to a nomination being carried over into the new year. About 150 Trump nominees drew no objections in December, but an unusually large number — nearly 90 — were sent back to the White House at the end of the year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll but 14 of those have been renominated by Trump. Most of those nominees had previously announced their plans to withdraw or had been voted down by a Senate committee, including three picks for the federal judiciary and Scott Garrett, Trump's choice to lead the Export-Import Bank. He had voted to eliminate the agency as a member of Congress.\\n\\nOthers who publicly exited include Sam Clovis, Trump's nominee to become the chief scientist at the Agriculture Department.\\n\\nClovis, who has no experience in the hard sciences, withdrew his name from consideration in November amid revelations he was among top officials on the Trump campaign who were aware of efforts by foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to broker a relationship between the campaign and Russian officials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nControversial Trump nominees face a narrower path in the Senate this year. With the arrival of Democrat Doug Jones from Alabama, the GOP now holds just 51 seats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Republican consultant with close ties to the White House said one reason Trump has renominated even some of his more controversial picks is a sense of loyalty.\\n\\nMost of these are being held up by Democrats, said the consultant, who requested anonymity to speak more candidly. If some of them are being slow-walked, that doesn't necessarily mean they should be abandoned.\\n\\nAmong the more high profile re-nominations is that of McFarland, a former deputy national security adviser and close ally of Michael Flynn, Trump's ousted national security adviser who is now cooperating with the special counsel in the Rusisia probe.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcFarland's first nomination in May stalled amid concerns about her knowledge of contacts between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials.\\n\\nMcFarland, a former Fox News commentator, testified in July she was not aware of any of the issues or events related to Flynn's contact with Sergey Kislyak, the former Russian ambassador to the United States. Emails obtained by the New York Times in December showed McFarland was aware of a key exchange between Flynn and Kislyak.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRichard Grenell, Trump's nominee for ambassador to Germany, is also being re-upped for consideration despite resistance from Democrats. Grenell, a former diplomatic aide to President George W. Bush, is a frequent Fox News commentator and outspoken critic of the media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlso renominated this week was Kathleen Hartnett White to lead the Council on Environmental Quality, an agency that coordinates environmental efforts across the administration.\\n\\nWhite, a former Texas regulator who once called carbon dioxide a harmless trace gas that was merely plant food, was grilled at her confirmation hearing about her qualifications and past statements on climate change. In November, more than 300 scientists wrote to the Senate opposing her appointment.\\n\\nAfter the White House re-upped White's nomination on Monday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) assailed her on Twitter.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy question is: why in the world would @realDonaldTrump renominate Kathleen Hartnett White to chair the Council on Environmental Quality after her disastrous nomination hearing in November?? he wrote. She is wildly unqualified to serve in this position — she outright rejects basic science.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHer nomination has also been vigorously opposed by environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, which called her dangerous in a tweet this week.\\n\\nNASA, meanwhile, has been without an administrator since Charles Bolden resigned a year ago. It took nine months for the White House to nominate Jim Bridenstine, a Republican congressman from Oklahoma, who faced withering questioning from Democrats at his Senate confirmation hearing late last year.\\n\\nSen. Bill Nelson, a former astronaut and influential Democrat from Florida, led the charge against Bridenstine, calling into question his credentials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNelson said the NASA administrator should be a consummate space professional who is technically and scientifically competent and a skilled executive, as well as someone who can unite people — criteria he said Bridenstine lacks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring his tenure in Congress, Bridenstine has focused on space issues, including sponsoring an expansive bill known as the American Space Renaissance Act. He has also been endorsed by Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon.\\n\\nStill, Bridenstine's path to confirmation remains tricky due to concerns voiced by some Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who said he does not want to see the politicization of NASA. During the 2016 presidential race, Bridenstine appeared in ads on behalf of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and suggested Rubio, then a White House candidate, was soft on terror.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOthers on Trump's list this week include former Republican congresswoman Ann Marie Buerkle of New York to chair the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a five-member panel responsible for regulating thousands of other products.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBuerkle, who has been a member of the commission since 2013 and now serves as its acting chairwoman, was the subject of a New York Times story late last year with the headline: Trump Pick to Head Consumer Safety Board Is Seen as Too Close to Industries.\\n\\nThe piece reported that she has seldom voted for a mandatory recall, a maximum fine or a tougher safety standard.\\n\\nOthers with an uncertain path in the Senate who were renominated this week include Sam Brownback, the Republican governor of Kansas, whom Trump put forward in July as his pick to be ambassador at large for international religious freedom. He has faced resistance from Democrats related to his record on LGBT rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's list of resubmissions also includes two nominees to the federal judiciary rated not qualified by the American Bar Association.\\n\\nThe ABA concluded Charles Goodwin, Trump's nominee to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, is unqualified because of his work habits. And, the ABA said Holly Teeter, Trump's nominee to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, is not qualified based on her lack of trial court experience. Among other things, Schiff has drawn criticism for his blogging, including a post in which he called Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy a judicial prostitute.\\n\\nWhite House officials have accused the ABA of being politically biased in its rankings.\\n\\nThe fate of two other Trump judicial picks remains unclear.\\n\\nDamien Schiff and Stephen Schwartz — nominated last year for the Court of Federal Claims — were not on this week's list of those getting a second shot in the Senate."}
{"original": "In this new piece, Lamb-Sinclair writes about the experience she and other Teachers of the Years had when they were honored at the College Football Playoffs National Championship game in Tampa earlier in January, and why teachers are too often misunderstood by the public. At a time when teachers have been unfairly blamed for poor student performance by federal and state officials, the piece has special resonance. (Her Twitter handle: @AshleyLambS)\\n\\nBy Ashley Lamb-Sinclair\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy husband and I were taking an Uber recently while in Tampa, Florida, and we engaged the driver in obligatory small talk. My husband told the driver that we were there for the College Football Playoffs National Championship game because as Kentucky Teacher of the Year, along with the other state teachers of the year, I had been invited by The College Football Foundation and the Council of Chief State School Officers to represent the teachers across the nation by standing and being recognized on the 50-yard line at halftime.\\n\\nHe seemed impressed, going so far as to announce my presence to the attendants as he pulled up to the hotel to drop us off, but added so automatically that it made me stiffen in my seat, Well, how do we get the other teachers to be like you then, huh? Because, well, most of 'em are just terrible.\\n\\nI gave an awkward laugh, we thanked him, and got out of the car. But as I prepared for events that evening, I couldn't shake his words. The truth is that I am one of the lucky ones. The hours of planning and grading, the almost anxiety-producing passion for my work, and the years of standing in front of young people to help them grow into productive adults led me to stand on the fifty yard line at the College Football Playoffs National Championship game and wave to a cheering crowd as a representative of the work that many teachers do.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut what the Uber driver didn't know, what the fans in the stadium and watching on television didn't know, and what, sadly, many Americans don't know, is that the work of a teacher is really, really hard and does not come down to the sound bites one often hears about what works and what doesn't in public schools.\\n\\nThe narrative that public schools are failing, teachers are widely ineffective, and that politicians and business people are the ones to fix all of these problems can sound more compelling than the truth. And the image of what makes a great teacher can be so narrow for the average person, that many of those fans may not have even known the realities each of us faced that led us to that moment on the field. So here is the truth: America saw 50 or so excellent teachers standing on the field at halftime, but what happened behind the scenes is just as powerful.\\n\\nTeachers never stop teaching and advocating.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt 10 a.m. on a Monday morning, the hotel bar was already populating with sports fans wearing crimson and orange, depending on their team. But in the middle, circled up, were 30 or so state teachers of the year meeting to outline plans for developing an organization to protect public schools and its students. In December, we pulled together to create a video campaign with the help of Roman Lane Productions and Curio Learning (an education technology startup I co-founded) and planted the seeds for an organization called Protect Public Ed. While others spent the morning preparing to tailgate, we spent ours planning call campaigns to senators, determining a timeline for upcoming initiatives, and coordinating our various state efforts in order to support each other's work. We have no budget, no agendas, and no organizations to whom we are required to report. We met together, then shared our story with a local reporter until the final minutes of boarding the bus to the stadium, and messaged each other all evening and into the next day about how to further our work.\\n\\nWe are not unique in this effort. In my own state of Kentucky, my colleagues Tiffany Gruen, Brison Harvey, and Kari Patrick work tirelessly without additional pay to manage a website (www.kyedpolicy.org) and coordinate efforts in our state for teachers and legislators to work together on education policy. And then they go into the classroom and do amazing work with students. I could name example after example of teachers just like them; teachers who advocate for students inside and outside school walls, all the time.\\n\\nTeachers never stop giving to students.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs we entered the stadium, the attendants handed each person a gift card. It only took a few minutes for word to spread among our group that the gift card was to Donors Choose, a nonprofit that helps teachers get materials they need for their classroom. Considering the level of budget cuts to education occurring in many states, the impoverished students that many teachers teach and love, and the fact that the average teacher spends $500 to $1,000 per year of personal money on school supplies, we were thrilled to discover that the College Football Foundation was investing in classrooms and giving sports fans the opportunity to give to local teachers and students.\\n\\nThen we realized that some people were throwing them away. We found them on the ground and in trash cans. So when the stadium cheered for us on the field, they had no idea that many of us had been literally digging in the trash during the first half in order to find ways to help our students. Most teachers appreciate the recognition of a job well done when we get it from students, parents, and citizens.\\n\\nBut what also matters is recognizing how each individual can improve the well being of students and teachers within local schools. Giving on Donors Choose is a place to start. Another is paying attention when education funding is cut by local, state, and national governments. No professional adult should be digging in a trash can to do his or her job well. And no child should go without proper resources for learning and thriving either.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTeachers band together to do what is best for each other and kids.\\n\\nWhen we left the field, we huddled around the lovable and kind New Mexico Teacher of the Year, David Morales, who spoke to us about the work we had done over the course of our year together and the work that we will continue to do going forward. There was not a dry eye among us, and not because we were sad to walk off the field and lose the title or the recognition. We were crying because we had built something together. We had shared in each other's work.\\n\\nTeaching can often feel isolating, so for teachers from across the United States to come together and share experiences, combine forces, and collaborate was truly powerful. We have sat together in rooms at the White House to discuss education policy. We have shared stories of our students and helped each other figure out ways to best help them. And we have stood together in recognition as a powerful force of change agents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat our Uber driver didn't understand is that we are not the only ones. We are not unique in our excellence. There are teachers in public schools in every state giving their best to students and advocating for our profession. It felt energizing to stand on the field and be recognized not for myself, but for every one of those powerful teachers in classrooms who weren't there."}

Despite reports to the contrary and false narratives surrounding the Syria decision, we are not going anywhere, a senior administration official said Friday in a briefing for reporters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nU.S. strategy was thrown into confusion last month, when President Trump announced the immediate withdrawal of some 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. For the past three years, those forces have advised and directed Syrian Kurdish fighters who, with the aid of U.S. airstrikes, have driven the Islamic State out of most of its Syrian strongholds.\\n\\nTrump's decision followed a Dec. 14 telephone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in which they agreed that Turkey should take charge of the anti-Islamic State fight and management of territory seized from the militants.\\n\\nBolton subsequently enshrined the new policy in a classified memo directing the departure of U.S. military forces from Syria and shifting of responsibility to Turkey, said a person familiar with the process. That person, along with several U.S. and foreign officials, spoke about the still-unsettled situation on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nWhether U.S. airstrikes in Syria will continue at their current pace, in the absence of direct American guidance to ground forces of the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, is one of a number of unresolved issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn an update issued Friday, the U.S. Central Command listed a total of 469 strikes conducted against the Islamic State in Syria between Dec. 16 and 29. For now, our policy remains the same, a military official said, although adjustments are expected as the troop withdrawal is undertaken.\\n\\nBolton will be accompanied to Turkey by Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and James Jeffrey.\\n\\nJeffrey, a former diplomat who last summer was appointed special administration representative for Syria engagement, was named Friday to replace Brett McGurk as the envoy to the global anti-Islamic State coalition. McGurk and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced their resignations last month in protest of Trump's Syria withdrawal decision.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPentagon and State Department officials are skeptical that Turkish forces are capable of combating the Islamic State, whose reduced forces are now far into southern Syria near the Iraqi border, or that Turkey will prioritize the militants over its stated desire to eliminate the Kurdish YPG forces.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTurkey considers the YPG a subsidiary of the Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party, which both Ankara and Washington have designated a terrorist organization. It has objected from the start to the U.S. use of the Syrian Kurdish fighters as the primary ground force in the U.S. efforts against the Islamic State. Turkey's complaints have grown as territory cleared of the militants has been left in the hands of the YPG, which has declared a Kurdish enclave along the Turkish border.\\n\\nLast month, even as he was negotiating with Trump, Erdogan said Turkish troops and their Syrian opposition allies were mobilized along the northeastern Syrian border and ready to attack if the United States did not disarm and remove the Kurds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe threatened invasion has been postponed, Turkish officials said, until departing U.S. troops get out of the way. Erdogan expects to learn the timetable for their withdrawal during Bolton's visit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile Trump has been said to have extended his initial 30-day deadline to four months, we have no timeline for our forces to withdraw from Syria, said one of four senior administration officials who participated in the briefing for reporters Friday. They spoke on the condition of anonymity under White House rules for the briefing.\\n\\nThe president has made the decision that we will withdraw, and we are formulating the plans to do that right now . . . in a deliberate and heavily coordinated way, but we will be leaving.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's agreement with Erdogan comes as the administration is seeking to resolve a number of issues with Turkey, a NATO ally. Late last month, the United States approved a $3.5 billion sale of Patriot surface-to-air missiles to Turkey, hoping to head off Ankara's purchase of a Russian air defense system.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, Pompeo's trip to the region will take him to at least eight countries, including all six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman — as well as Egypt and Jordan.\\n\\nAsked about reports from the region that the administration hopes to have Arab troops go to Syria, a senior administration official said that we're exploring a variety of options — I won't go into details on those — but we don't have any plans right now to facilitate Arab forces going into Syria.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn addition to clarifying U.S. staying power in the region, an official said that Pompeo would continue his work on galvanizing our regional partners and allies to counter the [Iranian] regime's destabilizing activities.\\n\\nOfficials said Pompeo also plans in Saudi Arabia to bring up the case of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed by Saudi agents inside that country's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Trump has resisted U.S. intelligence conclusions that the killing was likely ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSaudi officials said this week that 11 people, who have not been identified, are on trial in Riyadh for the killing, and that the death penalty is being sought for five of them.\\n\\nIn Egypt, Pompeo plans to deliver a speech on administration policy in the Middle East. While declining to provide details, an official said that the secretary's going to speak about America as a force for good in the region."}
{"original": "How candidate positions were compiled\\n\\nThe Washington Post sent a detailed questionnaire to every Democratic presidential campaign asking whether it supports various changes to U.S. economic policy. Candidates with similar stances were organized into groups using a combination of those answers, legislative records, action taken in an executive role, and other public comments, such as policy discussion on campaign websites, social media posts, interviews, town hall meetings and other news reports and surveys. See something we missed? Let us know.\\n\\nThis page will update as we learn more about the candidates' plans. We also will note if candidates change their position on an issue. At initial publication, this page included major candidates who had announced a run for president.

{"original": "In an interview with 60 Minutes that aired Sunday, though, she offered an opinion that, although unusual historically and for an elected official in Washington, should not be considered surprising.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez was being interviewed by Anderson Cooper, who asked what she meant when she said that Trump was a symptom of a problem.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president certainly didn't invent racism, she replied. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.\\n\\nDo you believe President Trump is a racist? Cooper asked.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah. No question, Ocasio-Cortez said.\\n\\nHow can you say that? Cooper replied.\\n\\nWhen you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy, she said. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's — it's night and day.\\n\\nOn this, Ocasio-Cortez's opinion is positively mainstream.\\n\\nA year ago, the Associated Press and its polling partners at NORC asked Americans the same question Cooper posed to Ocasio-Cortez. Nearly 6 in 10 Americans said they thought Trump is racist, including a wide majority of black Americans.\\n\\nWhat's more, most Americans held that view strongly, with 46 percent of Americans saying they felt strongly that Trump is racist.\\n\\nIn July, Quinnipiac University released a poll with slightly better numbers for the president — but with about half the country still holding the belief that the president is racist.\\n\\nWhat's important to note about that poll, though, is that Americans who share Ocasio-Cortez's politics and heritage — Democrats and Hispanics — overwhelmingly believe that Trump is racist. Nearly 9 in 10 Democrats think he's racist, while 6 in 10 Hispanics agree.\\n\\nThis is not new. In a Suffolk University poll conducted shortly before the election, well before the incidents cited by Ocasio-Cortez as evidence of Trump's racial views, about half the country (including most Democrats and Hispanics) thought he was racist. Remarkably, even 7 percent of Americans who planned to vote for Trump thought he was racist.\\n\\nThat July poll from Quinnipiac also got to Ocasio-Cortez's first point about the dog whistles of white supremacy. In that same poll in which Americans were split on Trump's racial views, a clear majority believed that his presidency and rhetoric had given oxygen to racists.\\n\\nRemarkably, more than a fifth of Republicans thought that Trump emboldened racists, even though, in the same poll, only 11 percent disapproved of his presidency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBear in mind that these polls are all months old, predating the fight over the U.S.-Mexico border wall and Trump's midterm-campaign focus on migration (including that notorious ad implying that migrants approaching the border were dangerous criminals). But, then, the Suffolk University poll in 2016 lines up fairly well with the Quinnipiac University poll from July, suggesting that views of Trump on race have been reinforced, not altered, by his presidency."}
{"original": "Furthermore, Donald Trump was elected at a time when the tools of coercive economic statecraft seemed to be more than meets the eye. Through its centrality in global economic networks, the Trump administration was confident that it could get its way with allies and adversaries alike.\\n\\nTwo stories came out Wednesday suggesting that the administration believed it had achieved multiple triumphs. According to my Washington Post colleagues John Hudson and Souad Mekhennet, the Trump administration sideswiped its European allies on Iran: If they refused to call out Tehran and initiate an arcane dispute mechanism in the deal, the United States would impose a 25 percent tariff on European automobiles, the Trump officials warned, according to European officials familiar with the conversations. Within days, the three countries would formally accuse Iran of violating the deal. As Hudson and Mekhennet note, this is an unprecedented use of coercive threats against treaty allies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere was also all the jazz surrounding the signing of the phase one trade deal with China, a 96-page agreement that commits China to buy $200 billion more in American products over the next two years. My Post colleague David J. Lynch notes, correctly, that Trump's China bargain is the most concrete expression of his enthusiasm for 'managed trade,' which relies on government fiat to guarantee key results. His approach, also evident in deals with South Korea, Mexico and Canada, is a striking departure from generations of U.S. trade gospel.\\n\\nThese news stories sound like a big shock wave. As it turned out, however, both of these revealed less of a coronation than bad comedy.\\n\\nConsider the economic pressure story first. It would be easy to infer that Trump's economic pressure had the desired effect — except that, as Hudson reports, it seems as if the best that could be said is that the threat of economic pressure did not ratchet up tensions even further. U.S. officials acknowledged to Hudson and Mekhennet that Europeans had been signaling their intention to trigger the dispute resolution for weeks. What was the effect of this pressure? Officials in Britain, France and Germany say that they had planned to initiate the mechanism but that Trump's threat nearly caused them to backtrack, out of concern that they could be viewed as stooges of Washington if word of the threat leaked.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo, at best, the threat of sanctions did not undercut U.S. diplomacy. At worst, by talking to the news media about this, the Europeans are priming to say no the next time Trump tries this thundercracker of a stunt. And he is guaranteed to do that.\\n\\nAs for the China deal, the agreement seems more like a truce designed to not make things worse as the United States enters an election year. My Post colleague Heather Long points out: From a short-term perspective, the deal doesn't seem so great. China's additional purchases make amends for only a fraction of the trade war's hit to the economy, analysts say. And the bulk of the purchasing in the deal could have happened in the summer of 2018 without Trump ramping up tariffs.\\n\\nThe Council on Foreign Relations' Brad Setser is probably correct when he notes that China is going to deliver on those commitments where it has agreed to steps that are in its self interest, but not much more. & by doing so, it will raise the stakes of trying to enforce the deal in those areas where it isn't delivering. Politico's Megan Cassella notes that there is increasing frustration among some American businesses and technology companies who feel Trump is trading away hard-earned leverage in exchange for an agreement that does little to resolve the systemic issues that led the White House to begin imposing tariffs against China two years ago. To sum up: The Trump administration's bargaining posture is highly dubious."}
{"original": "Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of Serum Institute of India Ltd., the world's largest vaccine maker by volume, wants indemnity. Competitors tripping up one another by instigating frivolous civil suits isn't a trivial risk for the likes of Poonawalla, who's manufacturing the jab developed by AstraZeneca Plc and Oxford University. It could get messier still because some healthcare systems may experiment with dosage quantities and intervals to deal with mutations. Who will be responsible if there are serious adverse side events then? No insurer will underwrite the risk; the burden of compensation will fall on states or, in the case of poor countries, on Covax, a global initiative to ensure equitable distribution.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn current estimates, Covax can meet only a fifth of global demand by the end of the year. So countries that are striking direct agreements with producers will still have to worry about potential tort claims, which seek civil remedies — and not just for the next year or two. The virus may stick around even after universal immunization, with mutant strains creating an enduring market for jabs long after Covid has ceased to be a public health emergency.\\n\\nManufacturers, distributors and other entities in the United States are very likely to find their Covid-19 products and services moving across borders, according to RAND Corporation researchers. Their legal exposure in foreign courts is thus uncertain, especially given the rapid pace of vaccine development and limited data about side effects and long-term consequences.\\n\\nGoing by past pandemics, this data won't start showing up for a while. When it does, it will likely vary by country, which affects how liability is handled. In 2013, four years after swine flu hit the globe, the U.K. government reversed its stand on the safety of the Pandemrix jab made by GlaxoSmithKline Plc, after a major study showed that it was associated with narcolepsy. Affected individuals could apply for compensation. At the time, the health department noted that the decision to recommend that children got this vaccine during the flu pandemic was based on evidence available at the time, along with the advice from the European Medicines Agency which approved its use. It then said that the department keeps all emerging evidence under review, which is why usage stopped in 2011 for those under 20. The data evolves, muddying potential liability issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt gets more complicated. Rich countries are buying up large doses of viable vaccines from Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. Many are now weighing turning over a portion they have secured to low- and middle-income nations facing delays as Covax hasn't worked out as planned. The European Union, for instance, is considering donating 5% of its inoculations, Reuters reported. With altruistic gifts, it's even harder to assign responsibility.\\n\\nDuring the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, the World Heath Organization came up with a multi-country liability shield, as RAND researchers describe it, or a global legal framework. Recipient countries had to sign a letter of agreement that basically allowed donors to wash their hands of liability, or indemnify donors, as long as they followed WHO standards. The issues were knotty and some countries didn't have the resources to interpret them. Eventually, of the 94 countries that were interested in donations, 87 signed the agreement and only 78 completed the preconditions in the agreement for vaccine supply.\\n\\nThe complexity of the current situation and the sheer scale of production mean a new agreement will be required. National governments will need to negotiate, consider and approve various requirements – all long processes. If disparities between countries crop up, manufacturers will face barriers to production and distribution. The alternative is national compensation funds, which honor claims for those who have suffered adverse effects from the vaccines. Many countries simply can't afford these, further reinforcing the resource and investment imbalance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPrevious widespread illnesses like small pox and other influenzas show that liability issues can hinder progress of new vaccines, even domestically. In 1976, as the Ford administration took on an ambitious program to vaccinate millions against an anticipated outbreak of swine flu, insurers and manufacturers balked. Their concerns around legal exposure prompted Congress to pass a law waiving liability. Through legislation, the U.S. was substituted as the defendant in lawsuits against any vaccine manufacturer, distributor or American entity providing free inoculation. Although that flu scare didn't evolve into a full-blown pandemic, firms in the U.S. are now effectively protected. Such a legal setup isn't standard in most other places.\\n\\nAn additional challenge this time around is the space race-type international competition in vaccine development. China and Russia are promoting inoculations with little or no data validating their effectiveness in large studies. India has licensed an indigenous product developed by local firm Bharat Biotech International Ltd. in clinical trial mode — those receiving the shots will be tracked and that will supposedly prove its efficacy. That's because phase three experimental data, which do exactly that, aren't yet available.\\n\\nAll this is too breathtaking a pace for scientists. Policy makers in developing nations may not have a choice but to take what they can get — easily, cheaply and quickly. But in so doing, they might just be storing up legal troubles for later.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\\n\\nAnjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

{"original": "We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved, Trump told the crowd to whoops and loud cheers, falsely claiming that President-elect Joe Biden's victory was based on fraudulent vote counts. We won this election, and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election.\\n\\nHe said Republicans had to keep fighting and urged a crowd of aggrieved supporters to mount an insurrection against constitutional order on Wednesday, encouraging what quickly became a mob assault on the U.S. Capitol carried out in his name. The fabrications were familiar, but this time, Trump's angry rant amounted to a call to arms.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a long and violent day that the president urged his followers to remember forever, he was typical Trump. He exhorted his followers, he spoke falsehoods, he took to Twitter, he attacked the media, and he confronted the Constitution of the United States. It was as if four years of the Trump presidency were squeezed into one day. In the twilight of his presidency, Trump was where he always yearns to be — in the middle of the vortex, at the center of attention in a broken nation.\\n\\nLater Wednesday, Trump appeared to sympathize with the mob and to explain away the violence as the natural consequence of his election loss to Biden. He also edged close to celebrating the day's events.\\n\\nThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, he tweeted. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTwitter said later Wednesday it had locked Trump's account for violating its rules.\\n\\nThe sight of rioters, some armed, trying to overturn an election marked an unprecedented but not entirely unexpected reaping of what Trump has sown.\\n\\nHe incited violence. He abdicated his responsibility to lead, and he failed to quell violence at the Capitol. It's straightforward, said Tom Bossert, who was Trump's first homeland security adviser.\\n\\nJulian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said the day's events were a very predictable result of Trump's rhetoric but without presidential precedent.\\n\\nThere is no parallel. This is a president who has incited a mob insurrection against Congress as it's trying to finish its constitutional duties, Zelizer said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMost of the rioters shown on television smashing their way into the Capitol were wearing Trump regalia. Many shouted his name or proclaimed the conspiracy theories he has told them about unsubstantiated election fraud, saying it robbed him of a victory in the Nov. 3 election.\\n\\nEven many Trump supporters were aghast. A number of aides resigned, including the first lady's chief of staff, a spokeswoman and the White House social secretary, officials said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne senior administration official, who said they had considered resigning but decided against it because there were only two weeks left in Trump's term, called it the worst day of his presidency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nToday totally undercut all of the accomplishments of the last four years, the senior administration official said. It's incredibly sad. There is nothing else to say about it. It's the worst day I've had in here.\\n\\nFormer Trump communications director Alyssa Farah, who left the White House last month, tweeted directly to her old boss.\\n\\nCondemn this now, @realDonaldTrump - you are the only one they will listen to. For our country! she wrote.\\n\\nFormer White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney also publicly called for the president to do more.\\n\\nGOP lawmakers bombarded White House staffers on Wednesday afternoon with pleas to get Trump to speak out more forcefully against the group, according to two White House officials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhite House officials and allies had struggled to persuade Trump to condemn the mob, said several people familiar with the discussions. Like others interviewed for this report, they spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the events.\\n\\nAs he watched television, Trump spent much of the afternoon fuming about Vice President Pence instead of worrying about the violence in the Capitol, even lambasting Pence while he was in a secure location, trying to remain safe from the mob. Pence said earlier in the day that he would not intervene to change the outcome of the election.\\n\\nIt took several hours and entreaties by phone and Twitter from Republican allies, former White House employees and other Trump allies before Trump released a video message directly addressing the violence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn it, Trump sympathized with his violent followers and perpetuated the false claims about a stolen election that had incited the mob in the first place. He did not blame his supporters or disavow them.\\n\\nI know your pain. I know you're hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side, but you have to go home now, Trump said gently.\\n\\nWe have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anybody hurt.\\n\\nBy that time a woman had been fatally shot and several officers injured.\\n\\nEarlier, Trump had urged the rogue militants to remain peaceful as television scenes played out of officers being overrun.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has always been reluctant to condemn violence, racism or falsehoods perpetrated by his political followers or members of like-minded organizations. From the deadly protest in Charlottesville in 2017 to the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and the recent rise of the Proud Boys group, Trump has repeatedly equivocated or declined to condemn violence and antidemocratic actions on the political far right.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA senior White House aide said Trump wanted his supporters to swarm the Capitol and protest loudly all day. There was no plan for them to go inside, this official said. If you'd had told me this morning that the Capitol was going to be attacked like that, I would have laughed at you.\\n\\nAs for the rally itself, Trump was unhappy with the staging, which had the crowd spread out over two large expanses of lawn and held back from a raised stage area.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump told aides he was pleased so many had come to Washington but was angry that the crowd was not closer to him, a senior administration official said. During his speech, Trump griped that the news media got the best seats in the house.\\n\\nOn Monday and Tuesday, the president spent extensive time discussing with aides the Save America rally on the Ellipse, even discussing what songs should be played and how fiery his remarks should be.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn recent days, Trump has plotted with others how to get revenge against anyone who did not go along with him, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\\n\\nPolicy doesn't animate him. Revenge animates him, said an adviser who had recently spoken with the president.\\n\\nTrump has been fixated on overturning the election for weeks, making hundreds of calls to allies, lawyers, state legislators, governors and other officials and regularly huddling with outside lawyers Rudolph W. Giuliani and Sidney Powell, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and others.\\n\\nSome aides have tried to persuade Trump that he should lay off Pence, who is loyal, but Trump doubled down. He lashed Pence by name a half-dozen times during Wednesday's address to the crowd, all but calling him a coward.\\n\\nTrump, who was 30 minutes late, told the crowd he had just spoken to Pence ahead of his ceremonial role presiding over the congressional action.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so, because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election, Trump said. All Vice President Pence has to do is recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.\\n\\nThe Trump supporters who became insurgents had come to Washington at his urging, to demonstrate against congressional certification of Biden's victory on Wednesday.\\n\\nTrump said he would walk with the crowd to the Capitol, although in the end, he did not. Many in the large and boisterous crowd set off for the Capitol before he had finished speaking.\\n\\nHe spent much of the more than one-hour speech angrily denouncing fellow Republicans he said had failed him by not objecting to the pro forma congressional action. Trump promised to primary the hell out of members of Congress who would not support his efforts to overturn the election results, whom he called weak Republicans and pathetic.\\n\\nPatty Binkley, 66, was among those who left early and headed for the Capitol.\\n\\nWe've heard all that stuff before, Binkley, who arrived by car from Tennessee, said as she was pushed in a wheelchair while Trump continued to speak. We thought he was going to come out and say something new.\\n\\nNot long after Trump spoke, the very lawmakers he had implied were traitors were fleeing the floors of the House and Senate, and Pence was whisked to a protected area.\\n\\nPence then expressed outrage.\\n\\nThe violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now. Anyone involved must respect Law Enforcement officers and immediately leave the building, Pence tweeted shortly after 3:30 p.m.\\n\\nPeaceful protest is the right of every American but this attack on our Capitol will not be tolerated and those involved will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\\n\\nWhite House aides said they received no guidance about the day, other than an email that the White House Mess, a Navy-run cafeteria, would be closing because of a citywide curfew.\\n\\nThe West Wing has largely been empty in recent days, with only Meadows and a couple of others as constants, while others have tried to stay away. Most aides are working from home.\\n\\nA number of advisers and aides, including many who have been loyal to Trump for years, are increasingly despondent and embarrassed by his conduct. Many officials are no longer coming to work, two administration officials said.\\n\\nHe can't admit that he lost. He would literally do anything in the world, one official said."}

{"original": "At the same time, the commission said it shared Perry's stated goal of strengthening the resilience of the electricity grid and directed regional transmission operators to provide information to help the commission examine the matter holistically. The operators have 60 days to submit materials. At that time, the agency can issue another order.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPerry's proposal favored power plants able to store a 90-day fuel supply on site, unlike renewable energy or natural gas plants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe plan, however, was widely seen as an effort to alter the balance of competitive electricity markets that federal regulators have been cultivating since the late 1980s. Critics said it would have largely helped a handful of coal and nuclear companies, including the utility FirstEnergy and coal-mining firm Murray Energy, while raising rates for consumers.\\n\\nThe Commission's endorsement of markets does not conflict with its oversight of reliability, and the Commission has been able to focus on both without compromising its commitment to either, the FERC said in an order.\\n\\nPresident Trump applauded his administration's energy policy at a rally in Pensacola, Fla. on Dec. 8. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe FERC said while it had not used the term resilience, it had pursued policies that would ensure the uninterrupted supply of electricity in the face of fuel disruptions or extreme weather threats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPerry issued a statement saying as intended, my proposal initiated a national debate on the resiliency of our electric system.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut most analysts saw the decision as a setback for the administration.\\n\\nThis outright rejection of subsidies for coal and nuclear shows that Commissioners of both parties have little interest in manipulating electricity markets in favor of any fuel source, said Paul Bledsoe, a former consultant at the Obama-era Energy Department, now a lecturer at American University's Center for Environmental Policy.\\n\\nThe law and common sense prevailed over special interests today, John Moore, director of the Sustainable FERC Project Coalition, said in a statement. The FERC correctly found that the Department of Energy's proposal violated the basic requirements of the Federal Power Act. Secretary Perry's plan would have subsidized coal and nuclear plants with a 90-day fuel supply yet Perry never explained why those plants were inherently more reliable or resilient.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough the FERC could issue a new order after submissions by regional grid operators, the language in the current order suggested it would stand by the trend toward free competitive electricity markets.\\n\\nThis is really FERC saying that any change we make to the grid is going to be grounded in fact, Greg Wetstone, president of the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in an interview. This is shifting to a real-world process based on what's actually happening to the nation's grid, and that's great news for renewable energy.\\n\\nPerry had argued that coal and nuclear power plants would fare better in extreme weather such as the polar vortex that gripped large parts of the nation just four years ago. Yet opponents of Perry's plan said the current bout of extreme cold undercut Perry's argument as regional grids had excess power on hand and many power plants switched from natural gas to oil largely because of cheaper prices. One of the few major outages was the result of a failed transmission line that took a New England nuclear plant offline.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe FERC order issued Monday included three members' concurring comments that revealed some difference of opinion beneath the unanimous vote. Cheryl LaFleur, a Democrat, said even had a resilience issue been demonstrated, I have serious concerns about the nature of the proposed remedy, which would address the issue not through market rules but through out-of-market payments to certain designated resources. She said Perry's proposal sought to freeze yesterday's resources in place indefinitely.\\n\\nBy comparison, Neil Chatterjee, a Republican and former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), wrote in his separate comments that I applaud Secretary Perry's bold leadership in jump-starting a national conversation on this urgent challenge, and expressed concern about the many nuclear and coal units particularly at risk of economic retirement despite their significant contribution to bulk power system resilience.\\n\\nChatterjee said he would have preferred an interim step in response to Perry. He said the FERC order to seek more information about resilience was only the first step rather than a final one."}
{"original": "This was the workshop of sculptor Edward Virginius Valentine. Though he missed the Civil War while studying art in Europe, Valentine returned home to the ruins of Richmond in 1865 and shaped the way generations would view that era of American history.\\n\\nToday, the artist's studio is closed to visitors at the Richmond museum that bears his family name — the Valentine. But museum director Martin and others see the workshop as the center of what could be a public reckoning with the racist mythology that Valentine's sculptures helped bring to life.\\n\\nWorking in virtuous white plaster, then recasting for the ages in stone or bronze, Valentine created heroic images of fallen Confederate leaders that defined the Lost Cause. Nearly a century after the artist died in 1930 at the age of 91, his creations are drawing as much attention as when they were first unveiled before multitudes — but for different reasons.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Lee statue that recently came down from Statuary Hall at the U.S. Capitol was a Valentine. The figure of Confederate President Jefferson Davis that protesters hauled from its pedestal on Richmond's Monument Avenue in June was a Valentine — and its copy came down from a square in New Orleans in 2017.\\n\\nNow the Valentine museum has petitioned the city of Richmond to let it display the Davis statue from Monument Avenue — not in its former glory, but tipped over, dented and covered with paint from protesters.\\n\\nActually bringing that statue back to the spot where it was created has a unique power to it, Martin said. When you think about the creation of the Lost Cause myth — it was built around this particular spot in this garden at the Valentine.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe power of that myth is what protesters confronted in Richmond and other Southern cities all summer, after the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis triggered national demonstrations for racial justice.\\n\\nProtesters in Richmond tore down a statue of the Confederacy president Jefferson Davis on June 10. (Dylan Garner/Richmond Times-Dispatch via Storyful)\\n\\nUnder that version of history, the prewar South was a land of magnolias and chivalry where women were belles, men were noble cavaliers and Black people were happy to be enslaved. It was no coincidence that the Lost Cause took root in the post-war years of Reconstruction, undercutting social advances and shackling Black Americans to bad jobs and poor schooling for another century.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nValentine literally did some of the work to make these ideas tangible, said Josh Epperson, a consultant based in Richmond working with the museum to rethink its mission. Epperson, who is Black, has hosted brainstorming sessions over the past few months with diverse community members, including social activists and business leaders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNot all were thrilled about the idea of giving the toppled Davis monument a new home, arguing that even in its diminished state, it glorifies the old ideologies. The reaction showed just how much raw feeling and raw pain there is still attached to those objects, Epperson said.\\n\\nBut he found that all the community members were really interested in folks dealing directly with who benefited from these narratives of the Lost Cause, which includes, obviously, the Valentine family.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe name was already prominent before the sculptor became well known. Edward's brother, Mann S. Valentine II, earned a fortune through a product called Valentine's Meat Juice — which was exactly as it sounds and proved excellent at nourishing wounded soldiers during the war and restoring weak constitutions after.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMann Valentine founded the museum in 1898, stocking it Smithsonian-style with collections of odd fossils, rocks and Indian artifacts. Over time, it became dedicated to the history of the city.\\n\\nEdward Valentine had his studio in a nearby carriage house, which after his death was relocated to the grounds of the museum. When he returned from years of studying under noted sculptors in Europe, Valentine began executing works for what was left of Richmond society.\\n\\nHe created likenesses of presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, including the Jefferson that still stands in the lobby of Richmond's Jefferson Hotel. Lee visited his studio in 1870 to have his face measured; in 1873, Davis returned for the same reason to the capital he had fled eight years before.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCurators at the museum are digging deeper into Valentine's character, combing through his journals to learn more about his personal views. But there are at least two clues in his work. One is that Valentine never created likenesses of President Abraham Lincoln, even though that might have been a hot-selling product.\\n\\nAnd the other is that some of Valentine's most popular images were depictions of Black people that seem openly exploitative. A young boy who unloaded coal for Valentine's studio was immortalized as The Nation's Ward, a bust with exaggerated features that Martin said fit into the demeaning tradition of pickaninny caricatures. Another subject was Henry Page, who had been enslaved by the Valentine family and was depicted as the kindly, smiling Uncle Henry — akin to an Uncle Tom figure.\\n\\nWhen Page died in 1886 at 101, his obituary appeared in the local newspaper, and his pallbearers included White members of the Valentine family as well as Black men. What that says about the complicated relationships of the day, Martin said, is something the museum hopes to learn more about.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPart of what we want to do with the studio interpretation is really humanize Henry Page. He was a man, said Christina Vida, the museum's curator of general collections.\\n\\nAnother goal is to explore the social consequences of such damaging symbols.\\n\\nI think public art contributes to private thought, and private thought influences public policy, Vida said. That means connecting the dots to persistent inequities in housing, health care, education and criminal justice, she added.\\n\\nHow erasing Black people from local and national history for over 300 years led to the removal of confederate statues in Richmond, Virginia. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe museum plans to renovate the studio, rethink the exhibit and reopen it sometime in 2022. It's raising money along the way. And the work will go forward whether the Valentine obtains the ruined Davis statue.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe city is still taking applications from interested parties all over the country who want to house Davis or any of the 10 or so Confederate monuments that were removed over the summer.\\n\\nIn the meantime, there's still plenty of Edward Valentine art out in the world. One of the most famous is the recumbent statue of Lee near the Confederate general's tomb at Washington and Lee University in Lexington — which is embroiled in a debate about whether to change the institution's name.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNot all his works are politically charged. Valentine created the statue of naturalist John James Audubon that stands in New Orleans and a deeply spooky representation of Grief atop a grave in Richmond's Hollywood Cemetery.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut his reputation is forever linked to the figures of Confederate leaders that galvanized the summer's Black Lives Matter protests — some of which played out on the streets around the museum.\\n\\nOne night during the first weekend in June, Martin hunkered down alone inside the Valentine as police moved aggressively against protesters outside. He heard voices near a window, peeked out and saw about a dozen young demonstrators crouched in the darkness on the museum's grounds, hiding from police.\\n\\nMartin beckoned them inside, where they treated one another with milk washes for eyes stung by chemical agents. Eventually, Martin ventured out and spoke with a police officer, who told him vans were leaving with scores of protesters in custody. Once the coast was clear, the demonstrators who were holed up in the Valentine ran away safely.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe next morning, Martin and other museum staffers picked up rubber bullets, spray paint cans and protest signs from the streets outside. They added them to their collection of Richmond history, along with Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson's death mask and Lee's boots."}
{"original": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said previously that the breaches were clearly Russian in origin, and U.S. officials have for weeks said privately that Moscow's foreign intelligence service carried them out.\\n\\nThe breaches were so alarming that they had government and private-sector personnel working through the holidays to identify and mitigate them, the task force said, describing them as ongoing cyber compromises. That sense of urgency stands in contrast to Trump's effort last month to play down the significance of the breaches, saying that everything is well under control.\\n\\nIt's unfortunate that it has taken over three weeks after the revelation of an intrusion this significant for this administration to finally issue a tentative attribution, said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. We need to make clear to Russia that any misuse of compromised networks to produce destructive or harmful effects is unacceptable and will prompt an appropriately strong response.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRussia has denied any involvement.\\n\\nThe statement also said that so far investigators have identified fewer than 10 federal entities that had their networks breached, though that list includes major agencies such as the Departments of State, Treasury, Homeland Security, Energy and Commerce. And as the investigation continues, more federal agencies may turn out to have been compromised.\\n\\nPeople familiar with the matter, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, have told The Washington Post that they think as many as 250 government and private-sector entities have been compromised, though investigators are working to ascertain the exact scope of the hacks and to notify nongovernment entities affected.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShortly after the intrusions were discovered last month, the National Security Council stood up a task force, the Cyber Unified Coordination Group, to coordinate the investigation and remediation of the incident.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe task force is made up of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, with support from the National Security Agency.\\n\\nWe believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence-gathering effort, the task force said. That's an indication that officials have not found evidence of an intent to disrupt or destroy networks, or to use hacked material for an influence operation aimed at sowing discord in the United States, as Russia did in 2016.\\n\\nRather, the statement indicated, the operation was more in line with traditional espionage, stealing material that might be useful to the Kremlin. That might include information on U.S. policy decisions, potential sanctions, or how the government or industry protects its networks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate, the statement said.\\n\\nIt is unclear whether the Trump administration will do more than publicly call out Moscow for the hacks. In past cases involving cyberespionage, the United States has refrained from doing so on the grounds that the offending spy agency was doing what all nations with such capabilities, including the United States, do: spy on one another's networks.\\n\\nBut that doesn't mean the government can't take action. The United States and Russia have both expelled spies or diplomats in response to espionage operations.\\n\\nWe need to be able to respond to these incidents so they don't go unchallenged, said Christopher Painter, the top cyber-diplomat in the Obama administration. When we don't do that, we just invite further action. We don't want to be escalatory, so we want to figure out what the right action is.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.), who co-chairs the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, said the cyber-intrusions, as disturbing as they are, are not an act of war.\\n\\nI want a throat to choke on this thing — I'm angry that they got us, he told The Post. But any potential punishment should be carried out as we would for other physical espionage operations."}
{"original": "The Israeli people have the right to live in peace and security. So do the Palestinian people, Sanders tweeted. I remain concerned about the platform AIPAC provides for leaders who express bigotry and oppose basic Palestinian rights. For that reason I will not attend their conference.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis announcement cranked up to a boil a simmering left-right divide among American Jews over his candidacy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe split spans questions of whether and how to support Israel and what qualifies as anti-Semitism, those who study the community say. It includes a debate over whether Jewish ideals of justice are most urgently expressed through issues like universal health care, wage gaps and the environment, or by supporting and defending the Jewish state.\\n\\nSanders is, for some Jews, the encapsulation of what they see as Jewishness. And to some he's the antithesis, said Yehuda Kurtzer, who studies Jewish identity as president of the Shalom Hartman Institute of North America.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAmong involved Jews, I think he created a bigger problem for himself than he needed to, Kurtzer said of Sanders's decision to skip the annual Washington gathering of nearly 20,000 people. He's catering to a small percentage of his Jewish base that wants him to declare war on AIPAC.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAIPAC called Sanders's tweet truly shameful and said its conference — which focuses on preserving U.S. support for Israel's security — is mainstream, bipartisan.\\n\\nSuch debates are most important to affiliated Jews — the community center directors, synagogue presidents and rabbis from across the country who regularly attend the conference.\\n\\nBut American Jews are changing. And AIPAC's bipartisan status is as well, with the lobbying group's strong defense of Israeli security policies and embrace of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu increasingly drawing criticism from Palestinian advocates and liberal Democrats.\\n\\nA May Pew Research poll showed 42 percent of Jews believed the Trump administration favors Israel too much compared with the Palestinians. Forty-seven percent said the balance was about right. In 2013, a major Pew poll of U.S. Jews found 43 percent said caring about Israel is an essential part of being Jewish. But 38 percent of Jews under 30 said they were not very or not at all attached to Israel, compared with 23 percent of Jews over 50.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJews who do focus on Israel had strong reactions to Sanders's move on AIPAC.\\n\\nMairav Zonszein, a writer who splits her time between Israel and the United States, tweeted that Sanders is literally a hero for saying f--- you to AIPAC. The post was liked 8,100 times as of Tuesday night.\\n\\nWhen he first started to rise in the polls, I thought — he should be the Jewish community's favorite. You'd think: Finally someone who has all these social justice values, Zonszein said. But he represents the battle over what Jewish American values are on Israel. He represents this civil war.\\n\\nJonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League tweeted that Sanders's announcement was offensive, especially given a national spike in anti-Semitism.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt a time when we see a surge of real hate across the US, it's irresponsible to describe AIPAC like this. @ADL proudly will be there, his tweet said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSanders was asked in Tuesday night's debate what he would say to Jews concerned by his choice. I am very proud of being Jewish, he answered, before calling Netanyahu a reactionary racist.\\n\\nI happen to believe that what our foreign policy in the Mideast should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of Israel. But you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people.\\n\\nSanders has also taken heat from some Jewish leaders for his welcoming of support from freshman Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), strong critics of Israel who support a controversial boycott movement. Sanders does not support the boycott effort.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMultiple Jewish groups reacted to Sanders's AIPAC decision by emphasizing unity and dialogue.\\n\\nIf Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to lead the Democratic Party and the nation, I hope he can speak to, engage with, and even debate everyone, tweeted Rabbi Rick Jacobs, head of the Reform Movement, the largest denomination of Judaism in the United States.\\n\\nBut U.S. Jews are less affiliated with denominations and institutions than other faith groups. One third say they are not part of any Jewish denomination, Pew found in 2013. They may not particularly care whether Sanders, a frequent critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians, speaks at AIPAC.\\n\\nThe organization in previous decades was seen as less partisan. But its strong support for Netanyahu during the Obama administration, even as the two leaders clashed over settlements and the Iran nuclear deal, thrilled Republicans and offended many Democrats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 2016, some conference attendees gave a raucous welcome to then-candidate Donald Trump, who slammed both President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in his remarks. Hundreds had walked out in protest when Trump took the podium.\\n\\nSanders, who was also a candidate that year, declined to attend the conference but sent a video. AIPAC had allowed candidates in the past to address the conference that way. But the group said it had changed its policy and declined to play Sanders's message.\\n\\nLiberal groups critical of Israel have pressured Democratic candidates to skip this year's conference. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) told a questioner before the New Hampshire primary that she is not going; Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg say they have scheduling conflicts. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who also is Jewish, will speak at the conference. It was not clear Wednesday whether former vice president Joe Biden will attend.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSanders has been reluctant to discuss his personal life on the campaign trail, though he has opened up recently about his Jewish heritage. He ties the deaths of relatives in Nazi Europe to his fight for immigrants and his stance against white nationalism since President Trump took office.\\n\\nHis campaign did not return an email request to discuss the AIPAC decision. But he has styled himself as an insurgent, calling for radical change. So upsetting some Jewish leaders and institutions may not be a major concern to him.\\n\\nNor do Jews appear to be a key part of Sanders's base. The most recent data, from Pew in January, had just 11 percent of U.S. Jews picking Sanders as their top choice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJeremy Burton, head of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, said he's heard responses to Sanders's decision that are all over the map.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe one common theme, he said, is anxiety among Jews about having a Jewish nominee or president. That's true whether the person is Sanders or Bloomberg.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Jews know anti-Semitism is part of the DNA of Western civilization, Burton said. And when people are despairing or feeling at a loss, somehow Jews will get blamed.\\n\\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated the findings of a May Pew Research poll on the percentage of Jews under 30 who said they were not very or not at all attached to Israel. The story has been corrected."}
{"original": "When President-elect Joe Biden takes office in two weeks, he will likely enjoy unified government resting on razor-thin margins. That will probably include a 50/50 Senate with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris providing a tie-breaking vote. Straightaway, that means anything like a Green New Deal is off the table. Such sweeping climate legislation, or even enacting something like a carbon tax, would require a filibuster-proof majority or abolishing the filibuster. This isn't the Senate to deliver that.\\n\\nIn part, that's because the Democratic Party is itself split over energy and climate policy. The vocal progressive wing, personified in members such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, favors not just big spending on green initiatives, but also far-reaching mandates against fossil fuels and supporting environmental and social justice measures. On the other side stand members favoring a more cautious approach, not least because they hail from states where fossil-fuel production and distribution is a big source of economic activity, jobs and donor dollars. These include both senators from New Mexico, as well as senators in important swing states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. But one Democratic senator personifies this wing above all others: Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a sense, Manchin is the third big Senate winner this week. Assuming Ossoff prevails, Manchin is the presumptive next head of the chamber's Energy and Natural Resources Committee. His own vote is enough to swing power to a unified Republican caucus if he wants. As a Democrat in an overwhelmingly red state — and one who literally shot a copy of a carbon cap-and-trade bill in an ad for his first Senate campaign — he isn't going to be onboard for anything like a Green New Deal. He has pointedly said he doesn't back abolishing the filibuster. At the same time, however, unless he plans on simply switching parties or giving up his committee chair, he can't simply step into Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's shoes and block everything Biden and the more progressive elements of the party want to do.\\n\\nThe likely compromise involves a familiar emollient: spending. Manchin isn't inclined, both ideologically and as a matter of political survival in his coal-fired state, to back legislation that directly attacks fossil fuels, such as rescinding tax breaks for the industry or, at a more extreme level, mandating curbs on fossil-fuel production or consumption. But backing more stimulus dollars for clean technology such as electric vehicles or renewable energy is a different prospect. While West Virginians would bridle at a carbon tax, they aren't likely to be as exercised about vehicle chargers being built on their roads, especially if that brings jobs with it. And Manchin's critical role means he should be able to secure more federal dollars for the sort of climate initiatives he has favored as ranking member on the energy committee, which potentially extend the lifespan of fossil-fuel consumption, such as carbon capture, use and sequestration.\\n\\nThe upshot is that, as Biden seeks to deliver his green agenda, the emphasis is less likely to be on mandates and more on money — in the form of an expanded, green-tinted stimulus bill — at least in the short term. This fits with Biden's emphasis on job-creation as a way to sell climate action to the American public in the context of recovery from the pandemic. It also fits with his appointments at the Department of Energy and other agencies, which portend a focus on executive action to coordinate industrial policy to boost green technologies and reverse outgoing President Donald Trump's own executive actions to support fossil fuels.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd there's the wildcard himself: Trump, or rather, the Trump faction in the GOP.\\n\\nBiden has been at pains to stress bipartisanship and ignore the growing chorus of wing-nuttery from the hard right challenging his election victory. But Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based research firm, detects signs of this cracking. In his pre-runoff speech on Monday in Georgia, Biden criticized Trump's efforts to assert, take or seize power over the will of the electorate and also the incumbent Republican senators in the state for backing him up. Book also highlights Biden's use of the phrase national emergency when introducing his climate team last month, headed by Gina McCarthy. While that may have been just a throwaway line from a politician known for his syntactical throwing arm, it may also signal a willingness to resort to emergency powers to address climate change if he believes there is simply no deal to be had with Republicans. After all, Trump considered using such powers to force utilities to buy electricity from his favorite nuclear and coal-fired plants in the name of national security.\\n\\nOn that score, the constitutional arson likely to be attempted by a depressingly significant number of Republican pyromaniacs in Congress on Wednesday (and maybe into Thursday, given the debate rules) could provide the spark. Apart from Biden, perhaps Manchin's own centrism could be tested by such naked efforts to overturn America's democratic institutions and norms. As I have written before, the Republican shield for the fossil-fuels business has been effective; but as the party veers ever further away from conservatism toward radicalism, it becomes a liability. Georgia's unlikely result probably portends a relatively moderate green policy centered on stimulus spending. The Republican reaction could change that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\\n\\nLiam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering energy, mining and commodities.

{"original": "The comments from Sens. Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Susan Collins (Maine) — the only Senate Republicans running for reelection in states Trump lost — pointed to cracks within the GOP that could grow as the shutdown nears the two-week mark. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) reiterated Thursday that the Senate will take up only spending legislation that Trump supports.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcConnell's stance prompted angry attacks Thursday from new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other Democrats, who insisted they were trying to give Republicans a way out of the standoff by passing two pieces of legislation: one a package of six spending bills that were negotiated on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and would reopen nearly all the federal agencies that have been shuttered since Dec. 22, and the second a stopgap spending bill through Feb. 8 covering only the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nThe six-bill package passed the House 241-190 on Thursday night, and the short-term Homeland Security spending bill passed 239-192. A handful of Republicans broke ranks on each measure to vote yes with the Democrats.\\n\\nThe House strategy could allow Senate Republicans to pass legislation that would reopen most of the government while setting aside the debate over the border wall. But thus far, because of Trump's opposition, party leaders have refused.\\n\\nPeople are streaming into national parks to find trash cans overflowing and restrooms locked. Volunteers are stepping in to stop conditions from deteriorating. (Luis Velarde, Juca Favela/The Washington Post)\\n\\nWhat we're asking the Republicans in the Senate to do is to take 'yes' for an answer. We are sending them back exactly, word for word, what they have passed, Pelosi said. Why would they not do that? Is it because the president won't sign it? Did they not hear about the coequal branch of government, and that we the Congress send the president legislation and he can choose to sign or not?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcConnell on Thursday restated the stance he has adopted since the Senate unanimously passed a short-term spending bill last month without additional wall funding — only to watch as Trump turned against it the very next morning amid a conservative backlash.\\n\\nI've made it clear on several occasions, and let me say it again: The Senate will not take up any proposal that does not have a real chance of passing this chamber and getting a presidential signature. Let's not waste the time, McConnell said. Let's not get off on the wrong foot, with House Democrats using their new platform to produce political statements rather than serious solutions.\\n\\nAs the impasse dragged on, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said for the first time that the stalemate could continue for months and months. A funding lapse of that length would have compounding consequences for the government's ability to provide promised services, and for the approximately 800,000 federal workers who are either furloughed at home or working without any guarantee of getting paid.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLink copied link This shutdown is officially the longest ever. Here's how others ended. The funding gap shuttered parts of several key Cabinet departments. AD AD\\n\\nComments from the most politically vulnerable members of McConnell's caucus suggested discomfort with the majority leader's approach, and a desire for a quick resolution to the shutdown.\\n\\nI think we should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today, Gardner said, as the 116th Congress got underway with pomp and ceremony on both sides of the Capitol.\\n\\nEven if the legislation doesn't have the border money Trump wants, Gardner said, We can pass legislation that has the appropriations number in it while we continue to get more but we should continue to do our jobs and get the government open and let Democrats explain why they no longer support border security.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCollins, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, also indicated support for an element of the Democrats' approach.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm not saying their whole plan is a valid plan, but I see no reason why the bills that are ready to go and on which we've achieved an agreement should be held hostage to this debate over border security, she said.\\n\\nNevertheless, Trump showed no sign Thursday that he was going to budge.\\n\\nA veto threat issued by the White House against the House bills read: The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen lapsed agencies, but cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation's urgent border security needs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump himself made an appearance in the White House briefing room, where, flanked by members of the union for Border Patrol agents, he said he has never had so much support as I have in the last week over my stance on border security . . . and for, frankly, the wall, or the barrier.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWithout a wall you cannot have border security, Trump continued. It won't work.\\n\\nTop congressional leaders plan to meet with Trump at the White House on Friday, in a repeat of a meeting they had on Wednesday. But so far there are no signs of a breakthrough or any movement.\\n\\nWe're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall? Pelosi said Thursday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVice President Pence, in an interview Thursday on Fox News, reinforced the administration's position. I think the president has made it very clear: no wall, no deal, Pence said.\\n\\nThe shutdown has lasted 13 days without any signs of compromise or earnest negotiations, with Democrats largely unifying and a number of Republicans flummoxed over Trump's strategy.\\n\\nMany of the federal workers affected will miss their first paycheck beginning next week. Multiple national parks and museums have closed, and the impact is expected to become even more severe in the coming weeks. The food stamp program that millions of Americans rely on may grind to a halt beginning in February, and the Internal Revenue Service will not be able to process refunds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nComplicating matters for the White House, McConnell has distanced himself from the discussions since Trump turned on the spending bill passed by the Senate last month, which enraged some Republicans who had voted for the measure believing that they had Trump's backing.\\n\\nShelby's comments marked the first time a top political figure estimated the shutdown could drag into the spring, drawing alarm from federal workers and others.\\n\\nHearing this from the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee is, quite candidly, a punch in the jaw of federal employees, said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000 federal employees. Their mental anguish and anxiety is bad enough. To hear this coming straight from congressional leaders does not instill a lot of hope.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to erect a wall along the Mexico border and have Mexico pay for it. He said terrorists, drugs and criminals were coming to the United States through Mexico and needed to be stopped. This pledge proved very popular with many of his supporters.\\n\\nSince taking over in 2017, Trump has continued to assert that a wall is needed but has backed away from insisting that Mexico pay for it. He has instead said the money should come from U.S. taxpayers, an idea that has divided Republicans. But many Republicans, some reluctantly, have agreed to follow his lead during the current shutdown.\\n\\nThough some Senate Republicans broke with Trump and leadership Thursday, others cautioned about what would happen if he caved on his signature promise.\\n\\nIf he gives in now, that's the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) on Wednesday during an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News. That's probably the end of his presidency. Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people: He's going to secure our border.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe shutdown is affecting about a quarter of the portion of the federal government funded by Congress, since the Pentagon and major agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services have already been funded through Sept. 30 by spending bills passed by Congress earlier in the year. Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security also are not affected."}

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — and that is preventing working-class families from getting ahead.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) officially launched her 2020 presidential campaign Feb. 9, more than a month after announcing her exploratory committee. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\\n\\nImplicit in that was criticism of both Trump and, more broadly, of politics as practiced in Washington.\\n\\nThe heart of it is this question of corruption, Warren told a crowd in Sioux City on Saturday morning. Every issue that affects us in this country right now . . . they intersect with this fundamental question of who government works for.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe senator from Massachusetts made nearly identical pitches on her five-town, three-day tour of the western side of the state, projecting energy and eagerness to engage with voters even as she was hobbled by a cold that made her voice raspy. She spoke to crowds that totaled about 2,700 people during the trip — addressing each for about an hour.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBefore she entered politics, Warren was an academic studying consumer bankruptcy, and much of her focus in office has followed that vein. But as she outlined her agenda in Iowa, Warren expanded beyond that: She proposed an anti-corruption bill that would ban lawmakers from becoming lobbyists, advocated stronger unions and touted a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to vote.\\n\\nWe need to attack, head on, the costs that are crushing ­middle-class families, she said, listing health care, housing, child care and education. Those are investments we need to make as a country, Warren said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMissing from Warren's overarching presentation were the micro issues that are of particular interest to Iowa. She said little about agriculture and gave a vague answer when asked about the recently passed farm bill.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt has some good provisions, said Warren, who voted for the bill. She added: It's got a lot of compromises in it. And I think we need a farm bill that works better for smaller farms. That's the part that interests me the most.\\n\\nWarren also took pains to broaden what Democrats and other voters may know of her biography, beyond her representation of a strongly liberal state. When asked how she would appeal to conservatives, the former Harvard law professor harked back to her youth in Oklahoma and her family members who are still there.\\n\\nI have three older brothers, Warren told a crowd at a panel for women's right activists in Ankeny on Sunday. And one of my three brothers is a Democrat. I love all three of my brothers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe brothers, she said, can all agree that government should reflect our values.\\n\\nShe linked her hardscrabble upbringing to her interest in seeking the White House. Her mother, she said, was able to save their family from poverty with a minimum-wage job.\\n\\nBack when I was in middle school . . . a minimum-wage job in America would support a family of three, Warren said. Today a minimum-wage job in America will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty.\\n\\nHer message appeared to penetrate.\\n\\nI think she has the middle class in mind, said Alison Anker, 27, after seeing Warren in Des Moines on Saturday. She wants everyone to have an opportunity.\\n\\nDuring the trip, which crossed through the rolling, brown Iowa fields, Warren seemed to enjoy the enthusiastic crowds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Des Moines, when an audience member shouted Do you like to dance? Warren raised her hands in the air, and did a little kick to show her moves.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen her microphone stopped working at her first event in Council Bluffs on Friday night, she soldiered on, straining her voice. In Des Moines, she joked about it using a criticism of her by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that has become a call to arms for Warren and other femalepoliticians.\\n\\nThe bad news is I've caught a cold, Warren said. The good news is, nevertheless, I persist.\\n\\nAt times she showed off a droll wit: How do you debate someone who isn't interested in civility or in facts? one audience member asked at the Des Moines event.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren deadpanned: Did you have somebody specific in mind?\\n\\nWarren avoided not only mentions of Trump but also other potential Democratic candidates, by name at least.\\n\\nBut she did repeat her call that Democrats running for president refrain from self-funding, an obvious reference to possible candidates such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg or environmental activist Tom Steyer. Both have spent tens of millions in recent elections and have more to use on their own behalf.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren took questions from audience members at every event, using an unusual raffle system to determine who would get a question. In total, she took 31 audience queries, a number her highly organized campaign staff carefully tracked. She also took questions from reporters after four of her five events.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren endured a rocky few months before making her candidacy official last week, some of it caused by her October release of a DNA test meant to prove a distant relative was Native American. The claim had drawn criticism from President Trump and other Republicans; after the results were released they continued to criticize her, and she also came under fire from some Democrats upset that she's defined ethnicity with a test.\\n\\nBut that came up only briefly during a trip that rewarded Warren with robust crowds and expressions of support, a year before Iowans have to choose a favorite.\\n\\nAfter deplaning at the Omaha airport, she was recognized by several people, some of whom wished her good luck as she stood in a lengthy line for the bathroom.\\n\\nAnd after three days in Iowa, as Warren and her aides walked briskly through a sports bar to head for a flight from Des Moines to Boston, people began to cheer."}
{"original": "Polyannas will try to deny this, but look at the facts: Most major European economies are stagnant and reeling from the pandemic. Their governments were debt-ridden before the pandemic and have borrowed tens of billions of dollars since to keep afloat. China has the cash to splash on strategic investments that will employ millions of Europeans and perhaps even to purchase government bonds and directly finance government deficits. A debt-ridden United States is not in the economic position to displace Chinese influence-buying.\\n\\nChina's behavior also shows that they will use this influence to displace America's. It has economically threatened Australia for that country's tough stance toward Chinese power grabs. It has bullied U.S. companies when employees exercise free speech to criticize Chinese government acts, forcing them to bow to Beijing even when doing so violates democratic norms. It's inconceivable that Beijing will suddenly reverse course and not use its economic leverage in Europe to advance its geopolitical aims.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEuropean leaders claim that the agreement will nudge China toward compliance with the rule of law and global democratic norms, but that's a pipe dream. Hong Kong is a perfect example of that. China has flagrantly violated its promises to maintain Hong Kong's separate status, including the arrest of at least 53 democracy activists and local legislators Tuesday for alleged subversion. China also continues to suppress local Tibetan and Xinjiang populations, sending residents to what appear to be forced labor camps. The communist government has been clear that it regards global condemnation of its activities as unwarranted interference in its domestic affairs. Promises in the deal to adhere to some global practices will prove less worthy than the paper they are printed on.\\n\\nThe Biden's administration will likely try to push back against this, and E.U. governments will accommodate U.S. requests to some degree. E.U. countries still feel threatened by Russia, and they remain dependent on the U.S. military to deter Russian aggression. But make no mistake: E.U. leaders have been saying for years that they want to be neutral in the U.S.-China conflict. Unless the German or French governments decide to change those aspirations, Europe will try to chart a course between the two global superpowers, tacking to and fro to keep on both nations' good side. This will give the United States some instances where it can claim to have blunted China's rise, but the underlying economic fact of growing interdependence will ultimately prove more important.\\n\\nThe United States is not powerless to prevent this, but it will likely need to act more forcefully than Biden wants to keep the E.U. firmly tied to America. Biden would have to force nations such as Germany to choose between maintaining the security and economic ties it has with the United States and improving its cooperation with China. That approach is something Europeans want to avoid, and President Trump's attempts to use the American stick to keep the alliance in line have angered advocates of the transatlantic alliance on both sides of the ocean. But at some point, it will become impossible to square this strategic circle; either the United States or China will use its influence to force the Europeans to choose which side they are on. The longer the United States waits to force that choice, the harder it will be to push China back.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe post-World War II era was founded on U.S. economic dominance. That dominance is fading fast as globalization transfers resources, knowledge and power to countries outside the traditional U.S. alliance structure. America's economic and foreign policy elites remain in denial about this fundamental fact and persist in the belief that the United States can continue to exert global dominance without the economic or military dominance it has enjoyed for decades. Without significant changes, such as dramatically increasing the size of the U.S. military and finding new allies to supplement or replace wavering old ones, the Biden administration will more likely preside over America's decline than its resurgence.\\n\\nSign up to receive my columns in your inbox as soon as they're published."}
{"original": "On Wednesday, in a dramatic exchange at the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, he confronted Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, whom he believed was ultimately responsible for twice barring him from casting ballots.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut after video of the encounter circulated online, Cleveland.com and Husted's surrogates noted that Husted had nothing to do with Helle's removal. The process for canceling his registration was actually set in motion when Husted's predecessor, Democrat Jennifer Brunner, was secretary of state.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI've made it my mission as Secretary of State to make Ohio a place where it is both easy to vote and hard to cheat and by any objective measure we have achieved this goal, Husted said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post.\\n\\nIt is now easier for Ohioans serving in the military to vote than at any time in our state's history, he added, pointing to the state's early voting program, online registration and military ready-to-vote program as examples.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHelle said his message remained the same.\\n\\nWe shouldn't be purging service members or veterans, or any Ohioans for that matter, he told The Post on Friday.\\n\\nFor Helle, the moment was more than six years in the making. In 2011, he returned from tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and tried to vote in a local election, only to be told that poll workers couldn't find his name. A couple of months later, in the general election, he was blocked again. This time, board of elections officials revealed he had been removed from the state's roll due to inactivity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI started crying, Helle told The Post. To come home after defending that fundamental right and to be told that I couldn't exercise it, that was heartbreaking.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOhio's voter registration rules are some of the country's most punitive. Voters who fail to cast ballots for two years receive a notice in the mail. If they don't respond, change their registration or vote in the following four years, they are purged from the rolls.\\n\\nSince 2011, the practice has been overseen by Husted, who, like other supporters of such measures, says it is necessary to curb fraud and ensure the integrity of the state electoral system. The Democratic secretary of state before him used the practice as well.\\n\\nBut a group of Ohioans like Helle allege they were wrongfully disenfranchised under the use-it-or-lose-it policy, as it's casually known. Purporting to represent thousands of other similarly situated Ohioans, they sued Husted in federal court, arguing the policy violates the U.S. Constitution and voting rights law. They were joined by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and a homeless advocacy group.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Wednesday morning, after the lawsuit climbed through the lower courts over 18 months, the Supreme Court held closely watched oral arguments in the case.\\n\\nThe justices peppered the attorneys for the parties with questions about whether the policy was a reasonable and legally sound way for the state to prune its voter lists. But the real fireworks happened outside.\\n\\nWhen Husted emerged from the building, Helle was waiting for him, flanked by supporters and camera crews.\\n\\nWe believe our state is one where we make it easy to vote and hard to cheat, Husted told Helle, according to NPR. We make every effort possible to reach out to voters to get them registered to vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHelle, who is not a plaintiff in the litigation, pushed back.\\n\\nI never received any such notice, he told Husted, because I was an active-duty soldier that maintained my home of record in the state of Ohio, came back home after defending that right, and could not exercise it because of this archaic, terrible policy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVideo of the exchange captured by Cleveland.com showed the two standing just a few feet apart as a group of onlookers watched. Husted pursed his lips as he listened to Helle talk. Helle, he said, didn't seem to grasp the policy.\\n\\nAll you have to do is use your right to vote, Husted said.\\n\\nFrom a mountainside, sir? responded Helle, a former airborne infantry sergeant.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHusted told him the registration process took only minutes.\\n\\nWhat about soldiers serving overseas anywhere in the world, riding around in a Humvee, conducting missions 20 hours a day? Helle asked. What I know is that I was wrongfully purged.\\n\\nYou weren't wrongfully purged, Husted said. He then walked off, with Helle and several people behind him chanting shame.\\n\\nAs political theater, it seemed to work well for the 31-year-old veteran-turned-politician, who recently announced that he was running for the Ohio House of Representatives, hoping to unseat a Republican incumbent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHusted is running for Ohio lieutenant governor on a ticket with Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is running for governor\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBrunner, Husted's predecessor, in 2007 and again in 2009 ordered county election boards to take steps that resulted in people like Helle being scrubbed, Cleveland.com reported Friday. Under her directives, the boards mailed notices to anyone who hadn't voted in two years and hand't confirmed their address. If the voters didn't reply to the mailings or vote in back-to-back elections, their names got deleted.\\n\\nHelle first registered to vote in 2004, when he was 18. After joining the Army, he was sent to Alaska, then deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom between 2006 and 2011. He told The Post he tried to vote absentee from overseas, but his ballot never made it to Ohio.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCounty officials sent Helle a confirmation letter in 2008, then removed him as a registered voter on Jan. 13, 2011 after he didn't respond, according to Cleveland.com. Husted had been in office for three days at that point. Helle learned of the move when he tried unsuccessfully to vote in two elections later that year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarol Ann Hill, director of the Ottawa County Board of Elections, said local officials, not Husted, were responsible for the decision.\\n\\nNo. All 88 counties follow the law, Hill told Cleveland.com. The secretary of state does not say 'OK, now it's time to remove these voters.'\\n\\nBy all appearances on Wednesday, Helle blamed Husted for disenfranchising him. Following their confrontation, a tweet went out from Helle's Twitter account reading: I was able to speak my truth to the man who silenced my vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut he now suggests otherwise. And the tweet, Helle said, was written by a member of his team.\\n\\nI've never publicly, to my recollection, stated Jon Husted was specifically responsible, he told The Post in an email. However, while in DC I did have someone using my Twitter for me, to which they made an honest mistake and wrote a tweet that said I faced the person who purged me. It's since been corrected.\\n\\nHelle, who was elected mayor of Oak Harbor in 2015, said his involvement with the voter purge case was a pure accident.\\n\\nWhen he learned he was removed from Ohio's rolls, nobody really cared about the issue, he told The Post. Years later, after putting the issue behind him, he stumbled across a Facebook post about the Supreme Court case and left a comment about what he went through. The left-leaning interest group Progress Ohio took notice, as did the ACLU, he said. Soon after, the calls started coming in from news organizations and advocacy groups.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis trip to Washington on Wednesday was paid for by an organization affiliated with one of the plaintiffs, he said. He woke up at 2 a.m., drove two hours to the airport in Detroit and boarded a predawn flight. By late morning, he was on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nBefore his confrontation with Husted, he gave a short speech about voting rights outside the high court. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) joined him in front of the portico, where the senator told reporters his state was engaging in wholesale eliminating names of people who have served our country or people who haven't.\\n\\nVoter fraud is rare in both Ohio and nationwide. Probes of supposed voting irregularities routinely fail to turn up evidence of widespread or even marginal instances of it. In Ohio, Husted's own review of the 2016 election referred a mere 52 cases of possible fraud for prosecution or further investigation, as Cleveland.com reported.\\n\\nHelle, who returned to Oak Harbor late Wednesday, said he was glad for the chance to look this gentleman in the eye that's driving the cart and ask him why this is worth removing servicemen and women from voter rolls.\\n\\nThe secretary of state, he said, is out of touch."}
{"original": "On behalf of myself, my family and, I am sure, a great many of my fellow members of Woodmont Country Club, I apologize to President Obama and his family for the expressions of concern about his family's membership in our club solely because of his administration's recent decision concerning the U.N. vote on Israeli settlements [Jewish country club split on accepting Obama, Metro, Jan. 14]. The expressed concerns are not held by our membership generally, the club as an entity or by a majority of Jewish Americans throughout the country. We should be proud to have Mr. Obama as a member of our club; I believe most of the club's members agree. That some members consider U.S. policy on Israel — good or bad — as the principal criterion for club membership is a sorry state of affairs, particularly because half of Israelis apparently agree that settlements in the West Bank are not in the best interests of Israel and that freedom of expression is a hallmark of both the American and Israeli democracies.\\n\\nWoodmont has never had a political litmus test for membership; rather, membership has been, and should continue to be, about the character of the prospective member and not his views about a single foreign (or domestic) policy issue.

{"original": "Every day, Border Patrol encounters roughly 2,000 illegal immigrants — we have to talk about this — trying to enter our country. Two thousand a day, and that's a minimum.\\n\\nThis is misleading. Trump is conflating two different numbers reported monthly by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFirst, there's the figure for Southwest border apprehensions. Anyone caught trying to cross the border illegally is tallied in this column. For fiscal 2018, CBP reported 396,579 apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border. So far in fiscal 2019, the number is 102,857.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's a separate figure for what CBP calls inadmissibles. It's incorrect to describe these individuals as illegal immigrants, as Trump did.\\n\\nInadmissibles refers to individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an application for admission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe, according to CBP. All of this is legal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn fiscal 2018, CBP reported 124,511 inadmissibles, and so far in fiscal 2019, the number is 20,371.\\n\\nAdding up apprehensions and inadmissibles — as the Trump administration began to do in early 2018 on CBP's website — produces a much higher total than simply reporting apprehensions. The combined total was above 60,000 in October and November each, which is roughly 2,000 a day.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut inadmissibles are not illegal immigrants.\\n\\nUsing only the number for Southwest border apprehensions in fiscal 2018, the average is roughly 1,000 a day, or half what Trump claimed.\\n\\nNow, the Democrats of the bill want $12 billion additional for foreign aid. They want $12 billion more. It's $54.4 billion, which is by itself a lot, but in foreign aid they want 12 billion over the $54 billion. Think of it. We give $54 billion, a lot of it because they want to give it. They don't even know who they're giving it to. In many cases, people don't ever — don't even know the name of the country. They know nothing about the country, and yet — so they're going to give 54.4 billion in foreign aid but they want 12 billion more than that in foreign aid but they won't approve $5.6 billion for a wall that's going to pay for itself almost on a monthly basis.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump mixes up a lot of things here. The fiscal 2018 budget for the State Department and foreign operations (including foreign aid) was $54 billion. The Trump administration proposed cutting it to $42 billion in fiscal 2019. The Senate Appropriations Committee, in a unanimous bipartisan vote, approved a budget of $54.4 billion. The Republicans control the Senate. So it was not just Democrats, it was not $12 billion over $54 billion and it was not all money for foreign aid but also money — about $12 billion — to keep the State Department running.\\n\\nAs we have noted before, the wall won't pay for itself on a monthly basis.\\n\\nYou know when a country sends us 200 soldiers to Iraq or sends us 100 soldiers from a big country to Syria or to Afghanistan and then they tell me 100 times we sent you soldiers, we sent you soldiers. And that's 1/100 of the money that they are taking advantage of. They are just doing that to make me happy or to make past presidents happy. I've heard past presidents, well, they're involved in the Afghanistan War because they sent us 100 soldiers and yet it's costing us billions and billions of dollars.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Trump's transactional view of the world, countries that he believes are doing better in one sphere (such as trade or receiving foreign aid) must pony up to settle accounts elsewhere. So, even though the United States is a large country with the most powerful military in the world, he mocks much smaller nations for contributing 100 or 200 soldiers to wars led by Americans.\\n\\nMany of those contributions are indicative of political support for U.S. goals, a diplomatic achievement that previous administrations have touted as important. The initial invasion of Iraq was largely a U.S.-British effort, but the Bush administration worked hard to persuade countries as small as Albania (1,340 troops over five years), Estonia (240 troops over six years) and Mongolia (1,128 troops over five years) to contribute to the post-invasion force.\\n\\nIn Afghanistan, NATO took the lead of the International Security Assistance Force, which at one point topped 130,000 troops. The United States contributed 90,000 of those troops, but it was still important diplomatically that countries as small as Montenegro and Luxembourg contributed to the effort. The United Kingdom had more than 450 soldiers killed in Afghanistan, including more than 400 in hostile action.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo we are killing and then I read when we pull out Russia's thrilled. Russia is not happy. You know why they're not happy? Because they like it when we're killing ISIS because we are killing them for them and we are killing them for Assad and we are killing ISIS also for Iran and just while we're on Iran because you know people don't like to write the facts.\\n\\nTrump distorts some of the basics of the Syrian civil war. There are many sides to this conflict. Russia supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime while the United States supports Kurdish opposition groups and anti-Assad forces. The Islamic State terrorist group is another faction.\\n\\nBecause Russia and the United States are on different sides, it's no surprise that Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw nearly 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. In a news conference Dec. 20, Putin gave extended remarks clearly in support of Trump's move.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIs the presence of American troops required there? I do not think it is, Putin said. However, let us not forget that their presence, the presence of your troops, is illegitimate as it was not approved by a U.N. Security Council Resolution. The military contingent can only be there under a resolution of the U.N. Security Council or at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government. Russian troops were invited by the Syrian government. The United States did not get either of these, so if they decide to withdraw their troops, it is the right decision.\\n\\nRussian officials have long contended that the presence of U.S. forces in Syria is illegal. There's simply no debate that Russia was happy with Trump's decision to withdraw. Even if both countries are fighting the Islamic State, they nonetheless have a range of competing interests in the region.\\n\\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Dec. 24 that the U.S. presence was destabilizing Syria. His spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said Dec. 26: In our opinion, this decision [by Trump] is important in that it can promote a comprehensive settlement of the situation. We have pointed out more than once that the U.S. occupation of a considerable part of Syrian territory is a major obstacle to such a settlement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI could give you an example where I get along very well with India and Prime Minister Modi but he's constantly telling me he built the library in Afghanistan. Okay, a library. That's like, you know what that is? That's like five hours of what we spend. And he tells it and he's very smart and we are supposed to say thank you for the library. I don't know who's using it in Afghanistan but one of those things.\\n\\nTrump's remarks set off a firestorm in India, where officials indignantly noted that India is the largest donor in the region and has contributed more than $3 billion in postwar reconstruction, including a 135-mile road, a dam providing irrigation to farmers and training programs for more than 3,500 Afghans in India. New Delhi has also provided 1.1 million tons of wheat to Afghanistan as well as a 400-bed children's hospital. Officials said that small libraries have been built as part of community development projects, but were puzzled why Trump focused on a single library.\\n\\nSo with all of that, with all of that being said I did something called terminate the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which by the way in eight years gives Iran the legal right to have nuclear weapons, okay? I did it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump in May withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), what's known as the Iran nuclear deal, and has been defending his decision ever since with false or misleading claims.\\n\\nWe gave the president Four Pinocchios for claiming that the international accord would have allowed Iran to build nuclear weapons in seven years. (He now says eight years, but that's just as false.)\\n\\nAlthough some parts of the JCPOA sunset over time, gradually allowing Iran to pursue more nuclear energy research, the deal includes this permanent restriction: Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.\\n\\nOther international agreements to which Iran has committed itself also prohibit the development of such weapons. Iran also has agreed to let international monitors peer closely into its nuclear activities. The Trump and Obama administrations have both certified that Iran was meeting its JCPOA commitments.\\n\\nHowever, critics of the JCPOA have voiced concerns that — despite these strictures — Iran could keep working toward nuclear weapons capability under the guise of pursuing peaceful goals, such as a nuclear energy program.\\n\\nTrump is alluding to the fact that the JCPOA gradually lifts restrictions on the types of nuclear activities and the level of uranium enrichment Iran may conduct. These and other provisions sunset over 10, 15, 20 or 25 years.\\n\\nThe president argues that easing these restrictions over time would open the door to Iran's attaining nuclear weapons capability, rendering the JCPOA ultimately ineffective. But supporters of the Iran deal dispute that and say the JCPOA at least buys time, subjecting Iran to strong constraints on its nuclear activities for 10 to 25 years. Without the JCPOA, Iran could hasten its development of nuclear weapons on an even shorter timeline than the one Trump found unacceptable, they say.\\n\\nDuring a Cabinet meeting Jan. 2, President Trump spoke about foreign involvement in Afghanistan and his decision to withdraw U.S. troops. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nRussia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan, Russia. So you take a look at other countries, Pakistan is there. They should be fighting but Russia should be fighting. The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia, they were right to be there. The problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt. They went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union.\\n\\nThere has already been a lot of commentary about Trump's mystifying remarks justifying the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. His comments appear to mirror an effort by lawmakers from Putin's party to overturn a resolution passed in the waning days of the Soviet Union, signed by Mikhail Gorbachev, that the Soviet invasion deserved moral and political condemnation.\\n\\nJust about every statement by Trump here is wrong. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up a Communist government that had seized power before it was toppled by political unrest; there were no terrorists going into Russia. (Perhaps the president is thinking of Chechnya?) The United States secretly funded Afghan insurgents who helped make the war a quagmire for the Soviets — what the State Department says became the longest and largest [covert action] in U.S. history to that point. The Afghan war might have been a contributing factor to the Soviet Union's collapse but it was certainly not the only factor. The biggest factor likely was a collapse in oil prices after Saudi Arabia altered its oil policy in 1985, which led to massive borrowing by the government and then an effective bankruptcy of the country.\\n\\nAs it happens, the State Department on Dec. 20 released an official history of U.S. policy in Afghanistan between 1977-80 that contrasts sharply with Trump's explanation:\\n\\nBy the end of 1979 the insurgency was threatening to depose the central government in Kabul, and the Kremlin had lost confidence in the recently ascended Afghan leader Hafizullah Amin. Citing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that once a country had turned communist, Moscow would resolve to keep it in the revolutionary camp, the Soviet leadership decided to execute a full political and military takeover of Afghanistan. On December 25, 1979, Soviet forces invaded the country and killed Amin in Kabul at the Presidential Palace. Two days later President Carter approved a new covert action to send lethal aid to the Afghan Mujahidin insurgents, rebuked the invasion in a strongly worded letter to Brezhnev, and undertook an array of diplomatic and economic sanctions in consultation with U.S. allies to protest Soviet policy.\\n\\nIndia, Russia, you look at some of the satellite countries that are extremely wealthy with oil surrounding. I spoke to some of this. I said to them a certain country, very rich country, what would you do if the United States pulled out? 'Oh, we'd be taken over by the Taliban and terrorists.' I said then why are you charging us when we have to use your country to send product through? Why are you charging us when we send airplanes over your country? We are doing the job for you. Why are you charging us? He said to me, very great gentleman, smart, he said to me: 'Well, nobody ever asked me not to.' I said, 'I'm asking you not to.' He said we will not charge you, and I am talking about millions and millions of dollars. Flights over his country. But I say to him what would happen if we weren't here and he looks at me and he goes, 'We would be overrun, we could not defend ourselves,' and yet he charges us, but he doesn't charge us anymore.\\n\\nThis remains a mystery. Trump has a habit of suggesting he's able to pull off a quick deal with foreign leaders because no one previously had made the right demands. So we take this tale with a large grain of salt; the White House did not respond to a query.\\n\\nAfter considering various options, we believe he may be talking about a conversation with Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan. Trump has met twice with Nazarbayev, including once at the White House. The Kazakhstan government in 2018 approved an agreement to allow the United States to use two of its ports for shipping nonmilitary material to Afghanistan and has allowed overflights since 2010. But the text of the agreement (see Article 18) says that U.S. military transport aircraft would not be subject to payment of air navigation fees, only nonmilitary aircraft. There could be reasonable airport fees assessed if any planes landed at airports.\\n\\nSo Trump says the United States was charged millions and millions of dollars for flights over his country and claims the other leader says he won't charge the country. But in the case of Kazakhstan, the agreement already says the United States will not be charged.\\n\\nBut maybe Trump did not know that and Nazarbayev just restated the existing agreement? Trump has previously claimed he got China's president to reopen its market to American beef even though the deal had already been reached during the Obama administration.\\n\\nAnother problem: Trump says the country's leader said the Taliban would overrun them without U.S. protection, but that's simply not the case with Kazakhstan.\\n\\nWe considered Turkmenistan, whose fees for allowing overflights was disclosed through WikiLeaks, but can find no evidence that Trump has spoken to its leader, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov. The White House now rarely discloses when the president speaks with a foreign leader but presumably Turkmenistan would have touted such an interaction. Turkmenistan, having a border with Afghanistan, would potentially face more of threat from the Taliban, but that's still a stretch.\\n\\nSo there's no evidence to back up Trump's story. Given his track record, we are pretty sure elements of it are false or exaggerated.\\n\\nI was here on Christmas evening, I was all by myself in the White House. That's a big, big house except for all of the guys out on the lawn with machine guns.\\n\\nTrump was not alone in the White House on Christmas Eve, or on Christmas. First lady Melania Trump cut short a trip to Florida to join the president in Washington from Christmas Eve onward.\\n\\nPeople see that gasoline is way down and the reason it's way down is because I called up some of the OPEC people. I say, 'Don't do it.' You know, if you look back a few months, gasoline was at $83 a barrel, that was going to be bad and it was going to $100 and some people were saying $125, Rick. And I made calls. I say, 'You'd better let that oil — that gasoline flow,' and they did and now it's down to $44, and I put out a social media statement yesterday. I said, 'Do you think it's luck that that happened?' It's not luck. It's not luck. I called up certain people and I said, 'Let that damn oil and gasoline, you let it flow, the oil!' It was going up to $125. If that would have happened then you would have had a recession, depression like we've had in the past when that happened.\\n\\nThe president has little power to move prices at the gas pump in any direction because they depend on market forces beyond his control. A variety of market factors has contributed to the falling price of gasoline. None of them involves Trump's phone calls to foreign leaders in oil-rich countries.\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\\n\\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles\\n\\nShare the Facts 2019-01-04 12:13:11 UTC Washington Post -1 -1 -1 Washington Post Rating: Highly Unlikely Washington Post Rating: He said we will not charge you, and I am talking about millions and millions of dollars.

{"original": "The Smithsonian Institution declined to comment on the circumstances of Helgen's departure, citing a policy against commenting on personnel matters. [Update on July 4, 2017 to this story, originally published on Jan. 13, 2017: Helgen, now at the University of Adelaide, shared a letter from Smithsonian Institution Acting Provost Richard Kurin saying that Helgen had been cleared of any wrongdoing.]\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen he handed in his resignation Thursday, Helgen said that his department chair, Jonathan Coddington, told him, Now give me your underwear — a remark that Helgen said did not seem like a joke.\\n\\nTo me it was just an unbelievable moment of indignity after 15 months of anguish over complaints that were just really hard to understand in the first place, Helgen said.\\n\\nCoddington did not respond to a request for comment on the allegation.\\n\\nHelgen became curator of the mammals collection at the museum when he was just 28 and is considered a rising star in the world of zoology. In 2013, he was the lead researcher on the celebrated discovery of a new raccoon species called olinguito — the first carnivorous mammal to be discovered in the Americas in a generation. He also drew coverage for his 2015 expedition to Kenya, which was modeled on a similar trip taken by Theodore Roosevelt for the museum more than a century ago. Just this week, he was part of a team that announced the discovery of a new primate species they call the Skywalker hoolock gibbon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAccording to Helgen and some of his colleagues, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared losing their jobs, the media attention, paired with Helgen's unorthodox way of doing things, meant Helgen ran afoul of museum administrators and some other colleagues. Many at the institution seem to have been rankled by behavior they saw as brash or unscientific, such as reorganizing the mammal division, bringing in many more students and interns, and pushing to get more news coverage, they said.\\n\\nThe investigation into Helgen's trip was first reported by writer Michael Balter in the Verge in August. Staffers had alleged that, during the 2015 trip to Kenya, Helgen attempted to take specimens out of the country without a proper permit. An initial inquiry by the Smithsonian's inspector general found evidence of confusion about the handling of specimens but concluded that no laws or Smithsonian rules had been broken. Then the museum opened its own investigation, which went on for 10 months. Based on interviews with Helgen's co-leaders on the Kenya trip, the Verge alleged that the inquiry ignored evidence that could have exonerated Helgen.\\n\\nIt was a witch hunt, one researcher, speaking anonymously out of concern for his job, told The Washington Post. How else do you characterize going after someone who was cleared of criminal charges? The only thing that comes to mind is a witch hunt out of jealousy . . . It looks like the whole arc was 'I'm going to teach you a lesson.'\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the end, Kirk Johnson, director of the National Museum of Natural History, found Helgen partially responsible for some of the accusations and ruled that he be suspended without pay for two weeks. When Helgen returned, he wasn't allowed back into his office and had to get permission from a collections manager to access the collection for which he was curator.\\n\\nIt really is the way I was treated on my return that made me think it was going to be a better idea to move on to a position elsewhere, Helgen said. Even when I thought this was behind me, I was isolated in the section of the museum away from my duties and collection.\\n\\nDuring the investigation, many top scientists, including writer Jared Diamond, Australian mammalogist Tim Flannery, and Harvard evolutionary biologist and National Museum of Natural History board member Scott Edwards, sent letters in support of Helgen to museum officials. Nearly three dozen of Helgen's current and former students also submitted a letter urging the museum to hold on to the curator.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHelgen continued to contest Johnson's ruling, and in December, the museum reversed the decision, clearing Helgen's disciplinary record.\\n\\nAround the same time, the mammalogist was offered a tenured position as professor of biological sciences at the University of Adelaide, his alma mater. He will move to Australia with his wife, Lauren Helgen, a fellow National Museum of Natural History mammalogist, and their young son."}
{"original": "Customers who travel with a smart bag must be able to remove the battery in case the bag has to be checked at any point in the customer's journey, American Airlines said in a statement. If the battery cannot be removed, the bag will not be allowed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe rule springs from safety concerns. Lithium metal and lithium ion/polymer batteries are susceptible to emitting smoke, catching fire and even exploding. Between March 1991 and May 2017, the Federal Aviation Administration documented 160 incidents involving lithium batteries that were being transported as cargo or baggage. The agency already prohibits passengers from checking spare lithium batteries used for personal electronic devices and portable rechargers, as well as several lithium-powered items such as e-cigarettes and vape pens. The FAA permits the items inside the cabin. (For information on flying with hazardous materials, see the FAA's Pack Safe guidelines.)\\n\\nThe airlines are not snubbing all smart bags: Luggage with extractable batteries is permitted, with some oversight. Passengers who check their smart carriers must remove the battery and tote it onboard. As carry-on, the battery can stay put but must be turned off, per FAA protocol. However, if a flight attendant decides to gate-check the bag, you must remove the battery before it goes into the belly of the plane.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSmart luggage performs more than beast-of-burden duties. Depending on the model, the brainy bag might come with USB ports for charging gadgets, GPS tracking, electronic locks and built-in digital scales. One company called Modobag allows travelers to zoom around on their luggage like a scooter, which tops out at 8 mph. Many manufacturers, such as Away, Barracuda, G-Ro, Raden, Arlo Skye, Travelpro and Heys (the only maker to use AAA batteries), sell smart luggage that complies with the new rule. The ones that do not are rethinking their designs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLuggage manufacturers are already responding to airlines' safety concerns, said Michele Marini Pittenger, president of the Travel Goods Association. The recent attention surrounding lithium ion batteries will surely lead to action by manufacturers to make new iterations of smart luggage as safe as possible.\\n\\nThe rule came earlier than expected. The International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. agency that sets aviation safety standards and recommends practices for more than 190 countries, had decided to start restricting smart luggage next January. However, the International Air Transport Association, which represents about 275 airlines worldwide, instituted the ban a year early. An IATA spokesman said the organization's members will follow its recommendations starting Monday. Participants include major carriers such as United, JetBlue, KLM and Virgin Atlantic, as well as many smaller airlines, including Slovenia's Adria Airways, Egypt's Nile Air and Iran's Kish Airlines.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConsider yourself warned: If you arrive at the airport with the luggage non grata, the airline will not permit the piece onboard. You will have to repack your belongings in your secondary bags or purchase new luggage at the airport — a costly solution for a careless mistake."}
{"original": "I'm glad we can finally get back to work here, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said after the vote. He called the shutdown a manufactured crisis characterized by damaging partisan theatrics.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe breakthrough came Monday after Senate Democrats bowed to pressure to reopen the government, joining Republicans in backing an immigration and spending compromise that was quickly denounced by liberals and immigration activists.\\n\\nAD AD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRoughly 60 hours after government funding lapsed, a bipartisan group of negotiators in the Senate prevailed with leadership and trading Democratic support for reopening the government for a commitment by Republicans to hold a vote resolving the status of young undocumented immigrants by mid-February.\\n\\nPresident Trump welcomed Democrats' decision to relent and said the administration would work toward solving the problem of very unfair illegal immigration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI am pleased that Democrats in Congress have come to their senses, he added in a statement.\\n\\nAfter the Senate voted on Jan. 22 to reopen the government, The Fix's Aaron Blake examines what Democrats lost and won in their standoff over DACA. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\\n\\nBut the resolution of the three-day stalemate exposed a growing rift between two groups of Democratic senators: those facing tough reelection campaigns in states Trump won, and those courting liberal voters ahead of possible 2020 presidential bids.\\n\\nChanneling rage from immigration activists, the possible 2020 candidates were highly critical of their leaders' willingness to trust that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will allow an immigration vote after Feb. 8 if senators cannot strike a deal before then.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI believe it's been a false choice that's been presented between keeping the government open and resolving the DACA issue, said Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who voted no. I believe we can do both.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA majority of Democrats had forced the shutdown with demands for a vote on legislation to protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, known as dreamers, from deportation after Trump canceled the program. The final bill did not include these protections, nor any specific guarantee of a vote.\\n\\nOther possible White House contenders who voted against the bill included Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).\\n\\nDemocratic and independent senators who relented in the standoff said they did not necessarily trust McConnell, but had faith that the bipartisan negotiators, including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), would force him to abide by his commitments.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrankly, our trust is more with our colleagues, that they will hold him accountable, said Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who is up for reelection this year in a state Trump won.\\n\\nA commitment this public, with this much fanfare — that's kind of hard to back away from just three weeks from now, said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who sided with Democrats on Friday in the vote that produced the shutdown.\\n\\nCollins, Flake and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) helped broker the agreement, with Flake and Graham shuttling between huddles with McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for much of the weekend. During bipartisan meetings in Collins's office, senators had to use a talking stick to avoid unproductive crosstalk. They eventually switched to a basketball, according to Manchin, because it was easier to toss back and forth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcConnell had said Sunday night and Monday morning that it was his intention to take up legislation addressing DACA, border security and other issues if Democrats agreed to fund the government until Feb. 8.\\n\\nThis immigration debate will have a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides, he said Monday.\\n\\nThe effects of the shutdown over the weekend were relatively muted: halting trash pickup on National Park Service property, canceling military reservists' drill plans, switching off some government employees' cellphones.\\n\\nBut the shutdown's continuing into Monday meant that hundreds of thousands of workers stayed home and key federal agencies were affected. Federal contractors will see payments delayed, and the Internal Revenue Service will slow its preparations for the coming tax season.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSenators did not extract a promise from McConnell that would pave the way for an immigration bill's passage through the House or its approval by Trump.\\n\\nStill, some Democratic senators said the deal created the conditions for success.\\n\\nYou have to be optimistic that we are trusting each other and trusting the process we are putting in place and that over the next 17 days, we will get to a bill that can get a commanding vote in the Senate, not just barely pass, Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said.\\n\\nThis, combined with legislation to address a bevy of other issues — long-term spending levels, disaster relief and funding for opioid treatment and community health centers — would create unstoppable pressure on the House, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAdvocates for dreamers were less convinced.\\n\\nRep. Luis V. Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) blasted his Democratic colleagues in the Senate for shortchanging Latino voters, an increasingly critical voting bloc for the party.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the Republicans said we are ending same-sex marriage, but we promise Democrats a vote later; or we approve of oil drilling in every national park, but you'll have a vote later — do you think the Democrats would say yes? This shows me that when it comes to immigrants, Latinos and their families, Democrats are still not willing to go to the mat to allow people in my community to live in our country legally, said Gutierrez, one of Capitol Hill's most vocal advocates for dreamers, in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA top liberal political strategist on immigration issues spoke for many of those in an uproar after the vote.\\n\\nWe're pissed off. We're not naive to the politics. But give me a f-----g break. They do something heroic Friday night they climb down Monday morning, the strategist said.\\n\\nSenate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he hoped to be celebrating with DACA recipients after a possible victory in three weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo all the 'dreamers' watching today: Don't give up, he said on the Senate floor. I know your lives are hanging in the balance.\\n\\nThe vote to end debate on the spending bill came together quickly after Collins and several other senators said they wanted a firmer, more detailed commitment from McConnell.\\n\\nIt would be helpful if the language were a little bit stronger because the level of tension is so high, Collins told reporters outside her office.\\n\\nA Republican aide involved in the talks said that McConnell and his team were considering putting their plan in document form with more detail as a way of convincing some Democrats to support the short-term bill.\\n\\nAhead of the vote to end debate, Schumer warned McConnell to keep his word.\\n\\nI expect the majority leader to fulfill his commitment to the Senate, to me and to the bipartisan group, and abide by this agreement. If he does not . . . he will have breached the trust of not only the Democratic senators, but members of his own party as well, Schumer said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, the relief among senators upon reaching a deal was palpable. As the voting began, Schumer shouted from his seated position. Lindsey! Thank you, my friend, he said as Graham approached and shook his hand. We wouldn't be here without you.\\n\\nWith the negotiations focused on the Senate, Trump remained on the sidelines for much of the weekend, using Twitter to interject his opinions.\\n\\nDemocrats are acting at the behest of their far left base in advocating for dreamers, he argued Monday morning."}
{"original": "Del. Dan K. Morhaim improperly advocated for changes to medical marijuana policies without publicly disclosing that he was a paid consultant to a prospective cannabis dispensary, according to a report by the ethics committee of the Maryland General Assembly obtained by The Washington Post.\\n\\nThe Joint Committee on Legislative Ethics found that Morhaim did not violate disclosure laws or intentionally use his perch as a lawmaker for his own financial benefit.\\n\\nBut it concluded that Morhaim's actions nevertheless were improper and contrary to the principles of state ethics law.\\n\\nThe lawmakers on the committee recommended that the House of Delegates pass a resolution disapproving of Morhaim's actions and urged the 22-year delegate to publicly apologize.\\n\\nMorhaim (D-Baltimore County) promptly did so, sending a letter to his colleagues in which he apologized for bringing the House of Delegates and himself into a negative light in the public media.\\n\\n[Read the letter of apology from Del. Morhaim]\\n\\nThe Post first revealed Morhaim's dual roles in July, prompting the months-long inquiry from the ethics panel, which hired outside counsel to assist in the effort.\\n\\nThe resulting report, submitted to House Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) on Thursday, says Morhaim leveraged his influence as a lawmaker to advocate for policies that could have resulted in gains for himself.\\n\\nIt specifically noted how he pushed medical marijuana regulators to lift a cap on the number of licenses awarded to processing facilities while the company with which he was affiliated was seeking such a license. That company, Doctor's Orders, later said it did not support the proposed change.\\n\\nHis belief that he could keep his role as a legislator advocating for the implementation of policy and regulations for the use of medical cannabis, separate from his position as a paid consultant for a company seeking to enter the medical cannabis business reflects poor judgment to the detriment of the broader interests of the public, and it has eroded the confidence and trust of the public and other governmental officials who work with legislators, bringing disrepute and dishonor to the General Assembly, the report states.\\n\\n[Read the ethics committee's report]\\n\\nMorhaim — an emergency room physician who led the effort to legalize medical cannabis long before being hired by the company — says his advocacy was motivated by his desire to make marijuana available to patients, not to enrich his company.\\n\\nHe wrote on disclosure forms in July 2015 that he may do cannabis consulting and that he had received income that year for unspecified consulting work.\\n\\nMaryland law generally does not require lawmakers to name their consulting or legal clients on such forms, and Morhaim did not disclose his relationship as a consultant and prospective medical director for Doctor's Orders.\\n\\nThe ethics committee's report said the income he received from the company for work in 2015 was substantial.\\n\\nMorhaim declined to answer questions from The Post about his business dealings in medical marijuana for months, until the news organization obtained a portion of the dispensary application by Doctor's Orders that touted his involvement.\\n\\nMorhaim later told The Post that Dea Daly, the General Assembly's ethics adviser, had cleared his dual roles. But Daly told the ethics committee that Morhaim did not tell her that he was in contact with regulators from the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission after being retained by Doctor's Orders. Had she known, she told the committee, according to the report, she would have advised him to cease those communications.\\n\\nDelegate Morhaim's failure to disclose and be transparent undermines the public's confidence in an independent legislature, the ethics committee report says.\\n\\n[How Morhaim shaped — and joined — the medical marijuana industry ]\\n\\nIn his letter to lawmakers, Morhaim said he made mistakes and failed to appreciate public perception of these issues.\\n\\nWhile I have consistently maintained — and do today — that I did nothing wrong and complied with all laws, that was not enough, Morhaim wrote. The harsh fact is that being technically right is not enough. But Morhaim, who declined additional comment on the report, also said in his letter that he remains unsure about what he did wrong. I am concerned about the fairness of a process that penalizes members who comply with the clear letter of the law, but who can be found to violate the 'spirit' of the law.\\n\\nAlex Hughes, chief of staff to Busch, said the House of Delegates will consider the committee's recommendation for a disapproval resolution Friday.\\n\\nMorhaim says he has steered clear of legislation affecting the medical marijuana industry during the current legislative session. Busch has removed him from the House committee that considers bills affecting the health-care industry.\\n\\nThe ethics committee report says Morhaim plans to disassociate himself when legally permissible from Doctor's Orders, which last year won preliminary approval from the commission to operate a dispensary.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has proposed legislation to bar lawmakers from working on bills affecting their employers and to strip the legislature's power to police ethical conflicts, said the proposed penalty does not go far enough.\\n\\nSweeping these problems under the rug undermines public trust in our institutions of government, Amelia Chassé said."}
{"original": "It mattered to Jerome, in part, because the private for-profit college that he runs is subject to all three, and he had been advocating on repayment rates since 2014. And though the Scorecard more than doubled the repayment rates at Monroe, he alerted education officials.\\n\\nThat was August. This month, the Education Department said it corrected a coding error in the Scorecard that undercounted people who did not pay down the balance on their undergraduate student loans. As a result, the repayment rates for most colleges and universities were inflated.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter discovering the coding error, the department worked to get accurate, refreshed data out as soon as possible, not waiting until the next annual Scorecard update to do so, said Lynn Mahaffie, a senior official in the Education Department, in statement identifying the mistake.\\n\\nJerome said he found that statement a bit incredulous, considering that he told the agency something was up with the data months earlier. In a letter to the department reviewed by The Washington Post, the college president questions whether the Scorecard data are accurate, citing research to the contrary from the Brookings Institution. He also points out large variations in the three-, five- and seven-year repayment rates listed on the Scorecard. Instead of rates improving each year as borrowers' earnings increase, they went down and then back up, he wrote.\\n\\nThe letter was submitted as a comment in response to the proposed overhaul of borrower defense to repayment, a statute that wipes away federal loans if a school used illegal or deceptive tactics to persuade students to borrow money for college. One of the requirements of the proposed rule called on for-profit colleges with poor repayment outcomes to warn current and prospective students, a stipulation that Jerome argued should be extended to all schools and should at least be based on accurate information, not the flawed data from the Scorecard.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's a counterintuitive anomaly with the data that needs closer inspection and verification by the Department before it implements penalties associated with a five-year repayment rate, Jerome wrote, in a comment letter dated Aug. 1. He said he followed up with the department in October to no avail. When the final rule came out in late October, it used a repayment metric that still largely aligned with the Scorecard.\\n\\nIn an interview, Jerome said he suspects the department made errors in the data in its rush to push out a well-intentioned but ill-conceived rule before time ran out on the administration.\\n\\nHe added: The corrected data makes clear that the problem of repayment rates is universal, with less than half of all borrowers paying down principal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEducation Department officials declined to comment for this article.\\n\\nSome say the error speaks to the growing pains of the Obama administration's college search tool. The Scorecard is an invaluable resource for families researching colleges and loan repayment rates, according to the department, are an important measure of quality. But for months, anyone comparing schools got a distorted picture of student outcomes, and that distortion was pretty significant.\\n\\nRobert Kelchen, an assistant professor of higher education at Seton Hall University, found a roughly 20-point decline in the overall national repayment rate three years out, a 14 percent drop at the five-year mark and a 9 percent decline seven years out.\\n\\nThis error is significant, because the College Scorecard received millions of page views with incorrect information for more than a year, Kelchen said. The Department of Education should have had procedures in place to dig into a few colleges' data to check for larger errors.\\n\\nIn announcing the error, Mahaffie, at the Education Department, said the agency has added a number of quality assurances and reran some of its prior tests to ensure the new rates are correct."}
{"original": "These sorts of women are the subject of Roxane Gay's new short story collection, Difficult Women. Her characters are not avatars of girl power or women who have been labeled troublesome simply because they exhibit the same levels of ambition and self-protection that would be considered normal in a man. Sometimes they're prickly, but they're generally not hellcats. Often, they take out much of their rage and shame on themselves.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe rainstorms that rage around a woman rot the rooms she lives in. Gay's characters buy moldy tomatoes and settle for men who seem like compromises (or who will choke or bite them) and seduce their father's mistresses. When they're raped as children, they eat with the express intention of distorting their bodies so that they will be rendered untouchable. They butcher deer and slice open bodies with their fingernails. And they mourn their lost children in ways that make others uncomfortable. When the car ran him over, I did not look away, one character recalls of the accident that killed her child. I saw what happened to my boy's body. I saw everything, all of him, everywhere.\\n\\nThis is the greatest strength of Difficult Women: The collection makes us look at things we'd rather avoid. If Bad Feminist, Gay's 2014 essay collection, was a comfort, encouraging women to ease up on themselves when judging their own enthusiasm and inconsistencies, Difficult Women is a challenge, at times as sharp and as dirty as that fingernail slicing through layers of skin and fat.\\n\\nAnd specifically, one of the things Difficult Women makes readers look at is fat itself. In one story, a couple find themselves turned on by watching shows about the health challenges of morbidly obese people. I narrate in explicit detail how the fat is yellow and serpentine and pulpy and slick, a character explains. The woman with the knife-sharp fingernails describes the fat, yellow, soft globes that fall away loosely she cuts through when she delivers her sister's child. I don't cut the fat from meat anymore, another character explains. I love to eat it, love to feel it hot and salty and gelatinous between my teeth. I love the way it coats my throat and how it upsets my stomach, reminds me I am doing something I should not do.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe tendency in feminist discussions of fat is often to encourage us to see the person who lives inside a fat body, or to focus on the social and genetic conditions that produce fat rather than the substance itself. Those approaches are critically important to eliminating discrimination based on body size and advancing the policy goals that will get more people access to healthy food and appropriate medical care. But, as Gay's writing suggests, these arguments don't achieve a confrontation with a contradiction at the heart of our thinking about fat: that we love the taste of something that disgusts us so much."}
{"original": "But with lackluster oil prices and an increasing number of banks saying they would not finance Arctic energy projects, major oil companies did not try to buy the leases. That left the state agency, Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, as the main bidder. The agency put up all but two of the winning bids, which went to a couple of small energy firms.\\n\\nThe sale of 11 tracts on just over 550,000 acres netted $14.4 million, a tiny fraction of what Republicans initially predicted it would yield. Only two of the bids were competitive, so nearly all of the land sold for the minimum price of $25 an acre.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInterior Deputy Secretary Kate MacGregor, who stood before a camera and read the bids out loud as she pulled them out of manila folders, announced at the start of the sale, Today is truly historic. Noting that many people had spent years working to open the refuge up to drilling, she said, Thank you for your grit and for your determination.\\n\\nWhile a 2017 law compels the government to auction another several hundred thousand acres by the end of 2024, the incoming administration may be able to overturn that requirement now that Democrats have won control of the Senate in the wake of Tuesday's runoff elections in Georgia.\\n\\nA coalition of environmental and conservation groups tried to block the sale on the grounds that the administration had cut corners in crafting the leasing program, but U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason denied their request for a preliminary injunction Tuesday evening.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will offer drilling rights to most of the refuge's nearly 1.6 million-acre coastal plain, which attracts hundreds of thousands of migrating caribou and waterfowl each year and provides critical habitat for the Southern Beaufort Sea's remaining polar bears. As sea ice on the Arctic Ocean abutting the refuge shrinks, the bears — threatened with extinction due to climate change — have been forced to spend more time on land. Federal scientists estimate that a third of the bears' maternal dens lie within the area the administration has opened up for energy development.\\n\\nThe refuge has become a rallying point for Republicans and environmentalists alike, who have fought for 40 years over whether to tap into the fossil fuels lying beneath it. The government estimates there could be 7.7 billion barrels of recoverable oil on the coastal plain, though seismic surveys have not been conducted since the 1980s. The BLM is in the process of letting the Kaktovik Iñupiat Corporation conduct seismic tests there this winter.\\n\\nThe sale marks the culmination of President Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling across the country, including in some of its most ecologically sensitive areas. On Monday, the BLM opened up an additional 7 million acres for leasing on the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, home to a critical calving area for tens of thousands of caribou and migratory feeding ground for hundreds of thousands of birds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump officials predict that extracting oil from the relatively pristine refuge, which supports 270 species, will require as many as four airstrips and major well pads, 175 miles of roads, vertical supports for pipelines, a seawater treatment plant and a barge landing and storage site. Drilling operations could last for nearly a half-century.\\n\\nA number of Alaska Native officials — including those in Kaktovik, which lies within the refuge's boundaries and has surface land rights next to the coastal plain — back energy development on the refuge. The Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, which holds 92,000 acres of subsurface mineral rights, has also backed drilling there.\\n\\nIn a federal court hearing Monday, where several environmental groups unsuccessfully sought a preliminary injunction to halt the lease sale, Tyson Kade — a lawyer for the North Slope Borough and Kaktovik — argued that such a move would cost Alaska Natives living in the region jobs and revenue. The Court should consider the interests of the people who actually live on the North Slope and the coastal plain, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the Gwich'in people, who have relied for centuries on the Porcupine caribou herd that migrates each year through the refuge, have joined with conservationists in opposing any drilling there.\\n\\nLast month the BLM withdrew nearly 475,000 acres from the auction, citing public concerns about drilling's impact on the caribou herd.\\n\\nGleason ruled Tuesday the auction could go forward because the Gwich'in and other plaintiffs — including the National Audubon Society and Natural Resources Defense Council have not established that they are likely to suffer imminent irreparable harm since drilling is not expected to commence immediately.\\n\\nIn their push to sell off our lands to the fossil fuel industry, the Trump administration has engaged in a corrupt process and disrespected and dismissed the Indigenous people, said Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich'in Steering Committee. We will continue to fight this illegal sale in court, and we call on President-elect Biden to act immediately to protect our lands from destructive drilling once and for all.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOpponents have also launched a public campaign to deter major financial institutions and energy firms from investing in such a project. America's six largest banks and Canada's five biggest banks have all pledged not to back energy exploration on the refuge.\\n\\nWhen asked recently whether Royal Dutch Shell planned to bid, the company's chief executive Ben van Beurden said Oh, no, no, no. Shell bought leases in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska in 2008 and spent more than $7 billion only to drill a dry hole in 2015.\\n\\nWe believe that the oil and gas upstream part is a foundational piece of business for us, but we're going to be very selective on where we want to create value, van Beurden said. And I can tell you at the North Slope or offshore Alaska, it's not going to be part of that.\\n\\nOne major bank said it had asked clients with assets in the region whether they planned to bid and they said absolutely not, according to the bank's spokesman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect business relationships.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther potential bidders chose not to make offers. They included companies such as Hilcorp, which last year bought up all of BP's properties in Alaska's North Slope; Oil Search, an exploration company focused largely on Alaska; and Conoco Phillips, a sizable oil company that has made some discoveries on National Petroleum Reserve Alaska, west of the refuge.\\n\\nBut BLM Alaska Director Chad Padgett called the auction very successful, adding that it was not surprising there wasn't more interest. It's an area that's unknown.\\n\\nAnxiety about the possibility that no one would bid on the leases in the refuge prompted former governors Bill Walker and Frank Murkowski to write op-eds urging the state to place bids on the leases so that the state could sell or give the leases to oil companies to keep development moving. On Dec. 23, despite calls to spend the money elsewhere, the AIDEA board voted to spend up to $20 million, enough to buy 800,000 acres at the $25 rock bottom minimum price.\\n\\nWhile Congress projected in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017 that the lease program would raise $1.8 billion in revenue for the federal government, officials now say it will raise half that, and it could be even less. Justice Department lawyer Paul Turcke estimated Monday the sale would generate many millions of dollars split evenly between Alaska and the federal government.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere has been little competition for leases on the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, where companies have operated for years. More than 90 percent of the leases sold since 2012 received just a single bid. In eight of the past nine years, there was not a single competitive bid on the reserve.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has indicated he opposes any development on the refuge: On Tuesday, a senior transition official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he has yet to take office said of the auction: It is just a sham, and a poke in the eye.\\n\\nIt remains unclear how much Biden can restrict drilling given the legal mandate to hold another auction by the end of 2024, though Democrats may be able to overturn this provision now that they have won both of Georgia's Senate seats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDrew Caputo, Earthjustice's vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans, noted that the Bureau of Land Management is supposed to hold quarterly auctions on its lands but can defer them repeatedly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 2017 tax law is way more prescriptive than BLM rules that cover oil and gas lease sales, Caputo said, adding Biden will have a binding obligation to conduct a lease sale on the refuge by the end of his first term unless the law is changed before then. That mandate is not an excuse for other legal violations, like inadequate environmental analysis.\\n\\nThere are four separate lawsuits challenging the administration's environmental analysis of the proposed drilling program.\\n\\nFrank Macchiarola, senior vice president of policy, economics and regulatory affairs for the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email that the environmental review at issue confirmed the potential to develop the area safely, and any company that chooses to invest will be held to the world's highest environmental standards."}

{"original": "With a good brush and stomp, doormats can prevent debris, wet snow and dripping rainwater from entering your home, says Lindsey Handel, a buyer for the garden and home store Terrain in Pennsylvania.\\n\\nDoormats may help with a comprehensive allergy-fighting plan, too, says Stephen Kimura, a board-certified ­allergist in Pensacola, Fla. If you're going to wear your shoes in the house, at least wiping them is going to help some. We've got pollen season now year-round, so these measures are important.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKimura's family doesn't wear shoes indoors, but they do have inexpensive washable cotton mats with rubber backings at each door to catch crud and set shoes on. The right doormat for your house depends on whether it will be completely exposed or under a ­covered porch.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor exposure, Handel recommends coir; for covered exposure, she says you can go for a less-durable jute-and-coir mix. The best thickness ­depends on whether the mat is inside or outside.\\n\\nIt's nice to have a softer and thinner rug inside and a more bristly, durable one outside, says Joy Cho, of California design studio Oh Joy . We dug up more dirt on doormats to deliver you five options chosen by experts. Welcome home to a cleaner house.\\n\\nAlthough Cho, with two children, has a no-shoe policy at home, she considers doormats a decorative and a fun way to greet guests and help catch dirt, water and snow before shoes are placed inside the door. If you have one main entry, Cho says to go with one you really love that makes a statement or has a fun greeting. For any secondary entries, she suggests coordinating the look of those mats: They could all be exactly the same for consistency or just have a similar vibe. For interior entryways, she recently designed some washable interior entry rugs for Lorena Canals. For exterior doors, she likes vinyl Chilewich mats, which are mold-, mildew- and chlorine-resistant, with a water-blocking, slip-resistant vinyl backing. The company's latest design — Simple Stripe ($55, chilewich.com) — has a functional stripe made of PVC yarns that scrape away debris.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTerrain's Handel says that in most climates, the fiber coir, which is made from the husk of a coconut, is best for exterior doormats that are exposed to the weather. The thicker and scratchier the doormat you can find, the better, she says, for scraping off dirt. She prefers a knot-patterned weave doormat for its classic look. These can be found almost everywhere, including Home Depot, which has the Entryways Knot-Ical handwoven coconut-fiber doormat ($38.57, homedepot.com).\\n\\nIn the Midwest and Northeast, doormats need to be winterproof. The Chicago-based co-founders of the Everygirl Media Group, Alaina Kaczmarski and Danielle Moss, both use coir doormats to dust off the snow. The bristles absorb moisture and actually catch the snow as you brush your feet off, Kaczmarski says. Coir doesn't always last past a season, but she says it's worth buying because coir is best at snow removal. Both Kaczmarski and Moss like coir mats from Williams-Sonoma, such as the French stripe doormat ($59.95, williams-sonoma.com).\\n\\nFor a multiseason mat that can handle whatever winter throws at it, try a lobster-rope mat, says Lisa Myers, owner of home-goods store Capers in Seattle. They work to shed the water and they have a little bit of coarseness to the rope that takes the dirt off, Myers says. She highlights the Rope Co.'s doormats, handmade in Maine by fifth-generation lobstermen ($65-$129, theropeco.com). They're super durable. I had a similar one for many years and I just hosed it down and it keeps looking great.\\n\\nI've used rope mats on several projects, usually beach or summer homes, says Josh Linder, owner of Evolve Residential in Boston. They are a fun first peek into the interior of the home, but also are incredibly rugged and well wearing, he says. Rope, made for the oceans . . . is intended to take a beating. He likes Rockport Rope's mats, which come in a variety of sizes ($39.99-$389.99, rockportdoormats.com)."}
{"original": "The U.S. Postal Service has been under siege for months as record volumes of holiday packages and election mail ran up against a spike in coronavirus cases within its workforce, leaving the agency severely short-staffed. Nearly 19,000 workers were in quarantine at the end of 2020 after becoming infected or exposed to the virus, according to the American Postal Workers Union.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat has left hundreds of small publishers struggling to deliver their products, according to the National Newspaper Association, undercutting their advertising revenues and subscriber bases, and depriving the largely rural communities they serve of crucial news coverage. Some news operations have even called on reporters and editors to deliver papers.\\n\\nThey're also staring down rate increases of as much as 9 percent in 2022 and for years thereafter. Mail service is already one of their biggest costs, industry insiders say, and such a scenario could force hundreds of small publications out of business given their already bite-size margins.\\n\\nThese are little, tiny rural communities, and typically papers like mine are the only sources of information about that community, said Brett Wesner, chair of the National Newspaper Association and publisher of Wesner Publications, which includes 12 titles in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Most don't have digital coverage of any kind. Most don't have radio stations. We are the source of community information, both in terms of covering community events but also the city council, the school board, the county commission.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo delays are concerning, he said. And people are willing to make allowances today for that but not forever.\\n\\nNewspapers have relied on the Postal Service since its founding 245 years ago. The first postmaster general, Benjamin Franklin, was himself a news publisher and the founder of several periodicals.\\n\\nPublishers like Wesner pay the Postal Service 22 to 36 cents for each copy it delivers, based on whether it's staying within state lines. That's at least 35 percent less than the cost of a letter, greeting card other first-class mail.\\n\\nBut the agency is poised to raise prices after losing $9.2 billion in 2020 due to steep, pandemic-related declines in mail volume. It also has $116.6 billion in liabilities, the bulk of which is tied to pension obligations. Leaders have long sought to raise new revenue and, in 2021, it's slated to push through its first big postage rate increase in more than a decade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Postal Service will get an annual rate increase tied to inflation, plus a corresponding bump based on the growing number of delivery points mail carriers must visit six days a week. It can charge more each year when it begins paying down its liabilities (something it hasn't done since 2011), and can charge 2 percent for each mail product that doesn't cover its own costs.\\n\\nFor periodicals, mailing industry insiders say, the price changes could add up to nearly 9 percent compounded annually.\\n\\nThat's a scare for us, said Tonda Rush, the National Newspaper Association's director of public policy. No one has the money to stomach those cost increases.\\n\\nLarger newspapers generally hire scores of part-time workers to deliver newspapers. The mail service is more cost-effective for smaller publications, which can rack up additional discounts by delivering them to postal facilities on their own and presorting items in the sequence of a letter carrier's route, allowing postal workers to pick up the newspaper bundle and start their routines.\\n\\nStill, postage is one of a local newspaper's largest expenses, after payroll and newsprint. And when newspapers arrive late, there can be financial consequences: Advertisers demand refunds. Patrons cancel their subscriptions. And small newspapers — Wagner's publications circulate to roughly 6,000 people — don't generate much money from online ads.\\n\\nThe plight of the news industry is well-documented: The rise of the Internet in the 1990s gutted a business model that had largely gone unchanged for generations. News organizations tightened their belts by cutting editions, producing thinner papers and laying off staff.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJournalists at community papers often fill many roles: They write and edit their own copy, take photos and video, and layout pages, making it difficult to find new places to cut.\\n\\nThe problem with most newspapers is that we're willing to cannibalize ourselves in order to maintain our profit margins, Wagner said.\\n\\nMatt Paxton, fourth-generation publisher of the 6,000-circulation News-Gazette in Lexington, Va., said the delivery issues began over the summer. That syncs with cost-cutting underway at the mail service, where Postmaster General Louis DeJoy had ordered a crackdown on overtime hours, late and extra mail delivery trips, and other well-established measures.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDeJoy's agenda sent delivery rates spiraling. By August, periodicals had an on-time rate of 69 percent, an eight percentage-point drop in a matter of weeks. Performance rebounded over the fall, then fell again during the holiday season. It stood at 54 percent the week of Dec. 12, the most recent Postal Service data available.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Gazette-News has 550 subscribers who live outside the county, many scattered throughout western Virginia and along Interstate 81. As DeJoy's changes slowed mail all over the country, including backlogs of more than a week in some processing facilities, readers started calling Paxton saying their papers were not arriving.\\n\\nHe or one of his reporters will frequently drive a new copy out to a subscriber's home later in the day to find that not only did the resident not receive the newspaper — that person didn't receive any mail.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPostal Service spokesman David Partenheimer wrote in an emailed statement that the agency, like the rest of the shipping sector, continues to face near-term pressure on service performance because of holiday mail volume and employee shortages because of spiking coronavirus infections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAmid the historic volume, the Postal Service continues to flex its network, including making sure the right equipment is available to sort, process and deliver a historic volume of mail and packages this holiday season, Partenheimer wrote. Our entire operations team, from collections, to processing to delivery, worked throughout this past weekend and continues to work around-the-clock to address the historic volume.\\n\\nAs the delays mounted, Wagner started calling advertising clients offering them free ad space in future editions. His printing facility also produces 75 other regional and national newspapers; he called those clients to explain the issues.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome of Wesner's readers got three weeks' worth of papers delivered on the same day. He's spoken with local postal officials about the problems, but they've told him there's not much they can do. Plus, it's not like they haven't noticed, Wesner said. They live in the small towns within his coverage area, and frequently are not getting their papers either.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think they're trying, Wesner said, but with this quarantine and people getting sick, in these rural communities, you don't have a staff of 500 [at the post office]. The staff is tiny. You have people out, you're in trouble. I don't know of any recourse that we have. But if it does go on, we will find a recourse."}
{"original": "Since then? Unified governments are the exception. Since the new Congress of 1969, arriving in Washington with Richard M. Nixon, there have been eight new Congresses in which one party has held unified control — but in 2001, a senator's defection quickly meant that Republicans lost that advantage.\\n\\nThis point is better made visually, as are most points.\\n\\nTacked on at the end there is the newly christened 116th Congress, established this week and bringing to an end a brief period in which Republicans had control of both chambers and the White House.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe question that naturally follows is how this will affect the effectiveness of Congress. It makes intuitive sense that when one party controls the entire apparatus for passing legislation, more legislation would be passed. As it turns out, though, it's not quite that neat.\\n\\nGovTrack.us has data on the number of new laws enacted in each Congress since 1973. The peak over that period came in the 95th Congress, which took office in 1977 with Democratic President Jimmy Carter, a Democratic majority in the House and a Democratic majority in the Senate that topped 60 votes. Evidence, it would seem, for the utility of unified government. But, then, only slightly less legislation was passed in the four years prior.\\n\\nIt's murky. Since 1973, Congresses in which there was unified party control enacted an average of 541 new laws. Congresses in which there was a divide passed an average of . . . 533. That's a subtle distinction.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA good recent example is 2007, when Democrats who had won majorities in the 2006 midterms seized control of Capitol Hill. The number of laws enacted in that Congress trended downward, but it had in the 2005-2006 Congress, too.\\n\\nThere are any number of complicating factors that undergird this, of course: the willingness of either party to compromise, the willingness of a president to forge bipartisan agreements, the strength of either party's majority in the House and the Senate. The most recent Congress had a very narrow Republican majority and a fractured Republican caucus in the House, which, combined with President Trump's generally lackadaisical approach to policy, certainly didn't help things move forward.\\n\\nInterestingly, as GovTrack noted in an article wrapping up the most recent Congress, a handful of new laws were passed with more Democrats in support than Republicans, including major federal funding bills . . . and many laws contained provisions originally authored by Democrats. In a news release, the site noted that [s]ome of the most significant bills enacted in the last two years were supported more by Democrats than Republicans."}

{"original": "The District's Virginia suburbs are different from other parts of the state, a fact that got its latest confirmation Tuesday when the state Senate debated knives.\\n\\nSen. Richard H. Stuart (R-Stafford) sponsored a bill to make it legal to give dangerous knives to children. Specifically, a switchblade, Bowie knife or a dirk. Several members said they had to look up that last one — it's a straight-bladed dagger wielded by Scottish Highlanders.\\n\\nVirginia law already allows adults to give handguns to someone under age 18, as long as the child is a family member or it's for the purpose of engaging in a sporting event or activity. It prohibits those types of knives, however, and Stuart was proposing to change the language to mirror guns.\\n\\nIn Virginia a minor can use a shotgun to hunt deer, squirrel or other animals, Stuart said, but you couldn't give them one of these knives to skin it with.\\n\\nSen.

{"original": "For a long time, authorities at festivals in Australia and elsewhere almost entirely focused on preventing people from taking drugs in the first place. That approach has done little to drive down the number of drug-related deaths, however, and a mounting body of research suggests that pill-testing facilities might be a more promising strategy.\\n\\nSupporters of drug testing sites acknowledge that there is no safe level of drug consumption, and participants in those tests usually have to sign disclaimers acknowledging that. In some cases, assistance is provided only if participants also attend short counseling sessions on drug use.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFollowing last summer's trial effort in Canberra, organizers said they had successfully prevented attendees from unknowingly taking hazardous substances. But in other Australian states, local governments remain opposed, even amid a recent string of deaths.\\n\\nEvery time there is an event now, people are asking: why aren't you providing a pill testing facility? Why are people needlessly dying? said Gino Vumbaca, who works for one of the organizations involved in last year's test run, the International Harm Reduction Association.\\n\\nWhile the idea has recently gained more support, drug tests aren't new and have also been tried in some parts of the United States. Installing such facilities at music festivals has de facto been the norm in some European countries, including the Netherlands and Austria, for more than a decade. But amid more detailed research and increases in drug-related hospital admissions, supporters of drug tests are now also gaining momentum in Australia and New Zealand, where authorities have so far allowed only limited trials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think they're a fantastic idea and should be installed at all our festivals, New Zealand Police Minister Stuart Nash told news site stuff.co.nz, even though he cautioned that authorities still need to see how it works and better understand the implications of it first.\\n\\nThe war on drugs hasn't worked in the past 20 years, so it's time to change to a more compassionate and restorative approach, Nash said.\\n\\nCritics argue that the approach could encourage young people to take more drugs and that it sends the wrong message. On-site tests have also been criticized as inaccurate, given the sometimes limited availability of equipment.\\n\\nBut supporters of the tests maintain that their approach is far more effective than focusing on arrests. Pill testing has been shown to change the black market for the better and may even decrease overall drug consumption, as negative results would deter a majority of people from consuming drugs and spur them to warn their friends, according to a summary of arguments in favor of tests by Australia's parliamentary library. Research by the Global Drug Survey came to a similar conclusion last year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile police officers are not directly involved in those tests, authorities usually set up tolerance areas around testing tents, where consumers will not be arrested for drug use. Volunteers inside the tents use laboratory equipment to examine the substances in tests that take about half an hour on average using infrared light. The visual analysis can quickly reveal possible contamination or whether a drug consumer was sold a different drug.\\n\\nIn Britain, a study published last year in the International Journal of Drug Policy found that 20 percent of all drugs sold at a randomly chosen 2016 festival contained substances other than the ones dealers had declared.\\n\\nBy anonymously revealing those findings to affected festivalgoers, researchers persuaded more than two-thirds of them to hand over other substances in their possession. Drug-related hospital admissions fell 95 percent compared with the previous year — a trend researchers said was largely associated with the on-site drug testing trial. In a separate experiment, researchers in Austria similarly noticed that tests raised awareness about the dangers of drug consumption.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe research results were published months after drug-related hospital admission rates soared in certain countries. Whereas British consumers of MDMA (popularly known as ecstasy) had a 0.7 percent chance of being admitted to a hospital after taking the drug in 2016, the rate had more than doubled by 2017, according to the 2018 Global Drug Survey.\\n\\nGlobally, more than two thirds of all MDMA consumers interviewed for the survey said they would likely have used drug testing facilities if they had been available."}

So present it to your kids that way, instead of trying to come up with the definitive, parent-knows-best kind of message.\\n\\nTaking your example from where you left off, you could say: That wasn't the message I wanted to convey! It's important to be honest without being excessively so, and sometimes it's hard to figure out exactly where that line is.\\n\\nAnd then: I was caught off-guard just now and told a 'white lie' — that's when you lie about something trivial to protect a person's feelings.\\n\\nAnd then: What do you guys think, could I have given a better answer? If a friend didn't want to come to our house, what would you want that friend to say?\\n\\nThis isn't merely an elegant punt. It's a way for you to engage your kids in moral reasoning, to invest them in the way they choose to interact with others, to help them cultivate empathy, to learn from them yourself.\\n\\nThey might surprise you and say they'd rather friends just said they didn't want to come over today. (And really — is that so bad?) They might question your reflex to give a reason, since No, thanks is a perfectly valid response.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the bigger problem that white lies present than their dishonesty: They grow out of a boundary problem. Our time and choices and bodies are our own — so unless we're bailing out on an invitation we've already accepted, we don't need reasons to say no, and no one acquires entitlement to know our reasons just by inviting us somewhere.\\n\\nSo get your kids thinking, talking and phrasing their way toward a position of strength, where they resist padding no with justifications, real or manufactured, and do so with the kindest intent.\\n\\nDear Carolyn: My niece called off her wedding a few months ago and returned the gifts.

Once he has it, vote for him in November.\\n\\nPlenty of Republicans see President Trump's moral and political failures clearly. About 10 percent of Republican voters believe Trump should be removed from office. Those voters will be up for grabs in the 2020 election. They should be relieved that Biden is the Democratic front-runner right now.\\n\\nFor one thing, Biden surely would score high on the have a beer with the guy electability test. Biden doesn't even drink beer, or any alcohol, but he's still able to inspire a sense of collegial good feeling. I saw as much at the November 2006 Return Day ceremony, a post-election tradition in Sussex County, Del., when politicians from both sides gather and literally bury a hatchet to symbolize goodwill. Lots of beer is consumed on Return Day, but one of the most convivial participants I saw was the teetotal Biden. Washington could use a few more old-school politicians who understand that spirit of bipartisanship.\\n\\nFor some Democrats, the idea of wooing dissatisfied Republicans is nauseating. Yet the best outcome for the country may require the left-of-center to find common ground with the right-of-center, especially on trade, immigration and foreign policy. The surest way for that to happen is for Biden to win the Democratic nomination and the White House.\\n\\nTrump has bludgeoned free-trade Republicans into temporary submission, but it's far from clear that they've forgotten basic economics. They may have lost some enthusiasm for trade deals, but the GOP wasn't the party of tariffs before Trump, and it won't be after Trump, when business interests can be expected to reassert their party influence.\\n\\nBut Republicans weren't alone in adjusting to Trumpian trade politics: Free trade has achieved record popularity among Democrats. It's possible that the end of the Trump era will see Democrats revert to their usual trade-wariness; most of the Democratic presidential contenders don't seem to match their constituents' enthusiasm for free trade. But the beginning of a Biden presidency could present a brief, shining opportunity for trade liberalization. He's certainly no fan of Trump's tariffs.\\n\\nImmigration policy presents another opening. The ugliness of the Trump administration's immigration policies might appeal to some parts of the GOP, but the president appears to be losing some Republicans on the issue. Between December 2018 and July 2019, for example, Republican support for accepting refugees from Central America climbed 10 points, to 24 percent, according to Gallup. Trump's anti-immigrant message works with his base but cuts against overall trends: Since 1999, Gallup says, Americans' support for keeping the immigration level the same or increasing it has climbed from 51 percent to 64 percent, with the biggest jump — from 10 percent to 27 percent — in support for raising the immigration numbers.\\n\\nOn immigration, as on trade, big business will push the Republican Party toward compromise. Biden, who released a detailed plan for immigration reform in December, would no doubt be ready to make a deal to finally modernize a dysfunctional system.\\n\\nForeign policy, too, could be a strong point for Biden among disaffected Republicans. In the fall, Trump's foreign policy was finally losing Republican support. That may rebound, temporarily, in the wake of the U.S. drone strike on Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq, but the past several days have made clearer than ever that there is no Trump foreign policy doctrine. There is, as ever, merely the cult of Trump.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Biden has been measured and thoughtful in his response to developments in the Middle East. If he continues to show strength — real moral strength, not performative macho aggression — on foreign policy, that, too, would appeal to Republicans.\\n\\nCountless Americans today are desperate for reconciliation and a semblance of normalcy. I've never voted for a Democrat, but Biden offers the possibility of just such a political recovery from the nightmare of the past few years. I invite my fellow restless Republicans to join me. After Nov. 3, the country could have a national Return Day to bury the hatchet and maybe raise a beer to toast the arrival of the post-Trump era."}
{"original": "Clinton Saw No Alternative to Airstrikes Before NATO's air campaign, CIA Director George J. Tenet had warned that the Serbs might respond by intensifying their ethnic cleansing. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nBy John F. Harris\\n\\nWashington Post Staff Writer\\n\\nThursday, April 1, 1999; Page A1 The warnings were there for President Clinton. For weeks before the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, sources said, CIA Director George J. Tenet had been forecasting that Serb-led Yugoslav forces might respond by accelerating their campaign of ethnic cleansing in the province of Kosovo – precisely the outcome that has unfolded over the past week. All during this time, U.S. military leaders were offering Clinton a corresponding assessment of their own. If the Serbs did launch such an assault, they said, air power alone would not be sufficient to stop it – precisely the analysis that NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, articulated publicly this week when asked what the military could do to halt the humanitarian disaster unfolding in the Balkans. But in the face of this advice, according to a variety of U.S. and European sources familiar with the decision-making, Clinton and his senior White House advisers pressed on with their planning for an air campaign. The group, participants said, never reassessed the fundamental judgment they had reached the previous fall, which ruled out the use of ground troops as a way of protecting Kosovo's majority Albanian population from a brutal crackdown by the Serbs. That judgment, which several administration officials said was arrived at easily and with little internal dissent, is now at the core of what could count as the most serious foreign policy crisis of Clinton's presidency. With more than a hundred thousand Albanians already driven out of Kosovo by Serb ethnic cleansing, and an unknown number killed, a central question is confronting Clinton: Why were his foreign policy aims not more closely matched with the military means necessary to achieve them? The essential answer, as offered by a variety of administration officials, is that Clinton never believed he had a viable alternative. The use of NATO ground troops, never a likely option, was expressly ruled out by the White House in October, when NATO military analysts produced a study that concluded it would take as many as 200,000 NATO troops to protect Kosovo on the ground. As several officials at the White House and at other national security agencies described it in recent days, that number was instantly viewed as a deal-killer. The numbers came in high, said one senior administration official. No one said yes, no one said no; it was taken off the table. . . . It was a complete eye-roller. The idea of troops never had any traction that I remember, said a senior White House official. NATO's analysis, officials said, was not a comprehensive study. Instead, it was an initial review that some U.S. officials called a SWAG – military parlance for a scientific wild-ass guess. The 200,000 figure, moreover, was at the high end of the estimates, and was contemplated for a scenario in which troops forcibly occupied all of Yugoslavia, a senior defense official said. If NATO went into only Kosovo in a non-permissive environment, the number of troops required would have been 75,000, an official said – troops that would enter after an air campaign similar to the sort that is now being carried out. Even a lower troop count, however, scarcely made the idea of a ground-based campaign more appealing to the Clinton White House – either before the air campaign began or now that it is being subjected to widespread second-guessing. This second-guessing, in fact, is prompting an increasingly sullen defense from many White House officials, who complain that Clinton is being held by commentators and political opponents to an impossible standard that is constantly shifting. If the United States had pursued a ground strategy, Clinton aides say, the administration would have been defying public opinion both here and in other NATO countries, and criticized for risking a military quagmire. If the administration had decided not to engage at all in Kosovo, Clinton would have been assailed for allowing the alliance to go limp in the face of a humanitarian disaster. The only alternative, as senior White House officials have described it this week, is to press on with a bombing campaign that has so far not proven capable of achieving the goal Clinton described in his speech to the nation the day the bombing began: to deter an even bloodier offensive against innocent civilians in Kosovo. Clinton, according to White House aides, always knew that this goal might prove unachievable with air power. That is why, they said, his speech included another aim: if necessary, to seriously damage the Serbian military's capacity to harm the people of Kosovo. Even if there were political support for using ground troops, the option is hardly more appealing to the White House. Clinton, sources said, is being advised by his national security advisers that inserting ground troops would be a virtually certain recipe for a costly, open-ended commitment in Kosovo and, possibly, all of Yugoslavia. Invade, occupy and stay there, one senior administration official said of what would happen if NATO troops go to Kosovo. You own this country. The thing that bothers me about introducing ground troops into a hostile situation, into Kosovo and into the Balkans, is the prospect of never being able to get them out, Clinton told CBS's Dan Rather in an interview televised last night. As the administration decides what to do next, it must also fend off a we-told-you-so debate within its own ranks. While White House officials said they always contemplated the possibility of a Serb assault, several people familiar with NATO planning said what has unfolded is decisively on the worst-case end of the spectrum. We underestimated the ferocity and velocity of [Serbian President Slobodan] Milosevic's offensive to transform the ethnic balance in Kosovo, said a senior NATO military source. A political-military plan prepared in October envisioned that Milosevic might accelerate ethnic cleansing, but also that he might yield quickly once force was applied, said one former administration official familiar with the planning. Different parts of the government put their faith in different scenarios. The military was always more cautious about air power than the State Department, the former official said. A State Department official responded: Our job is to pursue diplomatic options. Balkans policymakers in Foggy Bottom, this official said, believed that political objectives would not be achieved without a credible threat of force, but that does not mean that anyone was predicting [a] rosy scenario in which Milosevic would quickly back down. White House officials, meanwhile, are bristling at what they see as revisionist history from many retired military commanders commenting on the crisis, as well as at some whispered background comments from current officers – that the military had argued for keeping the ground option alive. They were the ones who were most against it, one senior administration official said. © Copyright 1999 The Washington Post Company Back to the top"}
{"original": "News for Democracy's potential violations may have included Facebook's community standards and advertising policies, the company said. Facebook's community standards emphasize authenticity and ban misrepresentation, including coordinated efforts to mislead people about the origin of content.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome of News for Democracy's pages inserted Democratic messages into the feeds of right-leaning voters, according to a review of Facebook's ad archive. News for Democracy ran ads touting Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.) on The Holy Tribune, a Facebook page targeted to evangelicals, the archive shows. Another page called Sounds Like Tennessee focused on local sports and news but also ran at least one ad attacking since-elected Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.).\\n\\nPeople start to trust the content emanating from the page, because it appeals to their interests, and once there is a certain degree of trust, you can start to pivot by slowly adding in kernels of disinformation or overly politicized information that lacks context, said Benjamin T. Decker, research fellow at the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who called such tactics an intentional act of deception that mimicked strategies of Russian operatives around the 2016 presidential election.\\n\\nDuring the 2018 midterms, News for Democracy helped create at least 14 Facebook pages and purchased the ads that ran on them, according to a person familiar with its operations who was not authorized to speak on the record. While the ads, cached in Facebook's public database, show that News for Democracy paid for them, the pages themselves — which are listed as news companies — do not disclose their backers or offer any identifying information beyond their name.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe pages also don't offer contact information for an administrator, a standard practice for news organizations and groups on Facebook.\\n\\nDmitri Mehlhorn, Hoffman's top political adviser and a board member of News for Democracy, declined to comment. Mehlhorn said in a previous interview that News for Democracy aimed to cultivate outreach to groups that were center [and] center-right, and trying to reach out to them with messages.\\n\\nThe News for Democracy pages were created by another start-up backed by Hoffman called MotiveAI, according to the person. MotiveAI declined to comment.\\n\\nIt is unclear who else is behind News for Democracy or when it started. Hoffman did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNews for Democracy is exposing potential gaps in the law and in Facebook's approach to fighting misinformation. Facebook pages, including those listed as news organizations, are not required to disclose identifying information beyond the page's name — unlike the requirement that buyers of political ads reveal their origins, a response to the Russian interference that dogged social media platforms during the 2016 election and afterward. Such disclosures are not required by law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA Facebook spokesman said the company was reviewing its approach. People connecting with [pages] shouldn't be misled about who's behind them, said Facebook spokesman Matt Steinfeld. Just as we've stepped up our enforcement of coordinated inauthentic behavior and financially motivated spam over the past year, we'll continue improving so people can get more information about the pages they follow.\\n\\nFacebook declined to comment on which policies the group may have violated. It has used its community standards and advertising policies to shut down attempts by Russian and Iranian agents to manipulate the American public on its platform.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNews for Democracy is the latest Hoffman-backed organization that has come under scrutiny in recent weeks. Last month, reports by The Washington Post and the New York Times found that an investment from the LinkedIn co-founder ended up funding an operation to spread disinformation during the 2017 special election in Alabama, though Hoffman said he did not endorse its tactics. The Daily Beast first reported on News for Democracy's pages in September.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe social network has poured significant resources into policing its platform since the Russia controversy, including doing some vetting of Facebook pages with large followings. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg recently said the reckoning with such abuses has fundamentally altered the DNA of the company. But the guardrails around what constitutes appropriate domestic conduct are less clear than for foreigners, who are prohibited from buying ads targeting U.S. elections.\\n\\nFacebook began its investigation of News for Democracy in December, after The Post first reported some details about the Alabama campaign, known as Project Birmingham. Facebook suspended at least one researcher involved, Jonathon Morgan, for violating its policies prohibiting coordinated inauthentic activity. That included the creation of a fake Facebook page that offered an endorsement of a write-in Republican candidate in the state's 2017 special election for Senate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDecker said that it was inauthentic and misleading for a left-leaning political operative to try to create communities of conservatives for the express purpose of sending those people political messages that would sway their thinking — and to use the label of a news organization to do so. Calling yourself a media organization creates some kind of degree of trust and authority, he said. It's harmful to the health of the digital public square, and should not have a place on Facebook.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the previous interview, Mehlhorn said that News for Democracy did not spread misinformation as part of its work. He disavowed disinformation as a tool for mobilizing American voters, but said that U.S. political groups could learn from Russia's troll army, the Internet Research Agency, and its use of microtargeting to reach narrow groups of voters.\\n\\nThe study by the New York University Tandon School of Engineering found that News for Democracy's ads garnered at least 16 million impressions, defined as views or clicks, over just a two-week period in September. The pages are still active."}
{"original": "Well, at least most of the time. Repeatedly since Joe Biden was declared the winner Nov. 7, Trump has momentarily acknowledged the likelihood — if not the fact — that Biden will be succeeding him as president later this month.\\n\\nHe did it twice Monday night at an otherwise defiant rally in Georgia.\\n\\nAt one point, he pitched the two U.S. Senate candidates he was there to support — Republicans Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue — as the last line of defense, given their losses would hand the Senate to Democrats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe damage they do will be permanent and will be irreversible, Trump said, referring to the two Democratic challengers. Can't let it happen. Nothing and no one will be able to stop them. These Senate seats are truly the last line of defense.\\n\\nThe thing is, though, that would hardly be the case if Trump won. That's both because Trump would still wield much power as president and because the Senate would stay under GOP control even if it lost both seats. Vice President Pence would break the tie in a 50-50 Senate.\\n\\nTrump immediately course-corrected, contradicting himself: Now, I must preface that by saying — because they'll say he just conceded! — no, no, I don't think so. So Kelly, if I might add, I think we're going to win, in which case we'll be the last line of defense. It's called veto, veto, veto, veto.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite Trump's protest, though, those two thoughts can't coexist. You can't say Loeffler and Perdue are truly the last line of defense and that nothing and no one will be able stop Democrats if they lost and then say there will be another way to stop Democrats and that that thing is actually the last line of defense.\\n\\nAt another point in the speech, Trump spoke about how a President Biden will interact with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\\n\\nI got along very well with Kim Jong Un, Trump said. I don't think that Joe's going to, based on what I've heard.\\n\\nThat wasn't the only time Trump has spoken about what will happen when Biden takes office as if it's a settled issue.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow that the Biden Administration will be a scandal plagued mess for years to come … he began a December tweet.\\n\\nTrump acknowledged on Dec. 5 that the next four years of foreign policy in China and Iran would be under someone else's control.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe happiest people in the world right now are the leaders of China. The second happiest are the leaders of Iran, Trump said. What we would've done in the next four years, we would have been on a footing like nobody's ever, and now we're giving it all away.\\n\\nIn a Dec. 22 address, he talked about what the next administration would have to do on coronavirus relief — and again appended a caveat.\\n\\nI am also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation and to send me a suitable bill, or else the next administration will have to deliver a covid relief package, Trump said, before adding: And maybe that administration will be me, and we will get it done.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Nov. 13, he floated the idea that the country might go into a lockdown. But it was a clear reference to Biden, because Trump explicitly ruled out his own administration doing that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIdeally, we won't go to a lockdown, Trump said, before adding: I will not go — this administration will not be going to a lockdown. Hopefully, whatever happens in the future — who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell. But I can tell you, this administration will not go to a lockdown.\\n\\nMany of these comments are similar — Trump saying something that acknowledges Biden's win and status as the incoming president and then seeming to catch himself. It's happened enough times that it's quite possible it's done for effect. It's also possible he's ad-libbing after being given a script that he decides goes too far in acknowledging Biden's win."}
{"original": "This supply-side approach has been in place at the federal level since the dawn of the drug war: The federal drug budget has traditionally emphasized approaches like destroying plants, intercepting drug shipments and arresting the people who sell drugs. The logic is straightforward: You reduce the supply of drugs, those drugs become more expensive, and the higher prices drive down demand and use of the drugs. Economics 101, right?\\n\\nIn the real world, it hasn't quite worked out that way. Here, for instance, is data on federal spending on supply-side drug control going back to 1981. The numbers are adjusted for inflation to 2012 dollars.\\n\\nIn inflation-adjusted terms, federal supply-side anti-drug spending ballooned from $2.2 billion in 1981 to $15.3 billion in 2012. You can disregard that crater in 2002 — a temporary change to the drug spending calculation was made that year, resulting in a number of significant spending lines removed from it.\\n\\nNow according to supply-side drug-control theory, increasing this spending should result in a concomitant increase in drug prices. But look what happened to heroin prices, in inflation-adjusted terms, over the same time period — they dropped like a rock.\\n\\nThe inflation-adjusted price per pure gram of heroin fell nearly tenfold, from $3,260 in 1981 to $465 in 2012. The more the feds spent on supply reduction, in other words, the cheaper heroin got (federal data shows that the prices of other drugs, like cocaine and methamphetamines, fell similarly during this period). That's the exact opposite of what's supposed to happen, and of what Comey says will happen if we crack down on the heroin supply further.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe relationship here may have some element of causality. For instance, federal supply-side pressures may have kept heroin just valuable enough to entice cartels and suppliers to keep devising new ways to push the drug into U.S. markets, driving prices down. You get this filtering effect decade after decade where you end up artificially selecting or breeding super-traffickers, Sanho Tree, a drug policy expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, told Vox earlier this year.\\n\\nMoreover, supply restraints have never really been a problem for the U.S. heroin market, according to Ethan Nadelmann of the Drug Policy Alliance, a drug law reform group.\\n\\nAll the heroin consumed in the US in a year could fit within something like one or two shipping containers, Nadelmann said. If there were demand for 10 times as much heroin [in the U.S.], it would rapidly be supplied. The limitation is not really on the production side.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo why the continued focus on supply-side policies? Part of it is that after 40 years, a staunch, no-compromises anti-drug culture is firmly entrenched in places like Comey's FBI and Rosenberg's DEA. Also, substance abuse treatment doesn't fall within the portfolio of law enforcement agencies.\\n\\nThis isn't to suggest that supply-side drug-control approaches should be abandoned. Some experts, like the Brookings Institution's Vanda Felbab-Brown, believe attempts to reduce the supply of illegal drugs can be effective if they're implemented smartly. But crucially, she says, supply-side approaches must accompanied by robust substance abuse treatment programs to reduce demand for drugs.\\n\\nThe supply-and-demand realities of the drug trade are why reform groups, like the Drug Policy Alliance, say that federal funds would be better spent helping drug users, rather than cracking down on drug suppliers. You can take out a heroin dealer, but the addictions he's feeding will remain. Another dealer will happily step forward to serve those addictions as long as demand remains."}

{"original": "The plan, which put incarcerated people in line for coronavirus immunization ahead of the elderly and those with chronic conditions, had been released by the state health department. It was the product of months of deliberation by members of the state's medical advisory group — physicians, public health officials and experts in bioethics. But their framework, when subject to the machinery of online outrage, quickly unraveled.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAsked by a Fox reporter about the prioritization, and the criticism touched off by the op-ed, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) said at a December news briefing there was no way the limited supply of shots would go to prisoners before it goes to people who haven't committed any crime. He let out a short laugh as he pronounced the word prisoners.\\n\\nAs promised, a revised version of the state's plan, released a week later without input from the advisory panel, put incarcerated people in no particular phase. It similarly demoted people living in homeless shelters and other congregate settings, while guaranteeing access for front-line workers and adults 70 and older as part of the priority group following medical workers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities.\\n\\nAs overcrowded prisons experience some of the nation's largest covid-19 outbreaks, a new report co-chaired by former U.S. attorneys general Loretta E. Lynch and Alberto Gonzales, is calling for correctional staff and incarcerated people to receive early access to vaccines. Gonzales said, The level, the rate of infection is so high and they have no way to deal with it…They desperately need it. (Washington Post Live)\\n\\nThe shift in Colorado offers an early sign that prisons and jails, which disproportionately hold people of color and have reported some of the most virulent coronavirus outbreaks, are creating daunting dilemmas for state leaders apportioning finite shares of the vaccine. The episode illustrates how a system of preferences geared to stop the virus where it is most destructive may clash with other values in a nation that incarcerates more people than does any other.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMore broadly, the makeup of the second tier is exposing sharply different priorities across the country, with some governors bucking expert advice to focus on vulnerable workers and high-risk living settings and instead rushing shots to the elderly.\\n\\nExperts advising Polis said they could not be sure why he discarded their recommendations to prioritize congregate living settings — he has not expounded on his thinking — but said they were troubled that he seemed to bow to criticism from political adversaries.\\n\\nPolis spokesman Conor Cahill declined to make the governor available for an interview but issued a statement defending the state's plan, stressing the moral obligation to prioritize elderly people most at risk of dying from the virus and front-line health-care heroes caring for the sick.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInmate status will not make a difference in terms of timing of receipt of the vaccine, Cahill said. Someone who falls into a category for early priority of the vaccine and is in custody will receive the vaccine at the same time as someone in the same category who is outside our correctional facilities.\\n\\nAbout a dozen states take a similar approach, according to a review of draft plans by the Prison Policy Initiative, a Massachusetts think tank. Several states, including New Jersey and Washington, have already begun vaccinating inmates. Another seven — Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Mexico and Pennsylvania — put incarcerated people after health-care workers and the residents and staff of long-term care facilities, according to the think tank.\\n\\nPlans in about half the states suggest inmates will gain access at some point ahead of the general population. But details are preliminary and subject to political winds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's a very stigmatized population, and there are people who say, 'They're in prison, they must have done something terrible, and they don't deserve a place in line,'  said Matthew Wynia, director of the Center for Bioethics and Humanities at the University of Colorado and a member of the state's medical advisory group. But viewing the priorities in terms of who deserves to be inoculated, he said, might end up prolonging the pandemic and killing more people.\\n\\nAnyone making a moralistic argument, Wynia said, should focus more on the math — 14 of Colorado's 15 largest outbreaks have occurred in prisons, jails or college dorms. Nationally, more than 40 of the 50 largest clustered outbreaks have occurred in jails and prisons, according to a call for urgent action published in the Lancet medical journal in October. Inmates live in crowded conditions and have high rates of hypertension, heart disease and other conditions linked to serious risk from covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. They are disproportionately Black and Hispanic, part of communities stricken by the pandemic.\\n\\nMore than 7,000 people in the care of the Colorado Department of Corrections have tested positive for the virus, and the state says 24 have died. Anuj Mehta, a Denver pulmonologist who chaired the advisory group addressing vaccine prioritization, said he thought Polis was operating on a principle of trying to save the most lives, though he disagrees with the governor's approach. Viral spread hardly stays within prison walls, he noted, mainly because corrections officers return to their families, often in minority and low-income communities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor these reasons, immunization experts tapped by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop federal recommendations to guide state planning have highlighted the needs of incarcerated populations and people living in homeless shelters. Guidance approved recently by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices put corrections officers in what is known as Phase 1b, along with other front-line workers and people aged 75 and older, recommending states immunize inmates at the same time or, depending on vaccine supply, in the next phase. Colorado's plan essentially strips them from that tier.\\n\\nAll these groups, in various facilities, are very vulnerable, said Sharon Frey, a committee member and clinical director of St. Louis University's Center for Vaccine Development.\\n\\nThe point was brought home in public testimony, when Joseph Bick, director of health-care services for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, told the CDC advisory group that, Prisons are essentially long-term care facilities with bars. California, where more than 40,000 inmates have been infected and about 130 have died, has already begun vaccinating some high-risk inmates. Officials have not yet decided how to prioritize the broader inmate population, said Ali Bay, a spokeswoman for the state health department.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA number of states place prison and jail staff ahead of inmates. Asked about the rationale for that approach, Gavin Lesnick, spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Health, said staff come and go from the facility and into the community and may have a higher risk. Shannon Litz, a state health department spokeswoman in Nevada, said the state considered chance of exposure to covid-19 and the guidance provided by federal partners.\\n\\nPeter Wagner, executive director of the Prison Policy Initiative, said it was difficult to spot trends among the states putting incarcerated people near the front of the line. Connecticut, Wagner said, is a big reformer, but some other states pursuing significant criminal justice reform have not publicly committed to early vaccination of inmates.\\n\\nIn Massachusetts, the priority given to incarcerated people stems from the broader focus on congregate settings, said Paul Biddinger, medical director for emergency preparedness at Mass General Brigham and chairman of the state's vaccine advisory group.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCongregate settings are congregate settings, and they are high density and at risk whether they're long-term nursing facilities or prisons, said another committee member, Massachusetts state Sen. Cindy Friedman (D). That inmates are in such dire need of inoculation, she said, shows the failures of criminal justice in America, revealing the extent of the breakdown and the gaps and the poor access to behavioral health care.\\n\\nBut the pandemic has put vows of reform to the test.\\n\\nIn remarks last year before the coronavirus began spreading out of control, Polis said he would like to see Colorado lead the nation in criminal justice reform. He issued an executive order in March allowing the Department of Corrections to reduce the state prison population, but the rule expired in May, and he faces litigation by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado accusing him and his corrections director of failing to protect vulnerable inmates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMark Silverstein, legal director of the state branch of the ACLU, said he initially thought Polis had made an error and misstated his own health department's plan when, responding to an interview question in Spanish, he said, Free people must receive it before incarcerated people.\\n\\nThe following week, the governor reiterated his position in even stronger terms, seemingly in response, Silverstein noted, to the position staked out by the Republican district attorney, George Brauchler.\\n\\nBrauchler said the Democratic governor had demoted inmates even more drastically than his Denver Post op-ed had demanded. Though outraged that his elderly father might be put in line after inmates, Brauchler, 51, said people locked behind bars should gain access before he does."}

Energy and technology were among the worst hit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSince Feb. 19, U.S. stocks have lost nearly $3.6 trillion in value.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs stocks nose-dived this week, calls have grown from prominent investors for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a move that usually calms markets. Wall Street traders are now betting on at least three rate cuts this year, including one rate reduction when the Fed meets next on March 18. Interest rates are currently just below 1.75 percent, a low level by historical standards, but higher than the rates in many other parts of the world.\\n\\nFed Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank would take action if the economy takes a hit from the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong. However, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity, Powell said. The Fed is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe flulike illness has infected more than 78,000 people in China and killed more than 2,700. Cases have been confirmed in more than 30 countries, and U.S. health officials say it is only a matter of time before it spreads here.\\n\\nSome investors were glad to see the end of February after the stomach-churning slides of the past several days.\\n\\nInvestors had a love-hate relationship with risk in the month of February, said Kristina Hooper, chief market strategist at Invesco. The first several weeks of the month saw investors embracing stocks. Then as worries grew about the coronavirus outbreak, market participants spent the past six trading days in panic mode. I suspect it will take reassurances from the Fed to stabilize markets.\\n\\nGlobal markets also took a beating. In Japan, the Nikkei tumbled 3.7 percent as officials declared a state of emergency in the northern island of Hokkaido and doubts were cast about this summer's Tokyo Olympics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng dived 2.5 percent, and the Shanghai composite skidded 3.7 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEuropean markets were in the same boat, into correction for the week.\\n\\nAs fears over the coronavirus mount, The Washington Post's Heather Long breaks down its impact on the stock market. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe travel sector was slammed: British Airways owner IAG tumbled more than 9 percent after it said it would cancel some flights to coronavirus-hit countries such as Italy and South Korea.\\n\\nOil prices took a dive as the global futures market broke below $50 per barrel, a closely watched number that signals whether oil companies and oil-producing countries can make profits. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil gauge, was selling below $45 per barrel. Brent Crude prices were just under $50. The energy sector was down 20 percent on the week and nearly 25 percent on the year. Energy is the main killer, said Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones indexes. It's devastating.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOil suppliers are hoping for a boost in demand from possible supply cuts at a March 5-6 meeting by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies like Russia, a group known as OPEC+.\\n\\nExperts said the panic caused by the coronavirus needs to play itself out. There are many unknowns, they said.\\n\\nThe lights went out on the stock market in February, said Chris Rupkey of MUFG Bank. Wall Street can panic, but until Main Street panics, we are not going to get a recession. If the broader economy doesn't take a hit, companies don't lay off people and consumers don't stop buying homes and cars, then this sell-off is too far ahead of itself.\\n\\nThe outbreak has upended daily routines and business operations around the world. Next week's Geneva Motor Show, a major event for the world's struggling auto industry, was canceled as Swiss officials said gatherings of more than 1,000 people had been banned through mid-March. The Port of Baltimore reduced its hours of operation after port officials said the coronavirus posed significant and unprecedented disruptions to the global supply chain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the virus spreads quite a bit, the market will work through a bad quarter or two of bad economic activity, said Scott Wren of Wells Fargo Investment Institute. It's all about whether people are going to be out there spending or if they are going to be home hiding.\\n\\nThis week's swift Wall Street sell-off erased one-third of stocks' gains since President Trump's 2016 election. And while public health officials scramble to contain what appears to be inevitable spread in the United States, the government finds itself battling an economic emergency that could threaten the nation's record economic expansion.\\n\\nJared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the stock market's decline was not a concern for a big chunk of the population.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSuch a sharp market correction is, of course, a big deal, Bernstein said. For the half of households who don't own stocks, what matters much more is the economic impact of the virus on their jobs and incomes. There are millions of workers who don't get paid if they can't go to work."}
{"original": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is not waiting to leave office to write his own version of history, and he is not doing it in eloquent books. Instead, he has taken to the favorite medium of our debased age — Twitter — to polish his battered reputation and preen for the possible pursuit of the presidency. His efforts might be said to echo Churchill's — if Churchill were utterly devoid of literary style, honesty, courage, wit, or principle. In truth, Pompeo has taken his inspiration from Churchill's contemporary, George Orwell, who observed: In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.\\n\\nPompeo's Twitter thread — now dozens of entries long — began on Jan. 1 with the kind of baldfaced lie you would have expected from Big Brother: We're so much safer today than four years ago. Come again? 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history. More than 354,000 Americans have already died of covid-19 — and many of those deaths are directly attributable to the epic mismanagement of the president Pompeo has served with canine servility.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLie No. 2: Realism. Restraint. Respect for our founding. These are the core ideas that define America First. America First is the slogan of a president who is now attempting to overturn the presidential election results. Pompeo's master shows his respect for our founding in the same way that Mussolini showed respect for Italian democracy.\\n\\nLie No. 3: Swagger (def.): To represent America with pride, humility, and professionalism. We've done it. Um, no, that's not what swagger means. The dictionary defines it as arrogant or conceitedly self-assured behavior — a far more accurate summary of Pompeo's conduct.\\n\\nThere is not enough space in this newspaper to chronicle all of Pompeo's falsehoods. But a few stand out.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPompeo: We restored America's credibility. The Pew Research Center would beg to differ. It finds that since President Trump and Pompeo took office, favorable views of the United States have plummeted to all-time lows among key allies such as Germany, France and Japan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPompeo: No more leading from behind. We are #LeadingFromTheFront, tackling the world's toughest problems. Given that the administration exited the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, it's fair to say it's not leading from behind in the fight against global warming and covid-19. It's not leading, period.\\n\\nPompeo: We didn't side with dictators, like the last Administration. What a howler. In truth, the administration has based its Middle East policy largely on siding with dictators in Turkey, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Even after Saudi Arabia's crown prince ordered the murder of a Post contributing columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, Trump and Pompeo pushed ahead with a $500 million arms sale to Saudi Arabia. If this isn't appeasement— Pompeo's favorite pejorative for the Obama administration — then the word has no meaning.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou have to give Pompeo credit for chutzpah when he claims the administration pushed back hard on Russian aggression by supporting friends, not coddling Moscow. Trump still hasn't said a word about Russia's reported bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan or its reported cyberattacks on America.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPompeo boasts of support for Ukraine: I issued the Crimea Declaration, which reversed the ban on lethal military assistance to Ukraine. Obama wouldn't send freedom fighters weapons. We did. No mention that Trump held up aid to Ukraine to force its government to smear his political opponent. Pompeo was on the call with Ukraine's president but did not object.\\n\\nPompeo loves to claim credit for actions, even if they achieve no positive results. Afghanistan: Every Administration since Bush 43 wanted to draw down U.S. troops and forge peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. We did it. North Korea: Two summits in Singapore and Hanoi and an historic meeting in the DMZ later, the wins are undeniable. Venezuela: The @StateDept team worked tirelessly to build a global coalition of more than 60 countries taking a stand against the illegitimate Maduro regime.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou would never know that negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban have made little appreciable progress or that the Taliban's terrorist campaign is worse than ever. Or that North Korea now has more nuclear materials or missiles — along with the capability to strike the U.S. mainland with them — than when Trump and Pompeo took office. Or that the Maduro regime remains entrenched in Venezuela. I'd bet that Pompeo will soon claim credit for exiting the Iranian nuclear deal and killing Iranian general Qasem Soleimani without noting that Iran has ramped up uranium production and hasn't curbed its destabilizing activities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut that's not to say that Pinocchio Pompeo's Twitter stream is entirely mendacious. He can rightly claim at least one historic achievement: I was the first Secretary of State to visit Guyana and Suriname.\\n\\nRead more:"}
{"original": "The Iowa caucuses remain 13 months away, but a pent-up demand for change in the White House is tangible among Democrats eager for the 2020 campaign to start in earnest. The throngs of voters bombarding events in Iowa are testament to something fearful for Republicans: The huge tide of Democratic voters who powered the party's 2018 gains have not lost interest as attention turns to the 2020 presidential race.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI've never been to a rally, but I wanted to for a long time, said Dan Elliott, as he waited in the ornate Orpheum Theatre lobby in Sioux City for Warren to speak Saturday morning. I'm surprised by the energy here. The lines are longer than people expected.\\n\\nIowans cited a slew of reasons for their eagerness to begin the lengthy nomination process to settle on a leader to go up against President Trump. There were the tax cuts that one voter called a waste of time and money; the trade war with China depressing demand for exports and hurting farmers; the hostility toward immigrants, a labor pool heavily used on Iowa farms; the rolling back of environmental regulations that impact Iowa's rivers; a foreign policy approach changing the country's status in the world; and the general chaos and lack of civility in the White House.\\n\\nIt is never too soon to try to get rid of Donald Trump, said Shannon Kennedy, a 48-year-old Iowan who stood in line to take a selfie in front of a barn-door-size American flag at the Orpheum Theatre. There is an urgency to get things back on track. Our country is a laughingstock right now.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's not just Warren drawing interest in what amounts to the widest-open caucus competition since 2004.\\n\\nBooker was greeted by enthusiastic crowds when he made his first trip to Iowa in early October for the Democratic Party gala. His visit included standing-room-only turnout at an event advertised as a discussion on agricultural issues and hosted in the Boone County Democratic offices.\\n\\nAs Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) gave a speech in Ankeny during her pre-election Iowa tour, she was greeted by a shout: Run for president! When she spoke in Iowa City and Des Moines, she filled rooms holding about 500 people.\\n\\nThey're paying attention because they don't think this guy can be reelected, said Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has already visited all 99 counties in his presidential bid. And the takeaway I hear from a lot of Democrats is that 2016 wasn't a good primary. It was about people going into their camps early. This year, it's the opposite; Democrats are focused on how we beat this guy in 2020, and they come into the primary process with an open mind.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHelping to channel some of this Democratic enthusiasm are organizations like Siouxland Progressive Women, one of thousands of groups that have cropped up on the left since the 2016 election.\\n\\nWe're so ready, said Susan Leonard, 64, a co-founder of the group. Her 200-member organization campaigned for J.D. Scholten, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa). Now they're turning to 2020.\\n\\nWe've got invitations out to several presidential candidates already, Leonard said. It's a big group, and we want to hear their ideas.\\n\\nThere are plenty of candidates and potential candidates coming to Iowa to meet with Democratic activists. A day after Warren departs Sunday, Julián Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary and San Antonio mayor, is planning stops in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City. Delaney, who was the first Democrat in the race, will open campaign offices here when he returns to Iowa for events Friday and Saturday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTom Steyer, the billionaire who has been campaigning to impeach Trump as he ponders his own presidential bid, is returning soon for an event about education reform. He said in an interview that Trump's actions in the past few weeks had added to what was already highly charged enthusiasm. He specified the government shutdown and the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\\n\\nWe added 5,000 people to our list this morning; we added 10,000 people to our list yesterday, Steyer said. Just look at the turnout on November 6: It broke records, and we think the people on our list turned out something between 75 and 80 percent. And subsequent to that, they literally can't get [an agreement] to keep the government open, and the most respected member of his Cabinet resigned!\\n\\nProgress Iowa drew about 150 people to its 2014 meeting that featured Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Last month's attendance doubled even though the roster included lesser-known potential candidates such as Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.), Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe've seen massive jumps, said Matt Sinovic, the group's executive director. Online donations are also up, he said.\\n\\nThis jolt of Iowa energy for Democrats began in early 2017, as Trump took office and Republicans assumed control of both houses of the legislature and retained the governor's mansion here, he said.\\n\\nNow that we have the chance to take on President Trump directly, now that he's on the ballot, you're going to see that continue to grow, Sinovic said.\\n\\nRepublicans have noticed the enthusiasm.\\n\\nThe Democrats are in a constant hissy about President Trump. It is sustained year around, said David Kochel, a GOP strategist who oversaw Iowa campaigns for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Jeb Bush in 2016. He predicted that Democrats will see a big caucus turn out in 2020.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey've been hungry for this presidential campaign to start in a real way, Kochel said. That's what you'll see with attendance and turnout early this year. They are champing at the bit to get started.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor Warren, a Friday night event in Council Bluffs meant for 300 people drew an extra 200. I'm sorry that there's not enough room to get inside, but I'm glad you're all here, she said. She would repeat that apology Saturday when several dozen couldn't squeeze into a panel discussion at a Storm Lake community center.\\n\\nThe crowds coming out are eager to engage. In Sioux City, when Warren told the audience there that she couldn't do anything about Trump's insults, Glenda Verhoeven, a 63-year-old farmer, shouted, Yes, you can!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVerhoeven, who did not caucus for any Democrat in 2016, said that she considered the senator a strong challenger to Trump because the president seemed obsessed with her.\\n\\nAny time he starts calling people names, they're the people who bother him, Verhoeven said. She already knows the enemy, and he knows her.\\n\\nVerhoeven, whose farm and investments have been hurt by the administration's trade war, said Trump's actions make her more interested in the election."}
{"original": "Roth then noted one other thing she liked about the neighborhood.\\n\\nI got to vote for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she said.\\n\\nAre you in her district? a friend asked. That's really cool.\\n\\nA cautious hope is reemerging in this slice of America, and it has come from the most American of traditions: voting. Residents clamoring for change in the 14th Congressional District last year ousted a 56-year-old white Democrat, one of the most powerful men in Washington, and replaced him with a 29-year-old Latina socialist working as a bartender.\\n\\nBut they didn't stop there. They voted a formerly undocumented immigrant to the state assembly, and they replaced another long-standing politician in the state Senate. The political old guard had been toppled. In its stead were three leftist Latinas with no prior experience in government, who echoed their neighborhood's desire for a radical shift in politics.\\n\\nThough none have much power in the traditional sense, their victories made many residents feel like their lives were newly injected into the American consciousness, along with the rural voters and white conservatives who rejoiced that Donald Trump's ascent had done the same for them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRoth's incoming congresswoman was now sitting with Stephen Colbert and spreading the gospel of the urban working class to audiences across the country. Roth said she liked her liberal lifestyle and felt a little bit like it was expanding. If it wasn't expanding, at least the outer shell was thickening enough to shield the other America.\\n\\nThey say we are living in a bubble, but I like my bubble, said Roth, a 30-year-old graphic artist who grew up outside Detroit. There are two different realities going on in America, and a part of the country is living in a way that's unfathomable to me.\\n\\nAlejandro Osorio, the 39-year-old owner of Arepa Lady, encountered that other America only through the filter of social media clips his friends posted from Fox News and other conservative sites. Pundits called Ocasio-Cortez a hypocrite when the avowed socialist wore expensive clothes, derided her after she flubbed distinguishing the three branches of government, mocked her meager savings account and, last month, questioned her fortitude after she said she needed a week-long break for self-care.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor Osorio, the idea of feeling misunderstood extended to his outgoing congressman, Joseph Crowley. Osorio had always heard Crowley was a power player in Washington, but he had no idea what that meant or why that might have been relevant to his life.\\n\\nIn his world, life just kept going on — no matter who the president was or how beloved Crowley was in the nation's capital. In Jackson Heights, Osorio said, residents simply dealt with whatever decisions came down from Washington. Ocasio-Cortez's victory gave him hope that his version of America could become part of the national conversation.\\n\\nBack when Osorio moved here in the late 1980s, his family was like most families — new to the country, not fluent with the language. Since then, those families have learned English and gained citizenship and sent their children to schools where they learned the importance of civic engagement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat new generation no longer wanted to feel like they were on the sidelines of American politics — they wanted to believe that they, too, had an ability to shake things up.\\n\\nThey say looking at your phone is a bad thing, but I'm learning a lot from what the young people in the neighborhood are talking about, Osorio said. That's how I learned Ocasio-Cortez. That's how I learned about intersectional feminism.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez, who defeated Republican Anthony Pappas in November's general election, spoke about the minimum wage and assuring health care and the difficulties of working strange hours for service jobs — which all made sense to Osorio. She sounded like she was from the real New York, not the one you see on TV where it's just white people, Osorio said. She created a buzz around here, just because it felt like she knew our story.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGus Santana, a 31-year-old son of immigrants from the Dominican Republic, didn't imagine his concerns as a Latino working-class person were much different from a white working-class person: He was concerned about going broke if he got sick, feeling safe in his neighborhood, his parents not losing their Social Security checks.\\n\\nYet he never felt that his experience, or those around him, were the image of the working, everyday American. Ocasio-Cortez could change that thinking, he hoped.\\n\\nThe best thing she'll be able to teach people is that the voice of the inner city matters, Santana said.\\n\\nSantana recently graduated from a local college and was working at a relative's appliance store while he waited to hear back from the human resource companies where he wanted to work.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy parents already made their American Dream come true — coming here, having a family and being able to provide for them, Santana said. I guess my American Dream is different because I grew up here. When you grow up in this country, you are told to have the picket fence and the front yard and a backyard.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, the polarization in this country had lessened his desire to achieve the American Dream that he had once learned about.\\n\\nOutside his bubble, Santana wondered why so many around him were gripped by fear. Why be fearful of losing a way of life, he wondered. Most around him were foreign-born and had already lost their way of life. Why be fearful about having to leave a job and learning a new skill? Many of his friends' parents were professionals in other countries and opted to slug it out in America instead.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSantana hoped Ocasio-Cortez, her voice and her popularity, might usher in a broader thinking about the American ideal. He didn't want to have to leave city life to feel like he was in a prized part of the country.\\n\\nIt does suck, though, that you would have go out of New York to get that kind of American Dream, he said. Like you have to move to North Carolina or something. I know that's what I'm supposed to want, but living in a place like that seems kind of corny to me. Bland.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe heart of the neighborhood's multicultural ethos is Diversity Plaza, an outdoor festival space braced by a host of mostly South Asian restaurants and shops. One recent weekend on the lower level of a Pakistani restaurant there, a majority-white group of residents gathered in a computer repair shop. They met to figure out what they could do to thwart what they felt was the most immediate threat to pierce their bubble: the crackdown on illegal immigration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe're happy to host you, Agha Saleh, the owner of the computer repair shop, told members of the Jackson Heights Immigrant Solidarity Network.\\n\\nThe group talked about handing out fliers to discuss some of the recent tactics immigration officials were using to identify undocumented migrants in the neighborhood. They figured they would need to print fact sheets in Spanish, Bangla, Urdu, Nepalese, Punjuabi and more.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe've got our own issues, people are worried about the gentrification and all that; but everything crystallizes the immigration issue, said David Stock, 67.\\n\\nThen, they discussed attending an immigration forum in the new year, and a member of the group started to run down the list of guests. They included Jessica Ramos, their new state senator. And Catalina Cruz, the formerly undocumented immigrant whom they elected to the state assembly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, if she can make it, she said.\\n\\nThe group smiled and nodded. Crowley had pushed legislation mandating that immigrations and customs officers file a report every time they stop someone, rather than every time they make an arrest. Ocasio-Cortez's push to abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency altogether seemed more resonant and radical.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe just gives us a little more hope, Stock said after the meeting.\\n\\nNot too much hope because after the 2016 election, I'm not sure I understand the country anymore, said one woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she didn't want to endanger her husband's green card renewal. You never know with politics.\\n\\nAt least she'll fight, another participant said.\\n\\nSaleh walked outside his restaurant to puff a cigarette. Around him were a man with a cart working 12-hour shifts selling shish kebabs and families headed to buy saris from stores in Little India. He looked up at the high-rise under construction, casting a new shadow over his restaurant. Change, he said, is definitely coming here, as the train continued to rumble. Their hope was that Ocasio-Cortez would help lead it."}
{"original": "– President Obama, State of the Union address, Jan. 20, 2015\\n\\nTwo years later, plentiful, high-quality affordable child care remains an Obama priority, but it's certainly not a reality.\\n\\nIt's not even a national priority, not really.\\n\\nSo few children receive child-care subsidies … because we fail to recognize that child care is a basic, said Helen Blank, the National Women's Law Center's child care and early learning director.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConsider these facts drawn from a recent Government Accountability Office report: 14.2 million children under age 13 met federal requirements for child-care subsidies in 2011-2012. Of that number, 8.6 million were eligible under state policies. Yet only 1.5 million children actually received the subsidies. That means only 10.6 percent of the number of children meeting federal guidelines actually get the subsidy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe program is administered by the states, and the reasons for low participation rates vary. The child-care subsidy is not an entitlement. Limited funding means the subsidies are not available to all eligible families. Some families that meet federal guidelines do not meet stricter state requirements. Others may not know about the subsidies, may find it difficult to apply for them, or may be wait listed because their state cannot afford to subsidize all eligible applicants, the GAO said.\\n\\nFunding too low, requirements too high — this sounds like another bureaucratic exercise, but it is a serious problem for many families, a problem that undermines the American economy. Obama recognized this and promoted a plan including a landmark investment in the Child Care and Development Fund that provides the subsidy funding to the states. Congress did not act on his proposals. President-elect Donald Trump's child-care initiatives include tax credits for child-care expenses.\\n\\nA video released by the Department of Labor argues that adding women to the U.S. labor force could increase the gross domestic product. (Department of Labor)\\n\\nWhile proposals work their way through the long political process, families suffer because child care still isn't the priority it needs to be. Hear the parents:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJackie L. Roberson Jr., a single father with full custody of his son in Buffalo: I had to take out loans and take from my savings, retirement, to pay for child care. I had to borrow from my family to pay for child care and cut back on certain things in my life to make sure Elijah had proper child care. Simple things — like cutting back on driving to spend less on gas. It's a budgeting act. Because I haven't had access to [a] subsidy, I'm still in debt from my years of having to pay for day care, and still having to pay for day-care expenses.\\n\\nMary Lupien, a mother of two in Rochester, N.Y.: It (the subsidy when she had it) made a huge difference … I was working full time and paying $900 a month in child care. Between health insurance and child care, I was spending over half of my paycheck … I could not have survived without the subsidy. With the subsidy, Lupien said she paid $39.50 weekly, about $155 a month, for the same service.\\n\\nSandra Harris, a New York mother of three expecting twins, was eligible for the subsidy until last year: It was impossible for me (to afford child care) being paid at a minimum-wage job. The cost of child care would have left me not able to pay for rent or any other bills.\\n\\nT'challa Jenerson, a mother of two in Rochester, was denied assistance because of lack of funding: The cost of child care is ridiculous, and for a low-income family that means making major sacrifices in order to get things done.\\n\\nThese are not sob stories. They are examples of lower American productivity because of inadequate child-care funding. Access to high-quality care for young children can help parents increase their employment and earnings, a White House report on The Economics of Early Childhood Investments said in 2015. Parents who have child care options are better able to work, and to work more hours.\\n\\nYet child-care subsidies are severely underfunded, said Hannah Matthews, director of child care and early education for the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP). More federal and state investment is sorely needed to expand access to subsidies to reverse the declining numbers of children served.\\n\\nJenerson knows about underfunding on a personal and family level, where child care has always been a major expense and struggle in my household.\\n\\nLiving paycheck to paycheck is already hard enough, and every paycheck a decision has to be made of what necessity we can do without until the next check, she said. I am at a point where it feels like I am merely existing and not really living.\\n\\nRead more:"}

{"original": "I share the concerns of many voters across the country about irregularities in the presidential election. I also share their disappointment with President Trump's loss. However, the Founders trusted the states to decide elections, not members of Congress.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Republican members who plan to reject certain electors read into the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act a provision that simply does not exist. The 12th Amendment is simple and clear: It calls on Congress to perform the ceremonial role of counting electors. There is no allowance for rejecting electors — no matter how much we may disagree with the result or wish the election process had been better.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe electoral college has come under attack in recent years. The left characterizes the system as an antiquated, undemocratic method of selecting the president. In reality, our nation's Founders designed this system as a compromise that takes into account a variety of competing concerns. The electoral college balanced a desire to allow individuals across the nation to vote for president while also ensuring that small states' voters would not be ignored.\\n\\nThe system is complex and often requires explanation. On Capitol Hill, it is usually my Democratic colleagues who need reminders of the electoral college's vital role in preserving our system of federalism. This week, however, it is Republican members of Congress who require a refresher course about why the electoral college must be preserved — and why we should avoid the temptation of using this system in a misguided effort to jettison a presidential election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor decades, progressives have tried to abolish the electoral college in favor of a direct democracy approach; under their plan, votes would be cast in a national election, bypassing electors and the states. They have pushed populist initiatives, most notably the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, to do away with the electoral college without even having to go through the inconvenience of a constitutional amendment. This interstate compact directs participating states to cast their electoral votes for the presidential candidate with the highest number of votes nationwide — regardless of the choice of the voters in their own states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe current ploy by my Republican colleagues, to challenge the electors in one or more states, threatens the future of the electoral college. It lends credence to opponents' arguments that this system overrides votes and tramples on the will of voters.\\n\\nThe path that led to this episode began with Trump's victory in 2016. Progressives did everything they could to undermine his policy initiatives, and even impeached him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEmotions run high in this partisan environment, and given everything our president has unfairly endured, it is easy to understand why so many of his supporters think the election may have been stolen. But the choice before us now is to accept the results of the November election, or to object and undermine not only the president but also the institutions that define us as a free people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe electoral college is a safeguard on our system of federalism and individual liberty — not an invitation to do an end-run around election results."}
{"original": "Los Angeles County has been so overwhelmed it is running out of oxygen, with ambulance crews instructed to use oxygen only for their worst-case patients. Crews were told not to bring patients to the hospital if they have little hope of survival and to treat and declare such patients dead on the scene to preserve hospital capacity. Several Los Angeles hospitals have turned away ambulance traffic in recent days because they can't provide the airflow needed to treat patients.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nArizona now has the nation's highest rate of coronavirus hospitalizations. In the Atlanta area, nearly every major hospital is almost full, prompting state officials to reopen a field hospital for the third time.\\n\\nThe optimism that came with new vaccines and a new year is colliding with a grim reality: The United States has reached the worst stage of the pandemic to date, with the deadly results of holiday gatherings yet to arrive. Vaccine distribution is also off to a slow start, with at least 4.6 million inoculated, far short of the 20 million the Trump administration vowed to vaccinate by the end of 2020.\\n\\nWe have so many crises happening simultaneously on multiple fronts, said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist with George Mason University. And all signs point to things getting a whole lot worse before they get better.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe back-to-back timing of Christmas and New Year's Eve could have catastrophic results because many people develop symptoms roughly five to seven days after infection and are most contagious during the 48 hours before those symptoms appear. That means someone who was exposed to the virus on Christmas could have been contagious by the time they attended a New Year's party or began traveling home.\\n\\nJust how bad the situation gets in the United States may depend on how widely the virus's new variant — which scientists believe is more contagious, but not deadlier or vaccine-resistant — is circulating. The variant has been reported in five states including Georgia, which reported its first case of the variant Tuesday. Officials in California said that 32 cases of the variant have been detected in San Diego County.\\n\\nWith estimates that the new variant could be 10 to 70 percent more transmissible, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement last week that it could lead to more cases and place greater demand on already strained health care resources.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNew daily deaths and cases have increased by more than 20 percent over the past week, to a total of more than 355,000 fatalities and 21 million infections. But experts say the toll on hospitals paints a clearer picture of the pandemic because of complications in reporting test results during the holidays.\\n\\nStates with the largest shares of their populations hospitalized are largely concentrated in the South and West: Arizona, Nevada, Alabama, California, Georgia, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Texas and Delaware.\\n\\nAt St. Mary Medical Center in Apple Valley, the ICU is full, the main lobby has become a makeshift covid ward, and patients spill out into the parking lot. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe situation in California has grown especially dire in recent days. On Tuesday, the state hit a new single-day record for hospitalizations, with 22,405 covid-19 patients, more than 4,700 of whom were in intensive care units. And as cases continue to soar, the ability of hospitals and EMTs to save the sick will keep degrading.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHospital officials in Southern California said they were running low not just on ICU beds but also on ventilators and morgue space. But perhaps the direst shortage is of oxygen. Because covid-19 is a respiratory disease that attacks the lungs, most hospitalized patients require oxygen. The sheer number of patients has placed such a strain on oxygen systems that some hospitals are struggling to provide adequate air pressure and flow into patients' lungs. There are also shortages of portable oxygen tanks in ambulances as well as ones that are sent home with patients, making it difficult to discharge some patients even as hospitals run out of capacity.\\n\\nIn a directive Monday, the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services Agency told EMTs to conserve oxygen by giving it only to patients with oxygen saturation levels below 90 percent. To ease the backup at hospitals, county officials also issued a plan to set up tents just outside to create temporary ambulance receiving spaces. Officials hope that makeshift system will free up ambulances now sitting idle outside hospitals because their patients can't be admitted.\\n\\nWe're no longer a wave or surge, or surge upon a surge. We really are in the middle of a viral tsunami, said Robert Kim-Farley, a medical epidemiologist at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced a statewide plan and a team of officials focused on bolstering California's oxygen supply. The Army Corps of Engineers has also been called in and is sending crews to update oxygen-delivery infrastructure at several aging hospitals — five in downtown Los Angeles and two in San Bernardino. Separately, state emergency teams have been deployed to refill oxygen tanks at 42 medical support units across the state. The state is also leasing mobile oxygen systems to bolster supplies and looking to order several hundred oxygen concentrator units. The overarching goal, Newsom said, is to reduce the stress placed on hospitals' existing oxygen systems so they can maintain adequate air pressure for patients.\\n\\nExpanding the oxygen supply doesn't end the challenges for hospitals, Kim-Farley said.\\n\\nWhen you get to that level of volume being pumped through, some of the pipes start to freeze up. You start running out of oxygen tanks that patients need to be sent home and discharged, Kim-Farley said. As the cases keep increasing, you're going to see those kinds of effects start to pile up. ICU beds get full. The ER gets backed up. Ambulances have nowhere to take patients. You get severe, chronic staffing shortages. Elective surgeries get canceled again. The ability to care simply degrades.\\n\\n'The entire country is essentially in uncontrolled spread'\\n\\nArizona, once heralded for turning the corner after a summer surge, now has 69 of every 100,000 residents hospitalized with the virus — the highest rate in the country. Hospital leaders say they saw this coming a month ago, but they allege that Gov. Doug Ducey (R) ignored their pleas to reimpose measures to curb the spread. State officials have said enacting restrictions would do little to curb transmission at private gatherings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe day after Thanksgiving, a team of researchers issued a dire warning in a memo to the Arizona Department of Health Services. Failure to issue a shelter-in-place order to stave off a crisis in hospitals risks a catastrophe on a scale of the worst natural disaster the state has ever experienced. It would be akin to facing a major forest fire without evacuation orders, the memo said.\\n\\nDucey instead loosened restrictions on outdoor dining several days later. He prohibited gatherings of over 50 people — double the threshold sought by medical groups — but declined to take other measures they urged, such as a statewide mask mandate and a ban on indoor dining.\\n\\nHospital leaders, front-line workers and experts condemned Ducey for refraining from imposing sweeping mitigation measures. After Arizona became the epicenter of an early summer crisis, Ducey, who opposed shutdowns and mask mandates, reversed himself by allowing localities to impose mandatory masking and temporarily closed bars, gyms and theaters. With some mask mandates lifted and businesses reopened, Ducey's recent approach has been to urge voluntary compliance, such as by asking residents to celebrate Christmas safely outdoors and with masks on.\\n\\nOur state is doing very little to slow transmission of the virus. We have a very lax policy environment. Our businesses are open, said Joe Gerald, a University of Arizona researcher who has been tracking the spread of the virus and was among those urging a shelter-in-place order. The virus is just basically transmitting almost uninhibited through our population.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe hospital crisis the researchers had warned of came true. Hospitalizations climbed past their summer peak in mid-December and have been steadily rising since then. Just 7 percent of the state's ICU beds have been available since the new year started. The seven-day average of new cases has surpassed 8,000, up from 5,700 on New Year's Eve.\\n\\nAt Banner Health System — the state's largest hospital network — several facilities are now over 125 percent of their licensed occupancy, and elective surgeries have been suspended since Jan. 1.\\n\\nTo expand the workforce, the health system is recruiting 2,000 contractors such as travel nurses and respiratory therapists. Central office employees with medical licenses have been deployed to the front lines, and those who cannot practice medicine are answering phones, transporting supplies and performing other basic tasks. Banner staff working in Colorado, where cases are declining, have been shifted to Arizona.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut unlike during the summer surge, Arizona has much stiffer competition now for health-care workers.\\n\\nRight now the entire country is essentially in uncontrolled spread, so every single state is looking for those same limited resources, said Marjorie Bessel, chief clinical officer at Banner Health. It's a sad situation to not have had more mitigation be undertaken when all the science showed us exactly what's happening is exactly what we predicted.\\n\\nPressed on the rising cases and hospitalizations, Ducey said last month that the government had little ability to curb the spread of the virus at private gatherings. He rejected calls from the state superintendent of schools to keep schools virtual for two weeks as a holiday quarantine period.\\n\\nA spokesman for Ducey did not return emails seeking comment. Cara Christ, Arizona's top public health official, said aggressive shutdown measures would not have staved off a spike driven by family gatherings and an influx of winter visitors seeking warm weather.\\n\\nIf you look at California, they have some of the strictest restrictions in the country and are still seeing elevated cases, Christ said in an interview. It's not that we loosened the restrictions from this summer when we successfully brought the rates down significantly. What we are finding is people, when they are with people they love and trust, are letting their guard down.\\n\\nCleavon Gilman, an emergency room doctor in Yuma, Ariz., said he's seen an uptick in patients arriving short of breath and with low oxygen levels since New Year's. They include grandmothers infected during family gatherings, Mexican immigrants who rode packed buses to agricultural jobs, and people in their 20s and 30s. Many patients, he says, are coming in after their lungs have been irreparably damaged, and he is bracing for more of them to die.\\n\\nIt's very demoralizing sometimes to work here and to know the science and for it to be ignored, said Gilman, who drew national attention and a call from President-elect Joe Biden for bringing attention to the state's lack of hospital beds. A lot of people are going to die because of failed leadership.\\n\\n'I'm trying to hold on to the hope that the vaccines represent'\\n\\nNearly every major hospital in the metropolitan Atlanta area is now full, prompting state officials to reopen a field hospital at the World Congress Center, one of the nation's largest convention centers. Northeast Georgia Health System says its four hospitals are running out of ways to expand capacity after setting up cots in gyms, creating temporary spaces in hallways and, in some cases, treating patients while they are still inside an ambulance.\\n\\nWe are holding our breath and waiting to see what the next two or three weeks might bring post-holiday, and hopefully we don't see a massive spike, said Sean Couch, a spokesman for the system.\\n\\nEight of the 10 U.S. counties reporting the largest per capita increases in their caseloads are small, rural Georgia counties.\\n\\nIn other states, the worst-case scenarios did not materialize. Hospitals in New Mexico did not need to ration care as authorized a month ago by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D). States in the Upper Midwest and the Dakotas, which experienced some of the worst spikes in cases and hospitalizations before Thanksgiving, are starting to see cases level off.\\n\\nPublic health experts say the country faces a challenge similar to the one last spring: buying time. In the early months of the pandemic, authorities urged the public to flatten the curve by following stay-at-home orders to give hospitals time to expand their capacity and protect their staffs. Now, they are pleading with Americans to keep following basic precautions — wearing masks, socially distancing, avoiding crowds — with the promise of a vaccine on the horizon."}

(I researched this in early 2016 while public editor of the New York Times; in a fairly typical two-week period, three out of every four pieces of political journalism were horse race coverage.)\\n\\nYou can see it happening again, already. News organizations were agog at Elizabeth Warren's video in which she began to lay out her substantial ideas but then awkwardly declared a brief pause — I'm gonna get me a beer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCBS News, among many others, found this last part newsworthy, tweeting: Sen. Elizabeth Warren drank a beer on Instagram Live — and it received mixed reactions. Boston Herald columnist Jaclyn Cashman (amusingly) teed off on it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd nearly every news organization published articles on Warren's personality and gender, comparing her to Hillary Clinton. Last Sunday's Times featured an above-the-fold article with the headline, Party tension: Can a Woman Defeat Trump?\\n\\nThen commentators wrote meta-pieces on all this, many readable or funny or enlightening. (Devorah Blachor in McSweeney's was all three in a piece called I Don't Hate Women Candidates — I Just Hated Hillary Clinton and Now I'm Starting to Hate Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut none of that had much to do with acquainting voters with what Warren stands for.\\n\\nThe press critic and New York University professor Jay Rosen may have a better idea: What he calls the citizens agenda.\\n\\nThe gist is that the mission of pre-election coverage should not be to determine who's going to win, but to respond intelligently to what voters want and need to know.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's so simple it seems absurd the reality is so far from it.\\n\\nRosen writes on his PressThink blog that one of the problems with election coverage as it stands is no one has any idea what it means to succeed at it.\\n\\nPredicting the winner? Is that success? Even if journalists could do that (and they can't) it would not be much of a public service, would it? A very weird thing about horse race or 'game' coverage is it doesn't answer to any identifiable need of the voter. Should I vote for the candidate with the best strategy for capturing my vote?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe citizens agenda, which Rosen says was once tried to good effect by the Charlotte Observer partnering with the Poynter Institute, asks different questions: What do you want the candidates to be discussing as they compete for votes?\\n\\nFrom the best answers to that everything else flows.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRosen knows this all sounds dorky and not much fun. (And granted, people may ultimately cast their votes partly because they'd rather have a beer with one candidate over another, which is no doubt part of the reason Warren downed that beer on social media.)\\n\\nFor journalists, it amounts to, he writes, civics class, as against drinks with the county chairman at the Des Moines Marriott.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut given we're in an extreme situation these days — with a president dismissive of democratic norms and commanding the news cycle with a wave of his hand — such ideas take on new urgency.\\n\\nThere may be others. Some may be under consideration or discussion even now. And we do see examples of journalism based on public interest — not just charts comparing stances on issues, but meaningful, engaging explorations of how tax or immigration policy affects real lives and pocketbooks; but they are vastly outweighed by horse race or shiny-object coverage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, the clock is already ticking toward November of next year. Ticking toward what may be the most consequential election in American history, other than the last one — before which news organizations for the most part failed to serve the public interest.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou might recall.\\n\\nObsessed with polls, they still called the election wrong. They helped crown the Democratic Party's favored nominee, Hillary Clinton, literally years before the party convention. They allowed Donald Trump to dominate coverage as he wished. In the name of fairness, they focused on personality flaws and relatively minor mistakes while failing to effectively drive home obvious character disasters.\\n\\nThe prospect of repetition is grim but, from the early signs, all too likely.\\n\\nAnd if that makes embracing the status quo — doing things the same old way but maybe with more staff — a good idea, I can't understand why."}
{"original": "The NBA's 11 scheduled games proceeded as scheduled despite the tense scene earlier in the day at the nation's capital. Members of the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat took a knee during the national anthem at a game in Miami, and the teams issued a joint statement on Blake's shooting and the Capitol protests.\\n\\nWe play tonight's game with a heavy heart after yesterday's decision in Kenosha, and knowing that protesters in our national's capital are treated differently by political leaders depending on what side of certain issues they are on, the statement read. The drastic different between the way protesters this past spring and summer were treated and the encouragement given to today's protesters who acted illegally just shows how much more work we have to do.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe two teams stopped short of sitting out the game, citing a desire to try to bring joy into people's lives and adding that we must not forget the injustices in our society.\\n\\nKenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced Tuesday that Rusten Sheskey, the officer who shot Blake, a Black man, in the back seven times in August, would not be charged after an extensive review. Blake's shooting led the Milwaukee Bucks to refuse to take the court for Game 5 of a first-round series against the Orlando Magic, which in turn prompted a three-day shutdown of the playoffs at the NBA bubble in Disney World and fueled widespread protests across professional sports.\\n\\nThe Bucks, who played host to the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, took the court like usual and claimed the opening tip-off. Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA's back-to-back MVP, claimed possession and then tossed the ball out of bounds as both teams and the Bucks' coaching staff took a knee in protest. The Pistons then took possession and repeated the demonstration, with Blake Griffin tossing the ball out of bounds as both teams took a knee. Milwaukee then took possession and the game resumed.\\n\\nIt's a lot in America, Antetokounmpo said. As Giannis, I stand for change. My team stands for change. Every time we see something that's not right, we're going to speak about it and use our platform the right way. This really bothers me. My kid is going to grow up here in America, and my kid is Black. I can't imagine my kid going through what I've seen on the TV.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAntetokounmpo's comments followed a statement from the Bucks, issued Tuesday, in which the organization said it remains firmly against excessive use of force by law enforcement.\\n\\nThis past year shed light on the ongoing racial injustices facing our African American and other marginalized communities, the statement continued. Reoccurring instances of excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging the Black community must stop. We will continue to work to enact policy change so these incidents no longer exist.\\n\\nGraveley announced that Blake was in possession of a knife at the time of his shooting and that two other police officers who were on the scene at the time of the shooting would not be charged. The decision led to a kneeling protest by the Marquette's men's basketball team Tuesday, and it prompted frustrated reactions from across the NBA.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo hear what happened in Kenosha today was a blow to the heart and to the gut, Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James said. Not only to that community but to us and every Black person that has been a part of this process and seen these outcomes for so long. We've got to continue to stay strong, to continue to believe in each other and to continue to push for change and the greater good.\\n\\nNumerous coaches addressed the temporary occupation of the Capitol building, echoing the theme of disparate treatment given to Black Lives Matter protesters and the pro-Trump group.\\n\\nCan you imagine today if those were all Black people storming the Capitol and what would have happened? Philadelphia 76ers Coach Doc Rivers said. To me, that's a picture that's worth 1,000 words for all of us to see and probably something for us to reckon with again. No police dogs turned on people, no billy clubs hitting people. People peacefully being escorted out of the Capitol.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAtlanta Hawks Coach Lloyd Pierce said that it was no coincidence that the Capitol building siege took place one day after Raphael Warnock won a runoff election and became the first Black senator from Georgia.\\n\\nWe live in a divided country, Pierce said. We could say it's power and politics, but it's race as well. Racism is real. The issues are real. The protests are real. What we're seeing now is a sad reality that our country has yet to reckon with and acknowledge. For those who didn't believe it, I hope you believe it now.\\n\\nThe Washington Wizards were not in Washington at the time of the protests, and they took the court in Philadelphia against the 76ers.

{"original": "Why are there so many new Republican women in the House? Because the GOP made it a prime concern. Their numbers could change Republican priorities and perspectives in the new Congress.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow did more Republican women win in 2020?\\n\\nDemocrats have typically elected more women than have Republicans. Because women generally hesitate to run for office more than men do, Democrats and allied political organizations such as Emily's List have worked to recruit and raise money for more female candidates. Republicans have tended to reject identity politics, making it harder to sell donors on the need to elect more women. In fact, while most Democratic donors are familiar with Emily's List, Republican donors generally do not know the various groups working to elect Republican women; these groups raise far less money than does Emily's List.\\n\\nWomen who donate to Democratic candidates are particularly eager to elect women, whereas women who donate to Republicans typically care about candidates' conservatism more than their gender. Furthermore, Republican women who aren't incumbents but have previous experience holding office, such as serving as a state lawmaker or city council member, generally had more difficulty raising money than similarly situated Republican men.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in 2020, House Republicans worked harder to recruit and fund female candidates. Rep. Susan Brooks (Ind.), this year's National Republican Congressional Committee's recruitment chair, made identifying and supporting female candidates a priority. After few Republican women were elected in 2018, Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) launched a leadership PAC that focused media and party attention on the need to recruit more women. Her PAC worked with other organizations, particularly Winning for Women and VIEW PAC, in identifying and funding female candidates.\\n\\nWhile female Republican House members had previously worked together to push for the election of more women, in 2020, the top male Republican leaders joined in promoting female candidates and opening their fundraising networks to them.\\n\\nHow will these GOP women shape policy?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMembers bring their life experiences to the policymaking table. Increased numbers of women in the Republican caucus means more voices articulating experiences as mothers, daughters, individual workers and employers trying to navigate a challenging economy or manage caregiving responsibilities. The newly elected Republican women bring more diversity to a historically White male GOP conference, including two Korean Americans, two Latinas and one Native American. Given these backgrounds, they may emphasize different issues and propose alternative policy prescriptions.\\n\\nAt the same time, these women ran as Republican partisans and are entering an increasingly polarized Congress. Since each house of Congress is controlled by narrow margins, Republicans will probably want to differentiate themselves from Democratic President-elect Joe Biden and a narrow House Democratic majority, not to cooperate with them. This will reduce opportunities for legislating.\\n\\nThree groups of GOP women to watch\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe party will be eager to use these women to advertise Republican policies and encourage suburban women who have drifted away to return to the party. Some of the more moderate women who flipped Democratic seats include Young Kim (R-Calif.) and Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), the latter of whom describes herself as a minivan-driving mom. They may look for common ground with Democrats, hoping for opportunities for bipartisan work to demonstrate their effectiveness to their districts.

But with no safety data available for pregnant women, Rivas thinks she would have chosen to wait even if she were far earlier in her pregnancy. Just to stay safe, she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe same conundrum faces millions of women across the country, among them many health-care workers like Rivas who are being offered vaccines not yet tested on pregnant or lactating women.\\n\\nOne of the first coronavirus hot spots was Albany, Ga., a majority-Black city that has struggled for decades against social and economic inequities. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's a lot of confusion, said Jane Frederick, a fertility specialist in Newport Beach, Calif. I have questions from people who are pregnant and questions from people anticipating getting pregnant: 'Doctor, what do I do?' \\n\\nWith the exception of the smallpox vaccine, which can cause a rare but serious infection of the fetus, vaccines have been safe and enormously beneficial for pregnant women and their babies. Experts say the safety of the new mRNA vaccines, which do not contain live virus, would probably be similar in pregnant and nonpregnant people. What's more, pregnant women face the potential of severe illness from covid-19, which may also increase the risk of preterm birth and other serious outcomes for both mother and infant. Experts also warn against lumping the two distinct biological phases of pregnancy and lactation together.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that people who are pregnant and part of a group recommended to receive the coronavirus vaccine, such as health-care personnel, may choose to be vaccinated. The CDC also says that mRNA vaccines are not thought to be a risk to the breastfeeding infant.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists similarly says that [coronavirus] vaccines should not be withheld from pregnant individuals who meet criteria for vaccination. It also recommends the vaccines be offered to lactating women. But ACOG adds that because of the lack of data, the potential risks to a pregnant individual and the fetus are unknown.\\n\\nAll of which leaves the process of weighing the pros and cons up to the individual in consultation with her doctor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe medical community has done a good job of saying, 'We don't know,'  said Daryl Stoner, an obstetrician with Einstein Physicians Women's Associates for HealthCare outside Philadelphia. That drives people crazy. They want to be told it's safe.\\n\\nDoubts erupted in online pregnancy forums such as What to Expect, with views ranging from women saying they would not risk putting my baby in danger and counseling others to wait for more data or wait out the pandemic, to health-care workers declaring they were absolutely getting it. In some Facebook groups, where anti-vaccine advocates have fanned false worries about many vaccines, the fears are heightened. Many linked to Britain's policy, advising against immunizing pregnant women until more is known about mRNA vaccines.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe differing messages concern many American vaccine experts like Ruth Karron, director of the Center for Immunization Research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who praised the way U.S. regulatory agencies and professional groups have handled the situation, while emphasizing the need for more research.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrom the outset, we and many others were beating the drum for thinking about pregnant women, said Karron, who is a leader of the PREVENT project, which pushes for including pregnant women's interests in the development of vaccines against emerging pathogens such as Zika, Ebola and now covid-19.\\n\\nKarron would have liked to see toxicology studies known as DART studies, which focus on developmental and reproductive risks, completed earlier. The resulting information along with initial safety data from nonpregnant individuals in clinical trials could then have been reviewed by experts to determine how and when the vaccines should be formally evaluated in pregnant women.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs it is, there is a little data from a handful of women who became pregnant during clinical trials. Observational data will also emerge as pregnant women who get vaccinated sign up for V-safe, a CDC app that uses texts and web surveys to check in with coronavirus vaccine recipients.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClinical trials on pregnant women and young children could begin early this year. Stephanie Gaw, an assistant professor in maternal-fetal medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center who has been studying the impact of covid-19 on pregnancy, said her team is planning to launch a study on the vaccine in pregnant and lactating women in the coming weeks.\\n\\nThere has been so much interest from health-care workers, Gaw said.  'Do you want my breast milk? Blood? To evaluate my immune response?' \\n\\nAD\\n\\nMary Prahl, an assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at UCSF who works with Gaw, said she would have liked to see a parallel clinical trial of the vaccines for pregnant women.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPrahl, who is 14 weeks pregnant and plans to get the vaccine soon, said that having studied covid-19 for most of this year, she was relieved to learn a vaccine would be available to her.\\n\\nI don't have any hesitation for myself, said Prahl, while acknowledging that if she were advising a patient, she would run through potential risks and benefits.\\n\\nEveryone brings something different to the table, she said.\\n\\nThe biomedical establishment long excluded pregnant women from research. The National Institutes of Health didn't open an Office of Research on Women's Health until 1990, when manifestation of gynecological symptoms of AIDS helped confirm the need to focus on women.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn clinical trials, a combination of ethical concerns and legal liability continues to handicap progress, according to Ruth Faden, founder of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics and a colleague of Karron's on the PREVENT project.\\n\\nIt's a profound injustice that pregnant women and offspring are late to the table and late to receive benefits, Faden said.\\n\\nThe upshot is that obstetricians have to rely on observational data with many medical treatments, according to David Jaspan, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Einstein Healthcare Network in Pennsylvania, where pregnant women are asked to get a note from their providers before getting the new shots.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe can't comment on the safety of vaccine; we can comment on the impact of covid on pregnancy, Jaspan said, describing a conversation he had recently with a pregnant health-care worker who did not want to be among the first recipients.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSuch shared decision-making is made more complicated by vast variability in the circumstances of pregnant women. A woman working from home is at less risk of exposure to the virus than, say, a food service worker in a hospital or someone whose partner travels on public transportation every day. Some pregnant women suffer from conditions such as obesity or hypertension that increase the chance of complications should they contract covid-19.\\n\\nAnd pregnancy is a dynamic state, not only in terms of fetal development but because it has a beginning and an end: A woman with just a few weeks left before delivery may decide to delay vaccination and instead avoid exposure to the virus until her baby is born.\\n\\nAdd to that the fact that women's childbearing years are limited and some may feel under pressure to get pregnant.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrederick, the fertility specialist, said uncertainty about whether to get the vaccine has added to the anxiety many of her patients already feel.\\n\\nIt's a time-sensitive condition they have, she said. They need to be continuing treatment and not delaying it, hoping the pandemic will go away.\\n\\nFrederick closed her clinic during the early months of the pandemic, advising her patients to delay treatment until more was known about the coronavirus. Now, though, she sees the vaccine as a positive step and in general counsels them that the benefits outweigh any risk.\\n\\nI think it's a good protection, Frederick said.\\n\\nJaspan said providers and their patients should expect knowledge to evolve as well as their own circumstances."}

A war is a contest of wills. The Afghan army and police are demonstrating a will to succeed. — Army Gen. John W. Nicholson Jr., commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, in a press briefing from Kabul\\n\\nOver the course of the war, U.S. military officials have made distinctions in their appraisal of the Afghan security forces. Despite its problems, there is a consensus that the army has made strides and earned a measure of respect from the Afghan public. Elite special-operations units often receive praise for their combat effectiveness.\\n\\nIn the Lessons Learned interviews, U.S. officials aimed much of their criticism at the Afghan police, which function more as a paramilitary force than officers on the beat.\\n\\nIn particular, they heaped scorn on units known as the Afghan Local Police, or ALP. With about 30,000 personnel, the local police are militias organized at the village level. Although they were established in 2010 at the behest of the United States — and trained by the U.S. military — they quickly generated a reputation for brutality and drew complaints from human rights groups.\\n\\nOne unnamed U.S. military official told government interviewers in 2016 that about a third of the local police seemed to be drug addicts or Taliban.

As far as the loss of instructional time to lockdown drills goes, this happens quite regularly and is simply a school-day management issue.\\n\\nHence, as with wars and other catastrophes around our past, present and futures, let us teach school lockdown exercises soberly and objectively and to elicit personal relevance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDan Evans, Reston\\n\\nContentious debate is often stimulated when someone follows discussion on a policy or circumstance by claiming that's not who we are.

{"original": "Regardless of what happens next on tariffs, the ongoing trade war has exposed three things that are unlikely to change anytime soon. Here's what you need to know:\\n\\n1. China's regulatory state is part and parcel of Beijing's globalization strategy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA strict regulatory regime underscores the unique challenge of China's trade advantage. China began to liberalize foreign direct investment (FDI) in the 1990s, even before the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. But almost immediately, as my research shows, the Chinese government systematically re-regulated sector by sector, deliberately employing economic and state interventionist tools to expand the national technology base, promote domestic industry and enhance national security.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNowhere is this more evident than in telecommunications. The introduction of competition in telecom services has modernized China's communications infrastructure — but the Chinese government retains state ownership in basic services and tight control over information dissemination. Beijing does not permit direct market entry of foreign Internet service providers, despite its WTO commitments.\\n\\nAs equipment manufacturers, foreign companies like Ericsson and Nokia were able to invest in China. But the reality of investing in China's telecom sector requires foreign companies to form joint ventures with domestic competitors and transfer their technology to local suppliers. Foreign investors must also manufacture products with domestic contents — and follow China-specific technical standards.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrom the mid-1990s through the late 2000s, the research and development and rollout of TD-SCDMA, China's indigenous 3G telecommunications standard, involved initial technology from German equipment maker Siemens, working closely with state-owned Datang, managed by the Chinese Academy of Telecommunications Technology.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) delayed licensing global 3G technologies, instead waiting on the technical maturity of TD-SCDMA. Then MIIT compelled foreign equipment makers like Motorola and Samsung, and state-owned ZTE and quasi-private Huawei, among others, to invest in products deploying TD-SCDMA for the China market.\\n\\nTo roll out TD-SCDMA, the government restructured the state-owned carriers to maximize nationwide network resources and service operation capabilities. It then assigned TD-SCDMA to the newly strengthened China Mobile. In the mid-2010s, MIIT again delayed licensing the next 4G technologies until after the state-owned carriers successfully rolled out TD-LTE, China's homegrown 4G standard.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2. In 2019, look for 5G wireless standards to complicate the trade war.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis strategic re-regulation of FDI to enhance indigenous innovation and modernize infrastructure is unfolding right now with the development of 5G networks. This next-generation technology is expected to significantly boost data transfer and wireless speeds, and lower lag times between network and device.\\n\\nDespite Beijing's regulatory efforts, TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE are not widely adopted outside of China. This time around, Chinese companies (from Datang to Huawei and ZTE) own in total about 10 percent of 5G-essential intellectual property rights (IPR). The 2017 adoption of Huawei's Polar coding methodology by 3GPP, the global wireless standards-setting body, will likely raise that number as telecom companies around the world, including in Canada and India, deploy Huawei technology for 5G networks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo will China's regulatory state. Made in China 2025, the industrial policy plan Beijing released in 2015, identifies strategic emerging sectors like autonomous vehicles, green technology and semiconductors — and also emphasizes breakthroughs in 5G development.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere's an example of how Chinese regulators and courts exert influence over global markets, with so many multinational corporations doing significant business in China. The State Administration for Market Regulation showed China's tight regulatory fist by delaying the merger between two rival chipmakers: Qualcomm, a U.S. company whose China business accounted for nearly two-thirds of its revenue in 2017, and NXP of the Netherlands. The deal would have increased Qualcomm's competitiveness in the Internet of Things, including connected cars.\\n\\nJust recently, an IPR tribunal of the Fuzhou Intermediate Court banned the sale of older iPhone models after ruling earlier that Apple infringed on Qualcomm patents covering wireless networks and devices. Chinese handset makers like Xiaomi, Vivo and OPPO compete with Apple, and license Qualcomm's 4G and 5G technologies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChina's state-owned telecom operators won't just rely on Qualcomm to maximize China's first-mover advantage in 5G technology. U.S. chipmaker Intel, which operates two assembly and testing factories in Chengdu, has partnered with Huawei and China Mobile to conduct interoperability trials and will work with China Unicom to roll out 5G at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. And there were reports in September that the Chinese government is considering restructuring the national carriers for 5G rollout.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n3. China's regulatory state locks the United States and China into a complex interdependence.\\n\\nWhether China's 5G maneuvers suggest a telecommunications race or an all-out tech war, many analysts expect China to fully commercialize 5G by 2020, five years ahead of Australia, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith chips, networking equipment and smartphones assembled and sold in China, and many related inputs produced there, U.S. high-tech companies, including Qualcomm, Intel, and Apple, are worried about their bottom line as the trade war continues. These companies joined a multi-sector alliance to lobby against the trade war — and argue that trade disputes would slow down the development of 5G in the United States.\\n\\nAccording to the White House, Xi made a promise in Buenos Aires to enforce IPR and approve the Qualcomm/NXP merger. These concessions, however, don't change Beijing's dominant patterns of market governance in strategic sectors. Higher fines for IPR infringement were already in the works, and the merger is conditioned on whether the companies actually revive their deal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe current slowdown notwithstanding, 40 years into China's reform and opening, China's regulatory state matters not least because Chinese regulators and courts increasingly have influence over global value chains, global markets and the direction of technological innovation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet precisely because of the complex interdependence its globalization strategy has created, China can't race ahead without the world in lockstep. China requires global technologies and global markets to propel ahead just as U.S. companies across sectors are eager for the trade dispute to end."}

Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\\n\\nLeonard Leo stepped onto the stage in a darkened Florida ballroom, looked out at a gathering of some of the nation's most powerful conservative activists and told them they were on the cusp of fulfilling a long-sought dream.\\n\\nFor two decades, Leo has been on a mission to turn back the clock to a time before the U.S. Supreme Court routinely expanded the government's authority and endorsed new rights such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Now, as President Trump's unofficial judicial adviser, he told the audience at the closed-door event in February that they had to mobilize in very unprecedented ways to help finish the job.\\n\\nWe're going to have to understand that judicial confirmations these days are more like political campaigns, Leo told the members of the Council for National Policy, according to a recording of the speech obtained by The Washington Post. We're going to have to be smart as a movement.\\n\\nLeo's remarks: 'We stand at the threshold' The Washington Post obtained audio of Leonard Leo speaking to members of the Council for National Policy. Listen (2:03)\\n\\nNo one in this room has probably experienced the kind of transformation that I think we are beginning to see, Leo said.\\n\\nAt a time when Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are rapidly reshaping federal courts by installing conservative judges and Supreme Court justices, few people outside government have more influence over judicial appointments now than Leo.\\n\\nHe is widely known as a confidant to Trump and as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, an influential nonprofit organization for conservative and libertarian lawyers that has close ties to Supreme Court justices. But behind the scenes, Leo is the maestro of a network of interlocking nonprofits working on media campaigns and other initiatives to sway lawmakers by generating public support for conservative judges.\\n\\nThe story of Leo's rise offers an inside look into the modern machinery of political persuasion. It shows how undisclosed interests outside of government are harnessing the nation's nonprofit system to influence judicial appointments that will shape the nation for decades.\\n\\n\\n\\nDocumentary: Pathways to power Conservatives are winning the battle for America's courts, a triumph decades in the making. This is the story of the ideologues, activists and undisclosed donors who made it happen. At the center of the movement is Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, who has helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for nonprofit groups that work behind the scenes to promote conservative judges and causes. Now a private judicial adviser to President Trump, Leo has extraordinary influence over the third branch of government.\\n\\n(Dalton Bennett, Jorge Ribas and Jesse Mesner-Hage)\\n\\nEven as Leo counseled Trump on judicial picks, he and his allies were raising money for nonprofits that under IRS rules do not have to disclose their donors. Between 2014 and 2017 alone, they collected more than $250 million in such donations, sometimes known as dark money, according to a Post analysis of the most recent tax filings available. The money was used in part to support conservative policies and judges, through advertising and through funding for groups whose executives appeared as television pundits.\\n\\nThe groups in Leo's network often work in concert and are linked to Leo and one another by finances, shared board members, phone numbers, addresses, back-office support and other operational details, according to tax filings, incorporation records, other documents and interviews.\\n\\nNine of the groups hired the same conservative media relations firm, Creative Response Concepts, collectively paying it more than $10 million in contracting fees in 2016 and 2017. During that time, the firm coordinated a months-long media campaign in support of Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Neil M. Gorsuch, including publishing opinion essays, contributing 5,000 quotes to news stories, scheduling pundit appearances on television and posting online videos that were viewed 50 million times, according to a report on the firm's website.\\n\\nPresident Trump shakes hands with Judge Neil M.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\\n\\nIn another case, a nonprofit Leo launched in 2016, the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, gave $4 million over two years to a nonprofit called Independent Women's Voice, about half the group's revenue, tax filings show. Leaders of Independent Women's Voice last year spoke at rallies, wrote online commentary and appeared regularly on Fox News to promote another of Trump's Supreme Court nominees, Brett M. Kavanaugh.\\n\\nDuring an on-camera interview for a Post documentary, Leo called himself a leader of the conservative legal movement and said, I have no idea how many groups I've been involved with over the years.\\n\\nA devout Catholic, Leo said he is driven by his faith and a literal interpretation of the Constitution. He also defended the practice of taking money from donors whose identities are not publicly disclosed, comparing his effort to shape the courts to those of abolitionists, suffragists and civil rights activists.\\n\\n[They] were all very much fueled by very wealthy people, and oftentimes wealthy people who chose to be anonymous, Leo said.\\n\\nBut he refused to talk about the money behind his advocacy, saying, I'm not particularly knowledgeable about a lot of it.\\n\\nI have a very simple rule, which is, I'm engaged in the battle of ideas, and I care very deeply about our Constitution and the role of courts in our society, he said. And I don't waste my time on stories that involve money and politics because what I care about is ideas.\\n\\nLater, in response to written questions about the interlocking nonprofits, Leo described the network as an effective and highly successful judicial coalition that's organized just about the same as the Left's, except that their coalition is significantly bigger and better funded.\\n\\nLeo, seen on a video screen, speaks at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington in April. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\\n\\nLeo, 53, wears round, horn-rimmed glasses, tailored suits and monochromatic pocket squares. His office at the Federalist Society is filled with mementos of his career, including a red Trump-campaign-style hat that reads Make The Court Great Again and a gold-framed New Yorker profile of himself. On a bookshelf is a photo of Leo and Kavanaugh in tuxedos. A nameplate on the shelf reads, The Real Boss.\\n\\nLeo grew up in suburban New Jersey, where his high school yearbook lists his nickname as the Moneybags kid and shows a photograph of him holding a handful of cash. He attended Cornell as an undergraduate and law student and founded an early chapter of the Federalist Society, then an all-volunteer organization focused on infusing traditional legal values into the nation's law schools.\\n\\nHis conservative values stood out. When a classmate protesting apartheid in South Africa threw a chocolate cream pie into the face of the university's president, Leo expressed outrage in a letter to the student newspaper. Although some will dismiss Tuesday as only a pie-throwing incident, it is representative of a more hostile form of expression that has become more common, he wrote.\\n\\nIn 1990, Leo became a clerk for a U.S. Court of Appeals judge in Washington, D.C., where he met Clarence Thomas, then an appellate judge. The two became close friends.\\n\\nAfter his clerkship, Leo joined the Federalist Society as one of its first paid employees. But he delayed the start date to help Thomas through his contentious confirmation process for the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAt the Federalist Society, Leo took a leading role in the conservative legal movement, part of a burgeoning effort to counter the influence of the 1960s and liberals on education, law and politics.\\n\\nLeo and Mother Assumpta Long of the Dominican Sisters of Mary Mother of the Eucharist watch President George W. Bush speak at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in 2007. (Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images)\\n\\nWith the election of George W. Bush, Leo began working as an outside adviser for the White House on initiatives related to judicial nominations. Among his allies was Kavanaugh, then White House associate counsel.\\n\\nIn January 2003, Leo called White House officials, including Kavanaugh, to object to a plan by Bush to weigh in on affirmative action. Bush was going to criticize the practice but praise racial diversity. Leo complained that praising diversity would disgust any conservative who thinks that this is a matter of principle, according to a previously unreported email by a White House official describing one of the calls.\\n\\nAbout 15 minutes later, Kavanaugh wrote back: Leonard just called me and gave me the same earful.\\n\\nLeo told The Post that from the accounts of the calls, it appears I was conveying the widely shared belief among conservatives that discriminating on the basis of race is always wrong and inconsistent with the dignity and worth of every person.\\n\\nLeo came to be known in the White House as coordinator of all outside coalition activity regarding judicial nominations, according to a 2003 email by a White House aide to Kavanaugh and others.\\n\\nLeo also developed a reputation as a conservative moneyman. When Kavanaugh and other Bush aides were looking for someone to pay for a press event aimed at supporting the stalled judicial nomination of Miguel Estrada, they turned to Leo.\\n\\nLeonard Leo will know, a White House aide wrote in an email obtained by The Post. We probably don't want the fed soc paying for it, but he might know some generous donor.\\n\\nLeo, center, attends the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in April. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\\n\\nLeo's behind-the-scenes activism came at the same time he was helping to grow the Federalist Society, which describes itself as nonpartisan. Leo told The Post he has taken steps to avoid any conflict.\\n\\nI separate my advocacy from the educational work of The Federalist Society, he said in his statement. I put in a full day's work for the Society and spend a substantial amount of my personal time on the other public service work I also love.\\n\\nLeo told The Post he has employed techniques liberals used to derail the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court three decades ago.\\n\\nIn 2005 and 2006, Leo served as the leader of the campaigns supporting Supreme Court nominees John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr. He and other members of an advocacy coalition spent about $15 million in donations from undisclosed donors on ads, telemarketing and the mobilization of grass roots groups, Leo later told a Federalist Society chapter at the University of Virginia. They conducted polls to help craft the most persuasive messages and arranged dozens of background briefings for reporters.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court justices, from left: Stephen G.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\\n\\nA key part of those efforts was a new nonprofit called the Judicial Confirmation Network, or JCN. Tax filings show it was based at the home of Ann and Neil Corkery, close allies of Leo who have served as board members or treasurers of organizations run by Leo and a small group of interconnected activists.\\n\\n[Read five takeaways from The Post's investigation.]\\n\\nOne radio spot paid for by JCN in Arkansas featured a local minister who warned listeners that liberals wanted to curb religious freedom, including Christmas celebrations. Now these extremist groups want our senators to vote against Judge Alito for the United States Supreme Court, the ad said.\\n\\nIn the interview with The Post, Leo said he took time off from the Federalist Society — a charity that says it does not endorse specific nominees — during the nomination fights in 2005 and 2006. The group's tax filings show that his compensation in those two years jumped by nearly 50 percent, to about $328,000 annually. Leo did not respond to a question about how his compensation was affected by his time off. A spokesman for the Federalist Society said Leo's pay went up — despite the time off — because of the organization's extraordinary revenue growth. Back at the Federalist Society the following year, his compensation was $419,000.\\n\\nDocuments show that Leo never assumed a formal position at JCN, which eventually changed its name to the Judicial Crisis Network. But he told The Post he is very supportive of the group.\\n\\nLeo speaks at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in April. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe ties between JCN and Leo are opaque. JCN's office is on the same hallway as the Federalist Society in a downtown Washington building, though JCN's website and tax filings list a mailing address at a different location, an address shared by multiple companies.\\n\\nJCN board director Gary Marx told The Post the two organizations share similar goals but have different boards, different missions, different functions and do very different things.\\n\\nWhen a Post reporter visited the JCN offices to ask questions, a security guard contacted a longtime employee of the Federalist Society to see whether anyone at JCN was available. A Federalist Society employee then escorted the reporter to JCN's office.\\n\\nThe group's president, Daniel Casey, has worked closely with Leo for years. Casey receives no pay from JCN or three other nonprofits in the network that he helps to lead, tax filings show. He received more than $1.5 million in fees from the Federalist Society over nine years for media training through a firm based at his home in Front Royal, Va.\\n\\nIn an interview with The Post, Casey declined to discuss that firm, DC Strategies. He said all of the nonprofit groups he is affiliated with followed the law. Everything is up and up, he said.\\n\\nLeo told The Post that Casey has been a highly skilled provider of strategic consulting services in the legal policy space for over 30 years.\\n\\nSupreme Court Justices Roberts, left, Thomas, Breyer and Alito attend President George W. Bush's State of the Union address in 2006. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\\n\\nLeo's influence and political connections continued to expand even as President Barack Obama took over the White House.\\n\\nHe routinely attended galas and black-tie Federalist Society events that included justices Thomas, Alito and Antonin Scalia, as well as McConnell and other leading lawmakers, according to interviews and annual reports by the Federalist Society.\\n\\nHe also became more adept at managing media campaigns. In a previously undisclosed email, Leo boasted to a colleague in 2009 about his savvy at generating free publicity through the Federalist Society.\\n\\nI'm very familiar with the media, Leo wrote to Tom Carter, then a spokesman for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a government agency created to promote religious liberty abroad. I spend probably close to $800,000 annually on a PR team at the Federalist Society, and we generate press that has a publicity value of approximately $146 million each year.\\n\\nLeo, then a commissioner, said the Federalist Society had learned to sidestep pointed questions about judicial nominees — and he urged Carter to do the same in his work for the commission. We get around these inquiries quite well, and I am sure you can find a way to do so as well, he wrote.\\n\\nLeo joined additional advocacy groups that expanded his influence following the Supreme Court's landmark Citizens United decision in 2010, which lifted restrictions on spending by corporations, unions and nonprofits on politically oriented advertisements and media campaigns.\\n\\nLeo on anonymous funding Leonard Leo helped conservative nonprofits raise more than $250 million from mostly undisclosed donors in recent years to promote conservative judges and causes. Watch The Post's documentary: Pathways to power.\\n\\nHis growing network was composed mostly of nonprofits called social welfare organizations, which are allowed to engage in politics as long as it's not their primary activity. It also included some public charities, which can receive tax-deductible donations and are prohibited from backing or opposing candidates for office.\\n\\nIn 2010, Leo served on the board of a tea party group called Liberty Central. Ginni Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, received $120,511 as the start-up's president that year. She later stepped down following questions about possible conflicts of interest, saying the issue had become a distraction for the group.\\n\\nIn 2012, Leo joined the boards of the nonprofit Catholic Association and an affiliated charity, the Catholic Association Foundation. They funded campaigns to rally Catholic voters and stop states from recognizing same-sex marriage.\\n\\nThe two Catholic nonprofits launched a third organization called Catholic Voices. Its stated mission was to train Catholic lay members to advocate for religious and conservative causes, some of whom later wrote letters for publication in major newspapers condemning the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal.\\n\\nThe next year, Leo joined forces with wealthy conservative donor Rebekah Mercer and Stephen K. Bannon, then the chairman of Breitbart News, on the board of a small charity known as Reclaim New York. Mercer and Bannon would go on to play central roles in Trump's insurgent campaign, Mercer as a leading financial backer and Bannon as campaign chief.\\n\\nIn the year Leo joined Mercer's group, and in the two following years, the Mercer family became a leading benefactor of the Federalist Society, donating a total of nearly $6 million, tax filings show.\\n\\nFormer White House counsel Donald McGahn, a Federalist Society member, listens to Trump during a Cabinet meeting last year. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\\n\\nIn March 2016, Leo met with Trump and Federalist Society member Donald McGahn at the Washington law firm Jones Day, just as Trump was beginning to prevail in his quest to be the Republican nominee, Leo told The Post.\\n\\nJustice Scalia had just died, and the men were mulling the implications. McGahn had come up with the idea of generating a list of potential Supreme Court nominees that Trump could disclose to win over moderates. Leo said he briefed Trump about the current composition of the court, the ideology of the justices and the like.\\n\\nAs Leo tells it, Trump was open to one of his long-held goals: A federal court system dominated by conservative judges who believe the Constitution must be interpreted literally.\\n\\nLeo later gave the president a list of possible Supreme Court nominees. Trump released the list during the primary campaign, a gesture that helped him win the support of skeptical mainstream Republicans. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were added to the list later.\\n\\nJCN, the group that has office space on the same hall as the Federalist Society, launched a $7 million media campaign to bolster the Republican-controlled Senate in preventing Obama from filling the seat, according to a JCN news release at the time. Working on the campaign was Creative Response Concepts, a firm that was hired by multiple nonprofits in Leo's network, tax filings show.\\n\\nCRC's president, Greg Mueller, describes himself as a friend of Leo. Mueller's firm gained prominence during the presidential campaign of 2004 for helping to promote the swift boat allegations, unsubstantiated claims that Democratic candidate John F. Kerry's war record in Vietnam was exaggerated. Among its clients now is the Federalist Society.\\n\\nMueller said in a statement that the firm does not discuss its work for clients.\\n\\nAs the 2016 election campaign heated up, Leo became president of three new nonprofits whose tax filings and incorporation records illustrate how his network sometimes operates. The groups — called BH Fund, the Freedom and Opportunity Fund and America Engaged — were formed by an employee at Holtzman Vogel Josefiak Torchinsky, a Warrenton, Va., law firm with deep ties to the conservative movement. The nonprofits reported having no employees and no websites. They had virtually no public presence. Leo's role as president of all three groups was not disclosed for nearly three years because of lags in how nonprofit groups report their annual operations to the IRS.\\n\\nAll three hired CRC for public relations and consulting.\\n\\nIn 2016 and 2017, the three nonprofits raised about $33 million, with the BH Fund taking in $24,250,000 from a single donor whose identity is still not publicly known, documents show. BH Fund then gave a total of almost $3 million to the two other Leo groups, Freedom and Opportunity Fund and America Engaged. The Center for Responsive Politics published details about the groups' spending in February.\\n\\nIn 2017, America Engaged passed on almost $1 million to the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association. That same year, the NRA announced a $1 million ad campaign in support of Gorsuch. The ads targeted lawmakers in Montana, Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota who had supported Obama's calls for gun control. Your freedom is on the line, the ads stated.\\n\\nThe media blitz coincided with yet another campaign to promote Gorsuch's nomination, by Judicial Crisis Network. JCN announced that it would spend $10 million, calling it the most robust operation in the history of confirmation battles. CRC, its media consultant on the campaign, later boasted that online videos, television ads, pundit commentary, opinion essays and other material supporting Gorsuch had been viewed 1.2 billion times.\\n\\nLeo's Freedom and Opportunity Fund, meanwhile, distributed $4 million to Independent Women's Voice over two years.\\n\\nLeonard Leo guides a network of nonprofits to promote conservative judges and causes.

Being branded as neutral but actually having the people who know, know that you're actually conservative puts us in a unique position.\\n\\nLeo's nonprofit network In 2016, Leonard Leo created three new nonprofits. All three nonprofits have no employees, no office space, no website and virtually no public profile. Watch The Post's documentary: Pathways to power.\\n\\nLeonard Leo's work in the nonprofit world has proved lucrative.\\n\\nThe Federalist Society, a charity, has regularly paid him more than $400,000 in annual compensation in recent years, tax filings show. In 2016, the Catholic Association paid him $120,000 for management consulting.\\n\\nLeo's only other publicly known employer is an obscure for-profit start-up called the BH Group. It was registered in Virginia on Aug. 22, 2016, by the same law firm employee who incorporated the BH Fund and the two other nonprofits Leo started earlier that year. The firm is based out of a virtual office suite used as a shared mailing address and meeting space for unrelated companies.\\n\\nIn the two years following its formation, the BH Group received more than $4 million from the Judicial Crisis Network, a related group called the Judicial Education Project and a third nonprofit in the network called the Wellspring Committee, all of them connected to Leo through funding, personnel and the same accountant, IRS filings show. The groups described the payments in IRS filings as consulting, research and public relations fees.\\n\\nLeo, who disclosed BH Group as his employer in a campaign finance filing, declined to say how much money he received from the company or provide any other details about it.\\n\\nBH Group is a private firm whose team of professionals, which includes Leonard Leo, provides management and consulting services to philanthropists and nonprofits, a CRC spokesman for Leo said in a statement. Like similar firms on the Left, its clients are private as are the details of the work for them.\\n\\nIn December 2016, while Leo worked on Trump's transition team, BH Group donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, according to a campaign finance disclosure.\\n\\nThe next year, Leo and his wife, Sally, were named Stewards of Saint Peter by the Papal Foundation, an honor given to those who pledge to donate $1 million or more for Vatican initiatives worldwide.\\n\\nThe Leos and their six children have lived in a McLean home that was purchased in 2010 for $710,000, according to real estate records. They paid off a 30-year mortgage last August and two months later bought a $3.3 million summer home with 11 bedrooms in an affluent seaside village on the coast of Maine. In a statement, Leo described the mansion as a retreat for our large family and for extending hospitality to our community of personal and professional friends and co-workers.\\n\\nLeo speaks to reporters at Trump Tower in New York shortly after Donald Trump's election in 2016. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)\\n\\nLeo's work to influence judicial nominations has made him a hero to some conservative activists. The esteem was evident in February at the closed-door meeting of the nonprofit Council for National Policy, where Leo serves on the board of governors.\\n\\nHe is one of us. He cares about the Constitution. He understands that elections may come and go, but judges with lifetime appointments . . . are going to be here for a long time, Rebecca Hagelin, a board member, told the assembled activists and donors.\\n\\nAnd this is perhaps where Donald Trump is making his greatest, longest-lasting effort. But he's doing it based on a lot of the work by Leonard Leo. And today I'm so pleased to introduce him, she said. Welcome him to the stage, and thank him for all the work that he is doing to help save America.\\n\\nDalton Bennett, Alice Crites and Andrew Ba Tran contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Paul ridiculed Romney as someone running around saying, 'I'm holier than thou, look at me.' \\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, meanwhile, was somewhat restrained, following counsel from his aides to shrug off Romney's salvo.\\n\\nSome hosts and guests on cable news shows commented on the Washington Post op-ed written by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Jan. 2. (Allie Caren/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI wish Mitt could be more of a team player, Trump told reporters at a Cabinet meeting.\\n\\nBut Romney's friends and leading anti-Trump conservatives were glad to see him herald his arrival in Washington by writing a cutting op-ed piece in The Washington Post that said the president has not risen to the mantle of the office. The move was taken as a gesture of solidarity at a time of mounting anxiety among establishment Republicans.\\n\\nIt gives permission for people to consider things and discuss things that were almost taboo before this, in terms of a challenger to Trump, said William Kristol, a conservative commentator. It's a permission slip to have a real conversation about 2020.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) published an op-ed Jan. 1 criticizing President Trump. Here's a look back at their relationship. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\\n\\nIt begins, former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon wrote in an email to The Post, referring to what he sees as Romney allies' efforts to block Trump from the 2020 Republican nomination.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpeaking Wednesday afternoon to CNN's Jake Tapper, Romney said he is not planning to run in 2020 but is going to see what the alternatives are.\\n\\nMany mainstream Republicans are increasingly alarmed by Trump's behavior and willing to battle with him in ways that would have seemed strained two years ago, when Trump had the party tightly in his grip after his stunning victory and its members largely fell into lockstep behind him.\\n\\nTwo years later, Trump's presidency is under siege following Republican losses in the 2018 elections. An ongoing government shutdown, volatile financial markets, the special counsel probe, right-wing discontent over Trump's failure to secure funding for a border wall, and empowered House Democrats all loom before the president, who has been isolated and lashing out at his critics. The collision of threats has frayed the bonds between Trump and some top Republicans even as the president retains strong support in polls of party voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn addition, some Republican leaders have been rattled by the departure of Jim Mattis as secretary of defense in the wake of Trump's decision to end the U.S. military operation in Syria, along with the exit of White House chief of staff John F. Kelly. Both former generals were seen as steadying presences.\\n\\nEnter Romney, 71, who has decided to lay down a marker underscoring those concerns with far more national political capital on hand than most Republicans. While others have spoken out — including some departing senators — they have often struggled to capture the party's attention during crises in Trump's first two years in office.\\n\\nRomney, as the party's 2012 presidential nominee, a former Massachusetts governor and business executive with a powerful financial network, brings a new stature to the anti-Trump bloc of the party that has been missing as Republicans in Washington have operated in a bargaining fashion with Trump, enduring his slights and erratic actions to push through favored policy items.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn matters that relate to the divisiveness of our political environment, I'll speak out if I feel the need to, if there's something significant, and I think it's important as I begin this new job to make it very clear where I stand, Romney said on CNN, adding that he backs the president's attempt to secure funding for a border wall but feels compelled to criticize him on issues that include Trump's comments on race and women to the abrupt way he believes the president is conducting U.S. foreign policy.\\n\\nRomney, however, was greeted with a burst of skepticism among both Republicans and Democrats, who pointed to his history of flip-flopping on his view of Trump, which has veered from uneasy embrace of his presidential endorsement (2012) to stern rebuke (2016) to accepting his endorsement again for his Utah Senate race (2018) to this latest rebuke (2019).\\n\\nI endorsed him and he thanked me profusely, Trump reminded reporters on Wednesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe image of a smiling Romney sitting with Trump over a dish of frog legs at a white-tablecloth dinner in late 2016 was being widely circulated by Romney critics as a reminder of his past ingratiation, in that instance as he considered joining Trump's Cabinet as secretary of state. Trump aides say the president never came close to tapping him.\\n\\nThose rebuttals are unlikely to quiet Romney or similarly minded Republicans. The notion of Trump's presidency being in deep descent has become a near-daily discussion throughout the broader Republican establishment in recent weeks, according to more than a dozen consultants and lawmakers involved in those conversations.\\n\\nOnce-fanciful suggestions about organizing a draft campaign for Romney or Nikki Haley, Trump's former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, have suddenly turned more serious, the consultants and lawmakers said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEveryone is trying to figure out what the party looks like if Trump ends the year looking extremely weak or maybe [Vice President] Pence is president, said one veteran Republican financier who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private exchanges.\\n\\nDespite his past denunciations, Romney's move took some of his associates by surprise. For weeks, Romney has been tight-lipped as he prepares to be sworn in on Thursday, disappointing those who had hoped he would emerge as a new power center for what is left of mainstream Republicans in Trump's Washington.\\n\\nStill, some Romney allies, such as his former adviser Mike Murphy, have been talking up a 2020 run for months without Romney's involvement, hoping to stoke interest and lay the political groundwork for him should Trump be impeached or resign.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump seemed like a bumbling incompetent in many ways, so what's the opposite of that — who is a comfortable Republican, super-confident, safe, no-drama choice? It's Mitt, Murphy said last year.\\n\\nSpencer Zwick, the political adviser who built Romney's donor network for his presidential campaigns, routinely takes calls from donors urging Romney to look hard at 2020, according to two people familiar with those discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\n\\nRegardless of Romney's political future, there remains a void in the GOP for figures like him to have more of a say over the direction of the party as Trump continues to buck dogma on trade and national security, Democrats take control of the House and dozens of Democratic presidential hopefuls begin traveling to early voting states and tear into Trump's character and record.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe absence of the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.), coupled with the retirements of GOP senators Bob Corker (Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.), has only intensified the angst among Republicans who see Trump as unbound by criticism from within the party.\\n\\nUnlike Romney, the departing senators have not ruled out challenging Trump. Flake has repeatedly said he is considering a 2020 run. Corker said last month, I haven't ruled it out, and suggested that Trump might not run for reelection. A 2016 Trump foe, outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, already has traveled to early voting states and publicly left his options open.\\n\\nSomebody does need to challenge the president, Flake told CNN last week. I'm a long way from there, but somebody needs to and I think that the country needs to be reminded of what it means to be conservative, certainly on the Republican side, and what it means to be decent as well.\\n\\nBut Trump has cultivated intense support among many Republican base voters, making any primary run against him difficult, and imperiling Romney's own path forward in both the Senate and, potentially, the 2020 primaries.\\n\\nMessrs. Romney, Flake, and Kasich will continue chasing their fantasy of being president, even if that means destroying our party and denying President Trump reelection, Jevon O.A. Williams, an RNC member, wrote in an email late Tuesday to fellow party leaders, urging them to change the party's rules to make any primary challenge a burden.\\n\\nBeyond Washington, flickers of data are being passed around by Trump critics as manna for their cause, such as a poll last month of Iowa Republicans by the Des Moines Register and CNN. That poll showed about 63 percent of Iowa Republicans would welcome the chance to consider challengers to Trump in Iowa, home to the first contest of the 2020 nominating race.\\n\\nIn that same poll, however, Trump holds an 81 percent approval rating among Iowa Republicans, making clear their continued support for the president.\\n\\nIn New Hampshire, the first primary state and where challengers to sitting presidents have historically gained traction, there is a fierce debate about whether the state party should endorse Trump and curb the chances of a primary fight. Gov. Chris Sununu (R), a Trump ally, has said he sides with the Republicans who want to protect the state's tradition of having the party stay away from endorsing.\\n\\nKasich, who spent months campaigning in New Hampshire ahead of the 2016 primary, where he placed second a distant second to Trump, has been frank about that political reality and the uphill climb any Trump challenger would face.\\n\\nI don't get into things that I don't think I can win, he said last month at an event in Ohio. Right now, today, inside the Republican Party, I can't beat him in a primary.\\n\\nYet on Twitter and in phone calls late Tuesday and Wednesday across the Republican Party, Romney's op-ed piece sparked new talk of an uprising.\\n\\nOf course, it was an op-ed piece, not a showdown on the Senate floor. And Romney, an imperfect messenger, was typically careful in his choice of words. But it was something for anti-Trump Republicans to seize on and hope that months of grousing and discussions could eventually yield a viable challenge to an incumbent they loathe."}
{"original": "Roy, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, persuaded six of the most committed conservatives in the House to sign onto a statement he drafted Sunday that makes a blunt case for counting all the electors submitted by the states. The centerpiece of his argument is that failing to do so will create dangerous precedents and open a Pandora's box that would eventually doom the electoral college.\\n\\nFrom a purely partisan perspective, Republican presidential candidates have won the national popular vote only once in the last 32 years, Roy wrote in his statement. They have therefore depended on the electoral college for nearly all presidential victories in the last generation. If we perpetuate the notion that Congress may disregard certified electoral votes — based solely on its own assessment that one or more states mishandled the presidential election — we will be delegitimizing the very system that led Donald Trump to victory in 2016, and that could provide the only path to victory in 2024.\\n\\nThe other signatories are Reps. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.), Ken Buck (R-Colo.), Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Tom McClintock (R-Calif.).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) has also emphasized the imperative for Republicans to safeguard the sanctity of the electoral college in opposing Cruz and Co. Congress would imperil the Electoral College, which gives small states like Arkansas a voice in presidential elections, he said in a statement. Democrats could achieve their long-standing goal of eliminating the Electoral College in effect by refusing to count electoral votes in the future for a Republican president-elect.\\n\\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) forwarded Roy's statement to the Senate Republican Conference. With respect to presidential elections, there is no authority for Congress to make value judgments in the abstract regarding any state's election laws or the manner in which they have been implemented, Lee emailed his colleagues on Monday.\\n\\nThis message was seen as giving cover to other Republicans because Lee, whose father was President Ronald Reagan's solicitor general, helped devise President Trump's impeachment defense strategy in the Senate last year. Lee even appeared at Trump's rally in Georgia on Monday night, where he was chastised by the president for not trying to overturn the election results.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpeaking at Trump's Georgia rally, Kelly Loeffler – whose name appears on the ballot in today's runoff – became the 13th GOP senator to publicly announce that she will oppose certifying Biden's victory. She declared that she is going to try to get the legally certified electoral votes from her own state thrown out, as opposed to letting them be counted for Biden. The effort will fail. But it is notable that Loeffler is willing to effectively disenfranchise the 10.62 million people she is supposed to represent – since she has tied her political fortunes entirely to the lame-duck Trump.\\n\\nIn this vein, Roy did something else clever on Sunday evening as the new Congress was sworn in. To make a point, he objected to the swearing-in of all members from the six states where Trump falsely claims the vote was rigged. This forced the House to vote on whether the lawmakers who were on the same ballot with the president – and won their races – should be allowed to take the oath. Naturally, Republicans wanted to seat their members from Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The vote was 371 to 2 to say that all of their elections were legitimate.\\n\\nIt would confound reason if the presidential results of these states were to face objection while the congressional results of the same process escaped public scrutiny, Roy said. Those representatives were elected through the very same systems – with the same ballot procedures, with the same signature validations, with the same broadly applied decisions of executive and judicial branch officials – as were the electors chosen for the president of the United States under the laws of those states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn a conference call last Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his caucus that, in his 36 Senate years, he has twice cast votes to take the nation to war and once to remove a president, but that the vote he will cast this Wednesday to certify [Biden's victory] will be the most important of his career, legendary conservative columnist George Will reports. The day before McConnell's somber statement, Missouri's freshman Republican senator, Josh Hawley, announced that on Wednesday, 14 days before Biden will be inaugurated, he will challenge the validity of Biden's election. Hawley's conscience regarding electoral proprieties compels him to stroke this erogenous zone of the GOP's 2024 presidential nominating electorate. …\\n\\nHawley — has there ever been such a high ratio of ambition to accomplishment? — and Cruz have already nimbly begun to monetize their high-mindedness through fundraising appeals, Will continues. On Wednesday, the members of the Hawley-Cruz cohort will violate the oath of office in which they swore to defend the Constitution from enemies 'foreign and domestic.' They are its most dangerous domestic enemies.\\n\\nTune in for our live special report on the Georgia runoffs.\\n\\nI will join Libby Casey in The Post's newsroom tonight from 7 p.m. Eastern until midnight to analyze and assess returns as they come in from the Peach State.

He has asked several advisers in recent weeks for advice on what he should do instead of attending [Biden's] inauguration on Jan. 20.\\n\\nAt a rally for the Senate candidates last night in Dalton, Ga., Trump opened by declaring that there's no way he lost the state: The president also falsely said he had won reelection 'in a landslide' and suggested that he expects Vice President Pence to make it so when he fulfills his constitutional duty to preside over Wednesday's joint session … Trump has complained that he does not think he will get credit if [David] Perdue and Loeffler win but will be blamed if they lose … Trump became the first Republican presidential candidate to lose Georgia in three decades. … 'Honestly, I think that he cannot handle being the sitting Republican president that lost Georgia,' said a GOP official in frequent touch with the White House. … Georgia's voting systems manager, Gabriel Sterling, refuted Trump's voter fraud claims point by point at a news conference Monday in Atlanta. 'This is all easily, provably false, yet the president persists,' Sterling said.\\n\\nTrump tried to reach Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) at least 18 times before Saturday's call, but the calls were patched to interns in the press office who thought it was a prank and didn't realize it was actually the president on the line, according to Raffensperger's deputy. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows arranged Saturday's conversation after collecting all the participants' cellphone numbers and connecting them directly.\\n\\nQuote of the day\\n\\nThe divide in the party is whether it's appropriate to pull the pin on an electoral college grenade, hoping that there are enough responsible people standing around who can shove it back in before they detonate American democracy, said Republican operative Josh Holmes, an outside adviser to McConnell and his former chief of staff.\\n\\nThroughout the call, Trump displayed an extraordinary degree of reliance on lawyer Cleta Mitchell.\\n\\nMitchell has stayed out of the spotlight, even as her behind-the-scenes role escalated. Her role as a Trump legal adviser has surprised some colleagues, particularly because she is a partner at a major law firm, Foley & Lardner, that immediately faced questions about whether it endorsed such work. In a statement Monday, the firm said it was 'aware of, and are concerned by, Ms. Mitchell's participation in the January 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly.' The firm noted as a matter of policy, its attorneys do not represent 'any parties seeking to contest the results of the presidential election,' although it did allow attorneys to observe recounts voluntarily as private citizens, Michael Kranish and Tom Hamburger report.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMitchell, 70, began her political career as a Democrat, helping win passage of Oklahoma's Equal Rights Amendment for women … Mitchell, then known by her maiden name of Deatherage, married Duane Draper, a fellow Oklahoman, and divorced in 1982. He later came out as a gay man, became director of the Massachusetts AIDS policy office and died in 1991; he had the disease when he died. Mitchell married her second husband, Dale Mitchell, chairman of the board of Fidelity National Bank, in 1984, taking his last name. … Two years later, she ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the Democratic primary. In 1992, Dale Mitchell was convicted of bank fraud, an experience that Cleta Mitchell later said was the result of 'overreaching government regulation.' She became increasingly disenchanted with the social liberal policies she had supported and moved to Washington to become director of the Term Limits Institute. Then she started doing legal work for the Republican Party and the National Rifle Association.\\n\\nA Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Georgia abruptly resigns, raising suspicions of untoward pressure.\\n\\nThe top federal prosecutor in Atlanta left his position on Monday without warning. In the call with Raffensperger, Trump referred to him angrily as the Never Trumper U.S. attorney in Atlanta as he complained that criminal charges were not being pursued over what the president claims, without evidence, is voter fraud. Byung J. 'BJay' Pak, who was appointed by Trump, announced his resignation as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia in a news release. The statement did not say why Pak was leaving or what he plans to do next, the AP reports. Pak was a Republican state lawmaker from 2011 to 2017, had previously served as an assistant U.S. attorney from 2002 to 2008 and was working in private practice at the time of his appointment. … A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond Monday to questions about what sparked Pak's sudden resignation or whether acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen had sought the departure. Pak's resignation comes nearly a month after the departure of Charlie Peeler, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 to serve as U.S. attorney for the Macon-based Middle District of Georgia. Peeler resigned on Dec. 11.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDominion Voting System plans to sue Sidney Powell, another lawyer giving advice to Trump, for defamation.

The president has directly pressed his running mate to find alternatives to certifying Biden's win, including preventing him from receiving 270 electoral votes and trying to force the election be thrown to the House, the Times reports . Pence actually has no unilateral power to affect the election's outcome. Trump and his staff have also floated the idea of delaying Biden's inauguration, even though it is set in stone by the Constitution, per the NYT\\n\\nAlmost 200 of the nation's top business leaders urged Congress to certify Biden's win in a letter, arguing attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy.

Biden turned Trump's efforts to overturn the November election results into a rallying cry to drive Democrats to the polls on Tuesday … At the final public rallies for Loeffler, her loudest applause came not when discussing her background in business, or the 'radical liberal' agendas of the Democrats, but when discussing Republican challenges to the Nov. 3 vote. … The Democratic candidates spent the closing days of the race trying to refocus the campaign on more local concerns such as health care and jobs, even as they brought in star power to help seal the deal and continued to jab at Trump. A closing ad for [Jon] Ossoff featured narration by former president Barack Obama and a musical appearance by John Legend. … Democrats, who have long considered themselves underdogs in the runoff contests, have been cheered by early vote numbers and clear signs in the state that many core Democratic constituencies, including suburban and urban voters, remained engaged.\\n\\nThe Georgia runoff has an explicitly racist history. In an hour-long special episode of the excellent Post Reports podcasts, our colleagues Martine Powers and Ted Muldoon report the runoff system was conceived in the 1960s by a staunch segregationist who proclaimed that runoffs would prevent the Negro bloc vote from controlling the elections. You can find a full transcript of their report here, but the part about the Jim Crow origins of the runoff system starts at about the 26-minute mark. Essentially, the Georgia system was invented to subvert the mandates of the Voting Rights Act and ensure White candidates for statewide offices would always have an edge. Even now, the runoff system essentially serves to ensure many votes from Black, Brown, rural, and low-income people don't ultimately get counted. It's a fascinating, albeit depressing, story.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA new Facebook ad from Loeffler's campaign artificially darkens the skin of her Black opponent, Raphael Warnock.

That figure represents an increase of more than 2,800 patients from the previous day, Antonia Farzan reports. The largest jump was reported in California, where more than 22,000 patients were hospitalized with covid-19 as of Monday, more than any other state. Highlighting the dire toll that the surge is taking, ambulance crews in hard-hit Los Angeles County were told Monday to ration their use of oxygen due to widespread shortages at hospitals.

In recent days, some public health experts have debated whether it is worth taking a scientific gamble by altering the two-dose regimen that proved highly effective in trials to maximize the number of people partially protected with at least one shot as the pandemic surges. The debate is playing out as the United States struggles with administering the doses it already has. More than 15 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data updated Monday morning, but only about 4.5 million have been administered. … Last week, the United Kingdom made the controversial decision to prioritize giving a first dose of its authorized vaccines — even if it meant there wasn't enough to give people a booster shot within the recommended three to four weeks. U.K. authorities have said people could wait as long as 12 weeks.

In D.C., the number stands at about 17,000 of 40,075 delivered doses. In one D.C. case, two men who are not in priority to receive the vaccine were given their shots after first responders missed their appointments for a vaccination at a Giant Foods supermarket.

All too often, homeless children — of whom there are 2.5 million every year in America — combine these factors, Hannah Natanson reports. Trying to learn inside shelters for the past nine months, students have faced spotty WiFi, crowded rooms, high noise levels and harassment from some peers who deduce, over Zoom, that they lack a home. … School officials in Northern Virginia, and nationwide, have gone to great lengths to reach vulnerable, struggling and low-income children. They have expanded Internet into school parking lots, provided families with WiFi hotspots and hand-delivered needed devices to households, including Chromebooks and iPads. … But homeless children pose a unique challenge.

People's claims have been held up for months at times for something as simple as a typo or uploading a scan of a driver's license instead of a photo. Most delays are the result of three key factors: extensive fraud prevention checks, antiquated computer systems and applications being flagged for extra scrutiny. Claims set aside for manual review often take months to resolve.

That has left hundreds of small publishers struggling to deliver their products, according to the National Newspaper Association, undercutting their advertising revenues and subscriber bases, and depriving the largely rural communities they serve of crucial news coverage. Some news operations have even called on reporters and editors to deliver papers. They're also staring down rate increases of as much as 9 percent in 2022 and for years thereafter.

The 'Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science' rule, which the administration began pursuing early in Trump's term, would require researchers to disclose the raw data involved in their public health studies before the agency could rely upon their conclusions. It will apply this new set of standards to 'dose-response studies,' which evaluate how much a person's exposure to a substance increases the risk of harm. … Many of the nation's leading researchers and academic organizations, however, argue that the criteria will actually restrict the EPA from using some of the most consequential research on human subjects because it often includes confidential medical records and other proprietary data that cannot be released due to privacy concerns.\\n\\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler — a former lobbyist for the coal, chemical and uranium industries — will announce the final rule at a virtual session hosted today by the Competitive Enterprise Institute.

{"original": "1) There are 8 presidential candidates\\n\\nThe last official survey results, released Feb. 8 before a government-imposed media blackout, showed a tight race. Front-runners are the ruling Alianza PAIS (AP) candidate, Lenín Moreno, who served as vice president from 2007 to 2013; and the Creando Oportunidades (CREO) movement's Guillermo Lasso, a conservative former economy minister and banker who was a distant presidential runner-up in 2013.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Feb. 8 survey of decided and undecided voters gave Moreno 32 percent of likely votes versus 21 percent for Lasso, and 14 percent for former congresswoman Cynthia Viteri. The center-left ex-mayor of Quito, Paco Moncayo, has just 8 percent support, and the four other candidates representing minor parties are polling at 4 percent or less for each. Nearly 12 percent of respondents would cast a null vote to reject the field.\\n\\nHowever, a whopping 35 percent of these voters are undecided, meaning more than a third of Ecuadorians are not wedded to a single candidate, adding a high degree of uncertainty to Sunday's proceedings.\\n\\n2) This is what Ecuador's electoral system looks like\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEcuador uses a two-round voting system for its presidential election. To win outright and avoid a runoff election, presidential candidates need to get 40 percent of the vote and hold at least a 10 percent advantage over the nearest rival in the first round. The poll numbers suggest no candidate will win outright, however.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt seems likely that Moreno will end up in an April 2 runoff with Lasso or Viteri. Given political polarization in the country, the opposition hopes that anti-government sentiment will push voters to coalesce around a single candidate.\\n\\nEcuadorians will also cast National Assembly votes this Sunday, using the rare free list electoral system, which is somewhat like an extreme version of open lists. Some countries elect their parliaments or congresses using an open list, which lets voters choose among candidates on the list. Others use a closed electoral list, where voters vote for the party itself, rather than individual candidates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEcuador's system, however, allows voters to choose individuals not only within party lists, but among different parties as well. In other words, voters may choose an entire slate of candidates from their party — as in a closed-list system — or cast individual nominal votes among the candidates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n3) How have rules and voter behavior boosted representation by women?\\n\\nIn 2015, Ecuador boasted the third-highest percentage of female legislators in Latin America (53 of 137 assembly members, or 39 percent of its unicameral legislature), behind only Bolivia (53 percent) and Nicaragua (40 percent). Just 25 years earlier, women failed to exceed even 7 percent of Ecuador's legislature.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany of these great strides reflect Ecuador's legislative efforts on gender representation. In 1997, lawmakers introduced a 20 percent quota on party lists, which would increase by 5 percent for each election cycle until parity was achieved.\\n\\nThis law was replaced by Articles 99(1) and 160 of the 2009 Electoral Law, which establish a 50 percent quota — parity — and the alternation of male and female candidates on proportional representation candidate lists, known as the zipper method. This means if a party won four seats in a district, for instance, it would be represented in Congress by two male and two female legislators.\\n\\n4) How might the unusual voting system affect women's representation in 2017?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a working project, Tom Mustillo of Purdue University and I found that, buoyed by Correa's strong presidential coattails and high public approval, AP voters tend to use the party-list option under the free list. But opposition voters tend to cast individual votes across party lines.\\n\\nThe effects on women's representation are noticeable. Of the 53 female legislators elected in 2013, 46 were Alianza PAIS candidates, and only 7 came from other parties. In fact, as Figure 1 shows, 46 percent of AP legislators were women, compared with just 19 percent of opposition legislators.\\n\\nAP voters may be more enlightened with regard to gender than are voters at large. But it's likely that the way voters use the free-list system affects the effectiveness of laws enacted to create gender quotas. Without Correa at the helm of AP, will voters shy away from party lists? If so, the percentage of female legislators will most certainly fall in 2017.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n5) What is Ecuador's 'muerte cruzada,' and how might this affect stability?\\n\\nCorrea boasted a majority government for a large chunk of his presidency, the first president to do so since Ecuador's return to democracy in 1979. Dogged by corruption allegations surrounding the government, AP isn't likely to earn a majority in the next National Assembly. With their weak organization and national penetration, the opposition parties are even less likely to do so.\\n\\nThis matters a great deal to Ecuador's political stability. Under a weaker government, the muerte cruzada (mutual death) provision in Article 148 of the 2008 constitution gives the president the option to dissolve the National Assembly — and simultaneously cut short his own term. The government would then call for new legislative and presidential elections, with the incumbent allowed to govern by decree on urgent economic matters in the interim.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMuerte cruzada was never a legitimate threat in the latter years of Correa's presidency. However, this constitutional feature dramatically increases the risks that a divided or minority government might end in deadlock and dissolution.\\n\\nThis could lead to frequent elections and changes of government, as in the decade from 1996 to 2006, when no elected Ecuadorian president served out a full term. It could also increase the temptation for presidents to dissolve parliament so that they can govern unilaterally during the undefined interim period before new elections can be held.\\n\\nRafael Correa has dominated Ecuador's politics since 2007 through good politicking, populist policymaking and closing channels of dissent, as well as a political context he helped shape with a new constitution. While Ecuador has made great strides in women's representation and enjoyed a decade of political stability, Sunday's election may mark a step backward. One way or another, though, things are about to change."}

Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, people familiar with the matter said. Trump also believed that the information would be helpful to Democrats if it were released publicly, the people said. Schiff was the lead impeachment manager, or prosecutor, during Trump's Senate trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump learned about Pierson's remarks from Rep.

Republican members asked why the Russians would want to help Trump when he has levied punishing sanctions on their country, and they challenged Pierson to back up her claim with evidence. It is unclear how she responded.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRepublicans on the committee also accused some of the briefers from other agencies of being part of an effort to sabotage Trump's reelection, these people said. Schiff, for his part, said in a tweet Thursday evening: We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections. If reports are true, and the president is interfering with that, he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling.\\n\\nTrump became angry with Maguire and blamed him for Pierson's remarks when the two met the next day during a special briefing for Trump on election security attended by officials from other agencies, but not Pierson.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt that briefing, Trump angrily asked Maguire why he had to learn of what Pierson had said from Nunes and not from his own aides, according to administration officials with knowledge of the meeting. He said that Maguire should not have let the Capitol Hill briefing happen — particularly before he received the briefing — and that he should not have learned about it from a congressman, said one administration official.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump told Maguire and other aides in the Oval Office that he did not believe Russia was interfering to help him or planning to do so, and that the intelligence community was getting played, according to an administration official with knowledge of the meeting. He said that the information would be used against him unfairly and that he could not believe that people were believing such a story again, reflecting his opinion that Russian interference in 2016 was a hoax made up by officials with a political agenda.\\n\\nMaguire struck an apologetic tone and said he was looking into it, this official said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump gave Maguire a dressing-down, said another individual, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. That was the catalyst that led to the sidelining of Maguire in favor of Grenell, the person said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMaguire came away despondent, said another individual.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The White House did not comment on Trump's Oval Office comments to Maguire.\\n\\nTrump's removal of Maguire exacerbated long-standing tensions between intelligence officials and the president. Intelligence leaders have long been some of Trump's favorite targets on Twitter and at campaign rallies, where he portrays them as members of a deep state bent on sabotaging his reelection.\\n\\nBut officials at the agencies insist they have carried on the tradition of providing the president and his top aides with unvarnished information not infected by politics or policy agendas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGrenell has no lengthy intelligence experience. His history of pro-Trump tweets and his personal relationships with Trump's children have caused current and former officials to doubt whether he could credibly serve as the country's top intelligence official, which they said Maguire did, despite having spent his career in the military.\\n\\nWhite House officials said Trump's decision to make Grenell the acting director rather than nominate him for the permanent position reflected concerns that he might not win confirmation in the Senate, given his polarizing reputation. The president likes acting [officials] better, one White House official said.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Grenell said in a tweet that the president would nominate a permanent DNI soon and that it would not be him. A senior White House official said a nominee would be announced before March 11.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLate Thursday, Trump thanked Grenell for stepping in to serve as acting DNI in a message on Twitter. I will be nominating a terrific candidate for the job very soon. Stay tuned! The president told reporters aboard Air Force One that Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), a staunch Trump supporter who also is running for U.S. Senate, is under consideration for the permanent post.\\n\\nThe president has been focused lately on officials who are allegedly disloyal to him, particularly at the Justice Department, the National Security Council, the Pentagon and the State Department, aides said, and has heard from outside advisers that real MAGA people can't get jobs in the administration, in the words of an administration official, referring to Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.\\n\\nTrump has centralized his efforts to purge the ranks of his perceived opponents. In recent weeks he pushed out Sean Doo­cey, the head of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, over the fierce objections of some White House aides, replacing him with Johnny McEntee, Trump's former personal assistant. Trump has instructed McEntee, who lost his job in 2018 over concerns about his online gambling, to install more loyalists in government positions.\\n\\nSome of those removed from their jobs testified about the president's actions toward Ukraine during his impeachment hearings.\\n\\nTrump removed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, as well as Vindman's twin brother, who did not testify, from their positions at the National Security Council. Alexander Vindman witnessed a phone call Trump had with Ukraine's president in which Trump pressured the leader to conduct investigations of Trump's Democratic rivals.\\n\\nTrump asked for the resignation of Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who told House lawmakers the president had engineered a quid pro quo with Ukraine, conditioning a White House meeting with the country's president on investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\\n\\nThis week, Trump also asked for the resignation of John C. Rood, the official in charge of Defense Department policy, who had certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations required by law to receive U.S. aid that Trump froze.\\n\\nThe deputy national security adviser, Victoria Coates, has also been removed from her post after some colleagues, including trade adviser Peter Navarro, accused her of being the author of Anonymous, a scathing account of dysfunction in the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. Coates has strenuously denied the accusation. She was moved to an advisory position in the Energy Department.\\n\\nBy contrast, Grenell appears to be an ideal Trump appointee. The president appreciates that he publicly bashes Germany over policy disagreements. Grenell also defends the president on Fox News and on Twitter, and when he visits the White House for meetings, Trump usually wants to see him, current and former administration officials say.\\n\\nAs acting DNI, Grenell will oversee the intelligence community's efforts to combat election interference and disinformation, but he has been skeptical of Russia's role in 2016.\\n\\nRussian or Russian-approved tactics like cyber warfare and campaigns of misinformation have been happening for decades, he wrote in a 2016 opinion article for Fox News, playing down the severity of the threat. That view is at odds with the conclusions of senior U.S. intelligence officials, who have said Russia's operation in 2016 was sweeping and systematic, and unlike previous Russian or Soviet efforts."}

Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\\n\\nAbout the series Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III spent nearly two years investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump obstructed the inquiry. When his 448-page report was released in April, Mueller left one major question unanswered: whether the president broke the law. The special counsel determined that because Justice Department policy states that a president cannot be indicted, it would not be fair to take a position on whether Trump committed a crime. But his report laid out possible evidence of obstruction of justice, as well as a dramatic narrative of an anxious and angry president who tried to control a criminal investigation — even after he knew he was under scrutiny. This six-part series is drawn directly from episodes detailed in the Mueller report in which prosecutors found possible evidence of obstruction of justice, as well as congressional testimony and Washington Post reporting. Dialogue in text bubbles is taken verbatim from Mueller's report, which cited text messages, contemporaneous notes and investigative interviews with first-hand witnesses who described conversations among key players.

Read more\\n\\n1 The investigation that shadowed the first two years of President Trump's administration began quietly during the 2016 campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies suspected Russia was behind efforts to sway American voters, such as WikiLeaks' release of hacked Democratic emails. The FBI began examining ties between Trump associates and the Russian government.\\n\\nDonald Trump won the election on Nov. 8, 2016. By that time, U.S. intelligence officials had publicly blamed Russia for the release of the hacked emails, describing it as an effort to interfere with the US election process.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump scoffed at that conclusion, calling it ridiculous. He said the intelligence agencies did not know who was really responsible. It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place, he said.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe way Trump and his top advisers responded to the Russia attack set in motion a crisis that would consume his White House — and it led to the investigation of the president himself for obstruction of justice.\\n\\nBased on uniform intelligence assessments, the Russians were responsible for hacking the DNC. The first test came in late December 2016. Barack Obama was still president. With just weeks to go until Trump's inauguration, the Obama administration announced it was imposing sanctions on Russia in response to its interference in the campaign.\\n\\nTrump's advisers were concerned the fallout would hurt the United States' relationship with Russia. The president-elect saw the move as an attempt to embarrass him by suggesting his election was not legitimate.\\n\\nMichael Flynn, the incoming White House national security adviser, on vacation in the Dominican Republic, told colleagues he planned to speak with Russia's man in Washington, Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe texted an aide.\\n\\nTit for tat w Russia not good. Russian AMBO reaching out to me today.\\n\\nFlynn also spoke by phone to his deputy, K.T. McFarland, who was with the president-elect and other advisers at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private Florida estate.\\n\\n\\n\\nMcFarland told Flynn that the president-elect's team didn't want things with Russia to heat up.\\n\\nFlynn immediately called Kislyak. They discussed the sanctions — and Flynn asked Russia not to escalate the situation. It was a highly unorthodox request. Flynn was not yet representing the U.S. government.\\n\\nThe next day, Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a statement saying Russia would not retaliate.\\n\\nBack in Washington, national security officials in the Obama administration were surprised by Russia's mild reaction. But Trump tweeted an appreciative response.\\n\\nThe following week, the president-elect was briefed by intelligence agencies on Russia's efforts in the previous months to bolster his candidacy. After the meeting, Trump said in a statement that the hacks had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Jan. 12, 2017, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius reported that Flynn and Kislyak had spoken on the day the sanctions were announced. Ignatius wrote that it was unclear what they had discussed, but he questioned whether Flynn had said something to undercut the Obama administration.\\n\\nThe revelation caused a stir. Trump was already facing questions about Russia's interference in the election, and now it appeared his incoming national security adviser might have secretly undermined Obama's attempts to hold the Russians accountable.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump called incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus. What the hell is this all about?\\n\\nAfter speaking with Trump, Priebus called Flynn and told him he needed to kill the story. The boss was angry about The Post column.\\n\\nFlynn directed his deputy, McFarland, to call Ignatius and inform The Post columnist that no discussion of sanctions took place. I want to kill the story. McFarland made the call, even though she said later that she knew it was not true.\\n\\nFlynn then told other Trump advisers, including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, that he had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a round of media interviews, Pence, Priebus and incoming press secretary Sean Spicer denied that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions. They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia. Senior Justice Department officials were alarmed by their statements, especially the one by Pence. The United States routinely monitors communications of Russian officials. The Justice Department officials knew what Flynn said about his conversations with Kislyak was not true. They feared Flynn's lies gave Russia leverage over him.\\n\\nTrump was inaugurated as the 45th president on Jan. 20, 2017.\\n\\nFour days later, Flynn was interviewed by FBI agents in his White House office.\\n\\nHe lied about his conversations with Kislyak, the agents determined.\\n\\nOn Jan. 26, senior Justice Department officials Sally Yates and Mary McCord met with White House Counsel Donald McGahn at the White House. They warned him that Pence's public statements defending Flynn were not true and could make Flynn a target of blackmail by the Russians. Yates also revealed that Flynn had been interviewed by the FBI.\\n\\nThis was serious: The White House now knew that the FBI was examining Flynn's interactions with the Russian ambassador. McGahn immediately told Trump about the Justice Department warnings and that Flynn had been interviewed.\\n\\nTrump told McGahn, Priebus and senior adviser Stephen K. Bannon to look into the situation — and to keep it quiet.\\n\\nThe president was unhappy with Flynn. Not again, this guy, this stuff.\\n\\nThe next day, Jan. 27, Trump invited FBI Director James B. Comey to dinner at the White House. Trump made it clear to aides that he wanted to be alone with Comey, rejecting a suggestion by Bannon that he or Priebus also attend. When Comey arrived, he was taken aback to discover no one else was joining them.\\n\\n\\n\\nOver dinner, Trump attempted to extract a promise.\\n\\nI need loyalty, I expect loyalty. Trump I need loyalty. Comey You will always get honesty from me. Trump That's what I want, honest loyalty. Comey was uncomfortable and felt Trump was trying to secure a promise that he would protect the president's interests over anything else.\\n\\nDays later, Trump and Flynn had a one-on-one conversation in the Oval Office. The president was upset about the stories and asked his national security adviser what he told the Russian ambassador. Flynn acknowledged to Trump that he might have discussed sanctions with Kislyak.\\n\\nOn Feb. 9, The Washington Post broke the news that Flynn had in fact discussed sanctions with Kislyak before Trump took office, despite the denials from the vice president and top Trump aides.\\n\\nMcGahn and Priebus decided Flynn could not have forgotten about the details of his conversation with Kislyak and must have lied about them. They told Trump that he should fire the national security adviser.\\n\\nOn an Air Force One flight from Mar-a-Lago to Washington on Feb. 12, Trump asked Flynn whether he lied to Pence. Flynn told him that he might have forgotten details, but he did not think he lied.\\n\\nOkay. That's fine. I got it.\\n\\nBut others in the White House doubted Flynn's story.\\n\\nThe next day, Priebus told Flynn he had to resign. Flynn said he wanted to say goodbye to the president. Priebus brought Flynn into the Oval Office. We'll give you a good recommendation. You're a good guy. We'll take care of you.\\n\\nThe following day, Feb. 14, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie came to the White House to visit Trump. The two men had known each other for years, and Christie was an informal adviser.\\n\\nTrump Now that we fired Flynn, the Russia thing is over. Christie No way ... this Russia thing is far from over. Trump What do you mean? ... I fired Flynn. Christie Flynn will be like gum on the bottom of your shoe. Toward the end of lunch, Trump asked Christie to call Comey and tell him the president really liked him, adding: Tell him he's part of the team. Christie thought the suggestion was a bad idea and would put Comey in an uncomfortable position. He decided not to pass along the message.\\n\\nAt 4 p.m. that day, the president met with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Comey, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and other officials for a homeland security briefing in the Oval Office. At the end, Trump asked to speak to Comey alone. Sessions and Kushner tried to stay, but the president excused them.\\n\\nI want to talk about Mike Flynn. At one point, Priebus opened the door, but the president did not want to be interrupted. He sent his chief of staff away.\\n\\nI hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. Flynn is a good guy. Comey felt that was as much as he could say. He did not commit to letting Flynn go — which he saw as an inappropriate directive to end the investigation.\\n\\nAfter his Oval Office meeting with the president, Comey began drafting a memo documenting their conversation. He also asked Sessions, who as attorney general supervised the FBI, not to leave him alone with Trump again.\\n\\nAbout a week later, Bannon and Priebus told McFarland that the president wanted her to resign as deputy national security adviser, but they suggested that she could be appointed ambassador to Singapore. At Trump's direction, Priebus asked McFarland to put in writing that Trump did not direct Flynn to talk to Kislyak. She refused, saying she did not know whether that was true. She consulted a White House lawyer for advice, who also urged her not to write the letter. He was concerned it could be seen as a quid pro quo for the ambassador position.\\n\\n\\n\\nMcFarland resigned her White House post as requested, but did not write the letter. Trump still nominated her for the ambassadorship, but she ultimately withdrew her name from consideration amid questions about her interactions with Flynn.\\n\\nPublicly, Trump raged against his enemies.\\n\\nBut the FBI and congressional investigations were ramping up and, privately, Trump appeared concerned about what his ousted national security adviser would say. Around that time, Trump asked McFarland to pass a message to Flynn.\\n\\nThe president felt bad for Flynn, Trump told McFarland. He should stay strong.\\n\\nAudio Analysis Chapter 1: 'This Russia thing is far from over' What exactly is obstruction of justice? How do prosecutors prove a person has committed it?

{"original": "Sixty-six percent of all oxycodone sold in Florida came from this company. But the DEA's case against it faltered.\\n\\nTo combat an escalating opioid epidemic, the Drug Enforcement Administration trained its sights in 2011 on Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, one of the nation's largest manufacturers of the highly addictive generic painkiller oxycodone.\\n\\nIt was the first time the DEA had targeted a manufacturer of opioids for alleged violations of laws designed to prevent diversion of legal narcotics to the black market. And it would become the largest prescription-drug case the agency has pursued.\\n\\nUltimately, the DEA and federal prosecutors would contend that the company ignored its responsibility to report suspicious orders as 500 million of its pills ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 — 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state. Government investigators alleged in internal documents that the company's lack of due diligence could have resulted in nearly 44,000 federal violations and exposed it to $2.3 billion in fines, according to confidential government records and emails obtained by The Washington Post.\\n\\nBut six years later, after four investigations that spanned five states, the government has taken no legal action against Mallinckrodt. Instead, the company has reached a tentative settlement with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with the discussions. Under the proposal, which remains confidential, Mallinckrodt would agree to pay a $35 million fine and admit no wrongdoing.\\n\\nMallinckrodt's response was that ­'everyone knew what was going on in Florida but they had no duty to report it,'  according to an internal summary of the case prepared by federal prosecutors and obtained by The Post.\\n\\nThe case shows how difficult it is for the government to hold a drug manufacturer responsible for the damage done by its product. DEA investigators appalled by rising overdose deaths said they worked for years to build the biggest case of their careers only to watch it falter on uncertain legal territory and in the face of stiff resistance from the company.\\n\\nThey just weren't taking this seriously, and people were dying, said a former law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending. People were dying all over the place. It wasn't their kids, their wives, their husbands, their brothers. It was some hillbilly in Central Florida, so who cares?\\n\\nIn a statement, a Mallinckrodt spokesman said the company has worked hard to fight drug diversion.\\n\\nMallinckrodt has long been a recognized leader in developing and sharing best practices related to the prevention of opioid diversion and misuse, and has continuously invested significant resources to address this serious drug epidemic, the statement said. We are proud of the programs and initiatives we've developed to ensure appropriate use of pain medication and, most importantly, to deter such medications from ending up in the wrong hands.\\n\\nOfficials at the DEA declined to comment for this article. The U.S. attorney's office in Detroit, which is handling the case, issued a statement. Our office works diligently to use all the legal tools available to us to hold corporations responsible for their actions, acting U.S. attorney Daniel Lemisch said. This is particularly true in a highly regulated industry such as the manufacture of opioids. As this case is still in settlement negotiations, we cannot comment on the specifics of the matter.\\n\\nThe path of a pain pill Manufacturers The oxycodone pill's journey begins at Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.

When suspicious orders occur, companies must immediately notify the agency or risk losing their DEA licenses to sell or manufacture controlled substances, as well as face civil and criminal penalties.\\n\\nAccording to the documents and sources familiar with the settlement talks, Mallinckrodt was willing to acknowledge its responsibility to report suspiciously large orders placed by its customers, a network of wholesale distributors. But the company said that it should not be held responsible for what happens to its drugs once the distributors send them to their customers, such as doctors and pharmacies. Mallinckrodt contended that the DEA has never required manufacturers to know their customers' customers and that the agency provided the company with conflicting advice about its responsibilities under the law.\\n\\nMallinckrodt took unprecedented steps beyond the legal obligations of a manufacturer. Mallinckrodt began monitoring downstream sales between wholesalers and pharmacies, and proactively informed both its customers and the DEA of its findings, said Brien T. O'Connor, a lawyer for the company. The company continues to enhance its anti-diversion programs to this day.\\n\\nThe proposed $35 million settlement comes as the nation's prescription opioid epidemic continues to worsen, with nearly 180,000 lives lost to overdoses since 2000.\\n\\nDeaths from prescription opioid overdose continue to rise in US 15,281 15,000 The highest year on record, prescription opioids killed an average of 42 people a day. 10,000 5,000 3,785 0 2000 2015 Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention GABRIEL FLORIT/THE WASHINGTON POST\\n\\nThe Post reported in October that the DEA's civil and administrative enforcement efforts against the mammoth wholesale distributors that deliver painkillers to pharmacies stalled in the face of a stepped-up lobbying campaign by the drug industry.\\n\\nThe Mallinckrodt case was something different: an aggressive attempt to hold a drug manufacturer accountable.\\n\\nMallinckrodt was founded 150 years ago in St. Louis and became the leading supplier of chemicals for the emerging photography industry. Now based in the United Kingdom after corporate acquisitions, Mallinckrodt is one of the nation's largest manufacturers of oxycodone, a powerful opioid made from the natural painkiller found in poppies.\\n\\nWhen you get to the manufacturing level, it's hard to prove that they knew what was happening, another law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said. But they were making the product, they were selling it to the country's largest distributors, and they had a responsibility under the law to detect and report orders that were suspicious. These orders were beyond suspicious.\\n\\nThe DEA and federal prosecutors contended that Mallinckrodt manufactured 500 million pills that ended up in Florida between 2008 and 2012 — 66 percent of all oxycodone sold in the state.\\n\\nThe investigation begins\\n\\nThe first hint that Mallinckrodt might pose a problem for the DEA came not from Florida but from Tennessee.\\n\\nOn July 7, 2009, members of a Tennessee drug task force in a sting operation seized several 100-tablet bottles of ­Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone. Task force agents alerted Mallinckrodt. The company's lot numbers were printed on the labels, allowing for easy tracking of the pills.\\n\\nThree days later, Mallinckrodt responded that the oxycodone had been prescribed by Barry Schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in Delray Beach, Fla. The company said that one of its distributors, Sunrise Wholesale of Broward County, Fla., had sent 20,400 tablets of oxycodone to Schultz in the previous year.\\n\\nThe Florida Department of Health had just issued an administrative complaint against Schultz for prescribing oxycodone outside the course of his professional practice. His medical office had become a thoroughfare for those seeking easy access to drugs, records show.\\n\\nOn July 27, a Mallinckrodt security director told DEA Supervisor Paul Pete Kleissle in St. Louis about the Tennessee connection. Kleissle recommended that Mallinckrodt conduct an audit of Sunrise and the company agreed, government documents show.\\n\\nThe investigation seemed to stall there, but the events in Tennessee would later prove significant.\\n\\nAt the time, the DEA's Diversion Control Division was ramping up enforcement efforts against the nation's wholesale drug distributors — including Sunrise — warning them and drug manufacturers that they would be held accountable if they failed to report suspicious orders. Under the DEA's distributor initiative, the agency had begun to make cases against large and small wholesalers.\\n\\nIn 2010 and 2011, DEA investigators in several states started to see large amounts of Mallinckrodt's oxycodone being sent to Florida.\\n\\nBy then, Mallinckrodt's blue ­30-milligram oxycodone tablets had become so popular among drug users and dealers that they had a street name — M's, for the company's distinctive block-letter logo.\\n\\nKeySource Medical, based in Cincinnati, sent 41 million tablets of Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone to Florida in 2010, documents show. One of the pharmacies KeySource supplied was Tru-Valu Drugs in Lake Worth. With lines out the door and security measures such as a guard dog, left, and guns, Tru-Valu came under investigation by the DEA. (Federal court records)\\n\\nFlorida's lax laws, dishonest doctors and unscrupulous pharmacists had turned the state into ground zero for the nation's prescription opioid crisis.\\n\\nOne distributor that caught the attention of the DEA for sending drugs to Florida was KeySource Medical, a regional company based in Cincinnati. In 2010, it sent 41 million tablets of Mallinckrodt-made oxycodone to Florida, documents show. That was nearly 2.5 pills for every man, woman and child in the state.\\n\\nThe DEA accused KeySource in June 2011 of trying to conceal the amounts of drugs it was shipping by splitting its orders and told the company to halt its oxycodone shipments.\\n\\nMallinckrodt's oxycodone cropped up again when the DEA looked at one of the nation's three largest drug distributors, Cardinal Health, which was sending vast quantities to four pharmacies in Florida.\\n\\nThe DEA had seen enough.\\n\\nFlorida's drug overdose deaths, county by county Prescription opioids have played a key role in Florida's drug epidemic.

People involved in the case still call the gathering the earthquake meeting.\\n\\nDEA officials showed the company the remarkable amounts of its oxycodone going to distributors and the number of arrests being made for oxycodone possession and distribution on the street, according to one participant in the meeting who also spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case is pending.\\n\\nThere were a lot of follow-ups, and they said they would adjust their practices, the participant said.\\n\\nThe next day, the DEA's chief regulatory officer wrote to the agency's investigators and a federal prosecutor assigned to the case, Leslie Wizner, an assistant U.S. attorney in Detroit.\\n\\nI think we can all agree that yesterday's meeting was an eye opener for the company, and very successful, on so many levels, from DEA's perspective, Barbara J. Boockholdt wrote in an email obtained by The Post. She noted that there were pending and proposed investigations of Mallinckrodt.\\n\\nBoockholdt declined to comment. Wizner did not return calls requesting an interview.\\n\\nThree weeks after the Aug. 23 meeting, Mallinckrodt notified 43 of its distributors that they would no longer receive rebates from the company if they continued to supply certain pharmacies whose orders appeared to be suspicious.\\n\\nBut by then, the DEA and federal prosecutors had decided to take the investigation of the company to another level.\\n\\nOn Nov. 30, 2011, the DEA served a subpoena on Mallinckrodt, demanding documents related to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, according to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\nProsecutors said that the Mallinckrodt drugs that Sunrise sent to Schultz in the six weeks after Mallinckrodt was notified of the Tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street.\\n\\nConfidence grows\\n\\nThe subpoena brought a windfall of information. The DEA gained access to data from Mallinckrodt's rebate or chargeback program, an industry-wide practice that provides reimbursements to wholesale distributors. That information and other records showed where Mallinckrodt's oxycodone was going — from the company to its network of distributors to retailers down the chain.\\n\\nThe significance of the Tennessee case started to become clear.\\n\\nThe DEA learned that in the six weeks after the Tennessee task force alerted Mallinckrodt to the drugs found in the 2009 sting operation, the company had shipped another 2.1 million tablets of oxycodone to Sunrise, the Florida distributor.\\n\\nThe DEA also discovered that Sunrise, over an 11-month period, had sent at least 92,400 tablets to Schultz, the Delray Beach doctor who prescribed the pills found in Tennessee. In one day, he had prescribed 1,000 tablets to one patient.\\n\\nAt the time, the street value of oxycodone was $30 a tablet. The Mallinckrodt drugs that Sunrise sent to Schultz after Mallinckrodt was notified of the Tennessee sting were worth nearly $2.8 million on the street, prosecutors said.\\n\\nBarry Schultz, a doctor who ran a medical clinic in Delray Beach, Fla., was sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2016. He was charged with drug trafficking and manslaughter after one of his patients died of an overdose. (Bruce R. Bennett/Palm Beach Post)\\n\\nProsecutors were becoming increasingly confident in their case. Under pressure from the DEA, Sunrise had surrendered its license to distribute narcotics. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office had arrested Schultz, charging him with drug trafficking and manslaughter because one of his patients died of a drug overdose. Schultz was later convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison.\\n\\nMallinckrodt knew through law enforcement reports that Barry Schultz was diverting controlled substances, and that the diverted oxycodone was supplied by Mallinckrodt through Sunrise, prosecutors later wrote in an internal document sent to the company. When Mallinckrodt continued to distribute oxycodone to Sunrise for such purposes, and continued to pay incentives in the form of chargebacks for the product sales to Barry Schultz, Mallinckrodt was diverting oxycodone.\\n\\nIn Oct. 22, 2012, the DEA served Mallinckrodt with another subpoena for records relating to its suspicious-order-monitoring program, the company disclosed in SEC filings.\\n\\nThose filings also showed that the DEA was examining Mallinckrodt's plant in Hobart, N.Y., about 70 miles southwest of Albany. Investigators documented scores of alleged violations, including the failure to secure narcotics, to keep accurate records or to document transfers of drugs, according to a confidential memo obtained by The Post.\\n\\nProsecutors said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious — orders that Mallinckrodt should have reported to the DEA. But the company said it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered.\\n\\nConflicting rules guidance\\n\\nIn 2014, Mallinckrodt, which is publicly traded and maintains its U.S. headquarters in St. Louis, notified its shareholders that it was under investigation by the federal government and had received subpoenas for documents.\\n\\nBut with no sign of civil action by the DEA, the company said it believed that the ultimate resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit.\\n\\nBehind the scenes, however, the case against Mallinckrodt was growing more serious.\\n\\nProsecutors said in internal documents that they found the company's behavior so egregious that they initially considered framing it as a civil conspiracy.\\n\\nMallinckrodt did knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully combine, conspire, confederate and agree with Sunrise and Barry Schultz to commit offenses against the United States, prosecutors wrote in a draft complaint against the company that was never filed. That is, to knowingly, intentionally and unlawfully distribute, dispense or prescribe controlled substances, including but not limited to the Schedule II drug oxycodone 30 mg.\\n\\nO'Connor, the Mallinckrodt lawyer, said that the draft document reflects discredited allegations made in the heat of negotiations in 2015 and that the government and the company moved past those accusations.\\n\\nIn particular, it is wrong to suggest Mallinckrodt was involved in any conspiracy related to Dr. Barry Schultz and Sunrise Wholesale, O'Connor said. In reality, Mallinckrodt worked with law enforcement to investigate potential diversion by the physician and to audit Sunrise, and, importantly, the DEA praised the company's handling of the investigation.\\n\\nProsecutors weighed the strengths and weaknesses of their case in an internal summary they prepared Aug. 7, 2014.\\n\\nWe will argue that thousands of orders from the distributors as well as tens of thousands of orders from these down-stream customers were suspicious because of the pattern of distribution to Florida, prosecutors wrote. In all, they said they considered 43,991 orders from distributors and retailers to be suspicious — orders that Mallinckrodt should have reported to the DEA.\\n\\nA DEA agent walks out of the Cabana Pharmacy in Miami after raiding it along with police and the Florida Department of Health in October 2011.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\\n\\nProsecutors also acknowledged the weaknesses of their case in the summary. They noted that the DEA had provided conflicting guidance to Mallinckrodt about its responsibilities to report suspicious orders from retailers such as Schultz.\\n\\nFor example, Kleissle, the DEA supervisor in St. Louis, had told the company in 2010 after the Tennessee sting that it had a responsibility to keep close tabs on its customers, the distributors, as well as the distributor's customers, the pharmacies and doctors.\\n\\nBut that same year, a DEA investigator in New York, Heather White, told ­Mallinckrodt that no one in her region, including her supervisor, had heard anything about know your customer's customer and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement, according to the prosecutor's summary. White declined to comment for this article.\\n\\nMallinckrodt pushed back against the government's contention that it was responsible for the acts of downstream retail customers such as Schultz.\\n\\nThe company said during discussions with prosecutors that it was impossible to monitor all of the 55,000 retail outlets where its drugs are delivered. Mal­linckrodt also said that the DEA was aware of the company's increased sales of oxycodone and could have acted by reducing the amount of narcotics the company is permitted to sell. The DEA sets quotas for the quantities of controlled substances that can be manufactured. The company also complained that the DEA has not provided guidance on how to track suspicious orders.\\n\\nMallinckrodt has agreed to pay a settlement amount relating to orders from its distributors, prosecutors wrote in the summary. However, it refuses to negotiate any settlement relating to the downstream customers orders.\\n\\nThe company put together a ­high-powered legal team to fight on its behalf. It included O'Connor, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in fraud and corruption cases, and D. Linden Barber, a former associate chief counsel for the DEA's diversion division who was one of the architects of the agency's crackdown on the pharmaceutical industry.\\n\\nFollowing negotiations between Mallinckrodt's legal team and the U.S. attorney's office in Detroit, prosecutors dropped the civil conspiracy allegation, according to sources close to the talks. The negotiations then focused on the relationship between Mallinckrodt and its distributors, their customers and the amount of drugs that were going to Florida.\\n\\nProsecutors noted that the DEA had twice placed the industry on notice about its responsibility to report suspicious orders. They also said Mallinckrodt was aware of enforcement actions the agency had taken against distributors for failing to report the inordinate amounts of painkillers they were shipping to retail customers in states such as Florida.\\n\\nWith respect to distributor orders, prosecutors wrote in a document, ­Mallinckrodt's obligations to monitor and notify of suspicious sales were known to the company.\\n\\nFor a company the size of Mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is chump change, one government official said. In fiscal 2016, the company posted $3.4 billion in revenue and a $489 million profit .\\n\\nAbout more than money\\n\\nOn July 10, 2015, the U.S. attorney's office sent a proposed settlement offer to lawyers for Mallinckrodt.\\n\\nProsecutors said that they could fine the company as much as $2.3 billion because 222,107 orders to Florida were excessive and should have been reported as suspicious. Or they could fine the company up to $1.3 billion based on an analysis of the 217,022,834 Mallinckrodt 30 mg oxycodone tablets that were sold for cash in Florida in 2009 and 2010.\\n\\nAs you are aware, significant cash sales are an indication of diversion, prosecutors wrote in their offer.\\n\\nBut the big buildup resulted in a much smaller proposed fine. Despite the billion-dollar figures bandied about, the prosecutors proposed settling the case for $70 million. They cited the litigation risk they faced if the case went to trial, Mallinckrodt's previous legal arguments and the size of other recent settlements with drug distributors.\\n\\nThis year, on Feb. 7, Mallinckrodt told its shareholders in an SEC filing that the investigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition because it has set aside the money.\\n\\nSources close to the negotiations said that the two sides had recently reached a tentative agreement to settle the case for $35 million. With final approval pending from the Justice Department, some of those who worked on the case said they are deeply disappointed by the dollar amount of the proposed fine.\\n\\nDrug manufacturers have paid much larger fines for other misdeeds. Glaxo­SmithKline was fined $3 billion, and Pfizer was fined $2.3 billion for illegally promoting off-label drug use and paying kickbacks to doctors. Purdue Pharma paid a $600 million fine, and three of its executives pleaded guilty to charges that they misled regulators, doctors and patients about the risks of the painkiller that is widely blamed for setting off the nation's opioid crisis: OxyContin. All of those cases were initiated by the Food and Drug Administration.\\n\\nThe largest fine the DEA has levied against a drug distributor was the $150 million that McKesson, the nation's largest drug wholesaler, recently agreed to pay following allegations that it failed to report suspicious orders of painkillers.\\n\\nFor a company the size of Mallinckrodt, a $35 million fine is chump change, one government official said.\\n\\nThe problem you have is this was new ground, and it had never been done before, said another former law enforcement official with knowledge of the case. There was a lot of back and forth over whether we could pull this off. Is it ideal? No. Is this a number that everyone wants to see? No. People would probably like to see more. But this is about more than money. It's about holding a manufacturer accountable, and it will put the industry on notice.\\n\\nAlice Crites contributed to this report."}
{"original": "On one level, it's a familiar, even mundane story: Neighborhood group opposes noise and congestion at nearby institution. Legal battle ensues.\\n\\nOn another level, however, the stakes might be a bit higher: The local institution in this case is a mosque, a fact that has turned this into more than a simple neighborhood dispute.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe leader of the neighborhood group opposing the mosque is a reporter, which raises questions about whether journalists — bound to neutrality and independence — can be active players in public controversies.\\n\\nThe neighborhood group in question, the Carrington Community Association, is composed of homeowners in an upscale subdivision in Fairfax County. The community abuts the McLean Islamic Center, a mosque with about 100 members. Early last year, the mosque (known as MIC) sought to expand its morning prayer service; it asked the county to lift a cap that had restricted attendance to just 10 people.\\n\\nCarrington objected, citing the potential for increased noise in the predawn hours. Last month, the local zoning appeals board ruled in MIC's favor, lifting the cap and permitting it to expand.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe homeowners group's opposition to morning prayers wasn't its first objection, said Sultan Chaudhry, MIC's president. The community organization's president, Paul Overberg, has raised repeated concerns about MIC since it moved in in 2015, Chaudhry said. Overberg's complaints have prompted MIC's members to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on traffic and noise-mitigation studies, lawyers' fees, and landscape improvements. He's opposed us every step of the way, Chaudhry said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChaudhry said he found no record of complaints by Carrington or Overberg against other nearby businesses or organizations, including MIC's predecessor, the Berea Church of Christ.\\n\\nOverberg, a reporter for the Wall Street Journal and formerly at USA Today, declined to comment. He referred questions to Carrington's attorney and to a Journal spokesman.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn any case, his activism is unusual. Most mainstream news organizations frown on, if not outright ban, their journalists' participation in activities that could conflict with their reporting or cast them as central players in an issue. This usually means that contributing to or participating in a political cause is banned, lest it suggest that a reporter, or his news organization, is taking sides and thereby compromising their role as fair brokers of facts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut is waging opposition to a mosque's expansion the same thing?\\n\\nThe Journal says no. Asked for comment, a spokesman for the newspaper, Steve Severinghaus, issued a statement reading, Paul Overberg is a well-respected data reporter for the Wall Street Journal and his participation in this neighborhood home owners' association is not related to his reporting and poses no conflict of interest.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeveringhaus cited the Journal's code of conduct, which prohibits news employees from partisan political activity, such as passing out buttons, posting partisan comments on social-networking sites, blogging or making financial contributions. The code doesn't prohibit employees from contributing to civic, charitable, religious, public, social, or residential organizations, or other nonpartisan causes as long as these activities don't detract from [an employee's] performance or overlap with the coverage responsibilities of any news personnel.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJournalism experts say it's not so simple.\\n\\nWhile there's no actual conflict of interest because Overberg isn't using his position to influence a personal matter, there could be a perceived conflict, said Kathleen Bartzen Culver, director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin. It would be easy for people to assume his activism makes his journalism suspect, she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCulver notes that journalists can become too detached from their communities in their quest for neutrality and thus can miss important perspectives. Serving on the local PTA, for example, could be viewed as a kind of activism, she said, but it also gives journalists a different sense of a school community than reporting would.\\n\\nHowever, in this instance, she said, I think this reporter needs to carefully consider his role in the controversy, especially given sensitive religious aspects and the possibility that it could move into litigation. As a journalist, his job is to serve the public, and he should be aware if any personal activities could compromise that service, rather than enhance it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA reporter familiar with the mosque story raises other questions. Although Overberg hasn't covered religious conflicts, wouldn't his objectivity be in question among Muslim readers if he ever did? This reporter, who spoke on background, citing company policy, also asks whether a Muslim reporter who personally led a campaign to block a neighborhood church or synagogue would be accorded the same deference by his or her employer as Overberg.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEdward Wasserman, dean of the University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, called Overberg's activities awkward but said they pose more of a perception problem for his employer than an egregious ethical trespass.\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal should be worried that his involvement, even in a neighborhood squabble, will be viewed as religious intolerance, he said. A reasonable person could see this as approving the exclusion of Muslims. They would not be out of line to curtail this as a matter of brand management.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIndeed, the appearance of bias in these cases is just as important as actual bias, said Leonard Downie Jr., a former editor of The Washington Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDownie, now a journalism professor at Arizona State University, took his neutrality obligation so seriously as an editor that he declined to vote, arguing that doing so could bias his editorial judgment. But he said he permitted his staff to become involved in school, religious or family organizations and activities that weren't newsworthy.\\n\\nHe said Overberg could reconcile his community involvement and his obligations as a reporter simply by stepping back. If I were the editor of the Journal, I'd ask him: 'Why can't someone else be the leader [of the homeowners association]? Why do you have to do it?'"}
{"original": "In this day and age, two-day shipping is really just table stakes, said Marc Lore, Walmart's U.S. chief executive for e-commerce, on a conference call with reporters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe rollout of free two-day shipping is the first high-profile, customer-facing digital strategy to debut under Lore, who assumed leadership of Walmart's online offerings after the retailing behemoth bought his startup, Jet.com, for $3.3 billion. Lore suggested that more changes are on the horizon, telling reporters on Monday that things couldn't be moving any faster than they are.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWalmart has a lot of ground to make up. In the last full fiscal year, Walmart pulled down $13.7 billion in online sales worldwide, only a tiny fraction of its $499.4 billion in currency-adjusted revenue.\\n\\nWhether speedy, free shipping will prove enticing enough to woo new shoppers remains to be seen. Amazon's Prime program has grown into something much more expansive than just a shipping deal. Membership also includes services like TV streaming, digital photo storage and a program for borrowing e-books. And so begins an important experiment: Can Walmart now compete better for shoppers who haven't already been lured into the Amazon ecosystem? And can it pick off some of the ones who have stuck with Amazon purely for its shopping experience, not for its service offerings?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWalmart's free-shipping policy will only apply to two million of the 30 million products in its digital assortment, including items such as baby gear, pet supplies and cleaning products. Lore said that the two million items comprise the vast majority of what people typically buy on Walmart's website. However, the selection is still dwarfed by the 40 million items that are eligible for two-day shipping under Prime.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPrime, too, does not require a minimum purchase size. Walmart says the majority of orders placed on its website clear its $35 threshold to get free two-day shipping, so plenty of shoppers might not find it limiting. But it's possible others may find it to be a hindrance: Amazon, after all, has been conditioning them for years to place orders however they want, perhaps firing off multiple orders of single items in a matter of minutes.\\n\\nIn rolling out free two-day shipping, Walmart also announced it was doing away with a membership pilot program called Shipping Pass. The company first dipped a toe in the water on this concept back in 2015, offering unlimited three-day shipping for $49 per year to a limited group of customers. Later, the program was opened to more shoppers and switched to two-day shipping.\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "Corbyn conceded he wasn't quite sure where the cap should be set. The point I'm trying to make . . . is that we have the worst levels of income disparity of most of the OECD countries in this country, he continued, referring to the 35-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It's getting worse, and corporate taxation is a part of it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor the leftist-leaning Corbyn, raising the idea of a maximum national wage may have seemed logical. He had already suggested a salary cap during the Labour Party's 2015 leadership contest, which he went on to win, to the surprise of many of his rivals. And with growing awareness of the problems caused by economic inequality in Britain and elsewhere, perhaps it seemed the right timing to bring it up again.\\n\\nBut Corbyn has been criticized by peers and allies alike for unrealistic policy goals and a confused leadership style. And during a round of interviews Tuesday that appeared to be an attempt to rebrand himself after prolonged Labour infighting, Corbyn struggled to offer a specific vision for what a national maximum wage would look like in Britain.\\n\\nIn an interview later Tuesday with Sky News, Corbyn suggested that any cap should be somewhat higher than 138,000 pounds a year ($168,000) — his own salary. I think, certainly, the salaries that are paid to some footballers are simply ridiculous, he said. I think some of the salaries paid to very high-earning top executives of companies are utterly ridiculous.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThen in another interview again with the BBC, he admitted he wasn't totally sure how a salary limit should work in practice. Either you do a cap or you look at the levels of disparity within organizations, he told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg.\\n\\nLater still, he seemed to walk back the idea that he had favored a salary cap at all. Speaking during a question-and-answer session with journalists after a speech Tuesday afternoon, he told ITV's Robert Peston that he was most concerned about ratio levels. He added that it was probably better to look at the ratio issue because that indeed would then encourage wage rises lower down and ensure a better sharing of the resources and the profits of any company or organization.\\n\\nThe idea of attempting to limit high salaries is far from unheard of around the world — in fact, the concept holds some sway among economists who believe it would not only curb inequality but may help limit inflation. In 2013, Swiss voters rejected a national referendum that sought to limit executive pay to 12 times the wage of the firm's lowest earner. The year before, hard-left French presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon proposed a 100 percent tax rate on all salaries over 360,000 euros (around $380,000 nowadays).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe idea has even been mooted in the tax-wary United States — most notably during World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed a maximum income of $25,000. Though Congress ultimately balked at that idea, it did subsequently impose a record top tax rate of 94 percent on all income higher than $200,000.\\n\\nHowever, actual implementations of these ideas are rare. The early Soviet Union experimented with maximum wages for Communist Party members before abandoning the idea. Cuba is one of the few modern countries to actually keep a nationwide maximum wage in place for decades, and critics say the effect on the economy shows.\\n\\nCorbyn's comments led to a wide variety of criticism Tuesday. David Blanchflower, a former economics adviser to the Labour Party leader, suggested it was a totally idiotic unworkable idea, while Paul Nuttall, leader of the populist U.K. Independence Party, said it was the politics of envy that targeted Britain's financial workers."}
{"original": "Revisiting Deflategate during the Super Bowl buildup and in the immediate aftermath of the New England Patriots' stunning overtime victory was justified.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt was the culmination to the Patriots' Deflategate vengeance, after all, the triumphant end to a season that began with Tom Brady serving his four-game suspension. And everyone wanted to see the postgame interaction between NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Brady.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it's enough now.\\n\\nIt's time for everyone — everyone — to move on.\\n\\nKraft reiterated his view during Super Bowl week that the league had messed up royally in its handling of the matter. Fine. Kraft is perfectly entitled to that opinion. He said that ire over the Deflategate penalties handed out by the NFL had energized our fans and also served to motivate the team's players. Also fine. It certainly was relevant to the week's story line.\\n\\nWhen Kraft declared during the confetti-covered postgame celebration that, A lot has transpired during the last two years. . . . This is unequivocally the sweetest, that was no problem. He and the Patriots were entitled to celebrate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut that's when and where it needs to end.\\n\\nBrady handled himself with dignity before, during and (for the most part) after the game. He generally refused to engage on the topic. He shook Goodell's hand on the field afterward and appeared with Goodell at the Monday morning news conference for the game's most valuable player.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGoodell actually had a decent Super Bowl week. When he said the Wednesday before the game that he and Kraft can disagree without it being personal, that was among the most reasonable public comments he'd ever made on the matter.\\n\\nBrady took what many perceived as a dig at Goodell when the float on which he rode during the Patriots' victory parade displayed a shirt that said, Roger that and showed five Super Bowl rings, four on one hand and a fifth on the middle finger of the other. Piling on? Perhaps. But Brady had become the face of Deflategate. He was the person suspended. He felt mistreated. Right or wrong, he's probably entitled to his reaction.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt was another matter for Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia to emerge from the Patriots' plane following their ride home from Houston wearing a shirt depicting Goodell wearing a clown nose. That might play well with the Patriots' base. But it doesn't necessarily play well elsewhere. Not everyone agrees that Brady and the Patriots were victimized by an injustice; far from that. Patricia isn't a fan or even a player. He has interviewed for NFL head coaching jobs. If and when the time comes for an owner of another franchise to make a decision about whether to hire him, Patricia could have to answer for that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBrady is the greatest quarterback in the history of the sport. That distinction probably was sealed even before his fifth Super Bowl win. It is almost inarguable now. Bill Belichick's place among the best coaches ever also is secure.\\n\\nBut winning this Super Bowl did not make Brady and the Patriots right about Deflategate. Losing it would not have made them wrong about Deflategate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpygate and Deflategate remain part of the legacies of Brady, Belichick and the Patriots. Those legacies will be debated forever and, at this point, it's unlikely that anyone's mind will be changed. Either you believe that the Patriots are cheaters, or you believe that the Patriots are victims of jealous opponents attempting to sully their reputation after being unable to beat them on the field.\\n\\nThe Patriots, in truth, ended up just fine in the post-Deflategate world, even without their first-round pick in last year's NFL draft and without Brady for the first four games of the season.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey went 3-1 without Brady, reaffirming the coaching greatness of Belichick and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who now can opt to move on to a head coaching job elsewhere when he wants or stay put and hope to succeed Belichick whenever Belichick is done coaching. Backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo boosted his trade value, perhaps to the point that the Patriots can get a first-round draft choice or more for him. Brady had a 28-touchdown, two-interception season and capped it with his fourth Super Bowl MVP performance, the most remarkable Super Bowl MVP performance of all.\\n\\nSo, given all of that, the Deflategate talk can end.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCan't it?\\n\\n… AND TEN\\n\\n1. T.O. and the Hall… It has been eight days since the Super Bowl and nine days since the Pro Football Hall of Fame vote. But with the sport settling into a bit of an offseason calm until the NFL scouting combine, a bit of reflection is in order. That means, in this case, revisiting the omission of wide receiver Terrell Owens from the Hall of Fame on the eve of Super Bowl LI.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe voters got it wrong.\\n\\nT.O. is a no-doubt-about-it Hall of Famer.\\n\\nThis isn't to attack the voters. They put in a lot of time and effort, and they are sincere in their efforts to attempt to choose the players they feel are worthy. The public perception seems to be that because the selection process falls mostly to media members, Owens is being kept out because he had a rocky relationship with the media. That's not the case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose voters who voted against Owens, it seems clear, voted against him not because of his relationship with the media but because of his relationship with his teams and teammates.\\n\\nThat is a valid topic of conversation and a valid consideration for the voters. They are right to bring it up. But they're not right to keep Owens out of the Hall of Fame because of it.\\n\\nYes, he was a diva of a wide receiver. He was, in fact, perhaps the most diva-ish of all the diva wide receivers. That point should be conceded by even the staunchest supporter of Owens for the Hall of Fame because it is merely where the conversation should begin, not where it should end.\\n\\nHe is second in NFL history in career receiving yards, behind only Jerry Rice. His overwhelming greatness in terms of production far outweighs everything else. At least it should.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLook at it this way. Running back LaDainian Tomlinson was elected by the voters nine days ago in his first year of Hall of Fame eligibility. He was regarded as a virtual lock of a choice. And indeed, he sailed through as a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\\n\\nNo argument here.\\n\\nBut Tomlinson is the fifth-leading rusher in league history. So his historical significance is slightly less than that of Owens.\\n\\nTomlinson is regarded as a great guy. Again, no argument here.\\n\\nHe played 11 seasons for the San Diego Chargers and New York Jets. He played in 10 postseason games. He never reached a Super Bowl.\\n\\nOwens played in 15 seasons for the San Francisco 49ers, Philadelphia Eagles, Dallas Cowboys, Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals. He played in a dozen postseason games, including a Super Bowl appearance with the Eagles.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo if Owens's antics really undermined his teams so much, how did those teams play that number of postseason games? How did he reach a Super Bowl?\\n\\nOwens belongs in Canton. And it doesn't matter what former players and coaches say about it. They're not the judges. The voters are supposed to be the judges.\\n\\nHe belonged last year in his first year of eligibility. He belonged this year. He continues to belong.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Owens has not appeared close thus far to advancing from modern era finalist to actual enshrinee. Those voters who are against him seem to be adamantly against him. Fellow wide receiving great Randy Moss is eligible next year, giving voters another opportunity to pass over Owens.\\n\\nThe guess here is that he eventually will be selected.\\n\\nBut if and when it happens, it will be too late.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt should have happened already.\\n\\n2. OT rule… From T.O. to OT.\\n\\nThe first overtime Super Bowl sparked some discussion about the overtime rule. The Patriots won the coin flip, got the ball first in overtime and drove to the winning touchdown. Game over. The Atlanta Falcons never got the ball.\\n\\nThat led some to contend that the overtime rule should be amended further to ensure each team of having possession of the ball at least once.\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nNo one at the game left NRG Stadium that night thinking that the Falcons hadn't had a fair chance to win. Not even the Falcons, if they were being honest with themselves.\\n\\nAll the Falcons had to do to get a possession in overtime was to hold the Patriots to a field goal. Or to no points at all. Once the Falcons failed to do that, they no longer deserved to win.\\n\\nThe overtime rule already has been amended to prevent a team from winning the coin toss, driving within shouting distance of the opposite goal line and ending the game with a field goal.\\n\\nThat's enough.\\n\\nThe rule is fair. Maybe it's not perfect. But few rules are perfect, and this one is plenty good enough.\\n\\nNo further tinkering is needed.\\n\\n3. Romo and Texans… The more you think about it, the more the Houston Texans seem like the best potential landing spot for quarterback Tony Romo.\\n\\nThere are two teams with quarterback problems and Super Bowl-ready defenses. One is the Denver Broncos. But their issues along the offensive line would be a major problem for Romo. And they have young quarterbacks Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch to develop.\\n\\nAll the Texans have is Brock Osweiler. Enough said there.\\n\\nOnce J.J. Watt returns to the already fearsome Houston defense, the Texans will be a quarterback away from having the possibility of being a special team. Romo, if he has anything left, could be the difference. Yes, Osweiler's contract is burdensome. But the Texans would be wise to at least try to make this happen.\\n\\nWould Cowboys owner Jerry Jones allow Romo to go to Houston? Perhaps. It wouldn't be ideal for Jones to have Romo land elsewhere in the state. But it's an AFC team. And if Jones truly wants to do right by Romo, he will send him somewhere with a chance to succeed quickly. That somewhere could be Houston.\\n\\nThen he went to California to play golf at Pebble Beach.\\n\\nSo, not to judge, but to clarify: Playing golf at Pebble Beach doesn't count as a day off?\\n\\n5. Colts' signal-stealing accusations… Deion Sanders suggested following the Super Bowl that everyone should forget about the Patriots' supposed cheating because no one talks about the Indianapolis Colts stealing signals during quarterback Peyton Manning's glory days. That led to a public response by former Colts coach Tony Dungy that yes, the team attempted to steal opponents' signals but did nothing illegal.\\n\\nDungy is completely right.\\n\\nThe Patriots weren't punished in Spygate for stealing opponents' coaching signals. They were punished for videotaping opponents' coaching signals in violation of NFL rules.\\n\\nIf the Colts of Dungy and Manning indeed stole opposing signals but did nothing illegal, such as videotaping, in doing so, there's nothing to see here.\\n\\n6. Brady's age… Brady turns 40 in August.\\n\\nWhen will he begin to show his age?\\n\\nThere's no telling.\\n\\nHe already has outlasted Manning.\\n\\nThe end came quickly, remember, for Manning. One season, he could play. The next season, suddenly, he couldn't.\\n\\nManning went from having a passer rating of 115.1 in 2013 for the Broncos at age 37 to having a passer rating of 101.5 in 2014 at 38 to having a passer rating of 67.9 in 2015 at 39. The Denver defense handed him a second career Super Bowl triumph as a going-away present and he retired following the 2015 season.\\n\\nBut Manning was undone by injuries. His body betrayed him. The neck injury that ended his Colts' tenure could have ended his career. Instead, he had a wondrous second act in Denver. But he was, essentially, on borrowed time, and finally his body no longer could withstand the rigors of playing the game.\\n\\nBrady shows no signs of being anywhere near that point. He has been remarkably durable, other than the knee injury that cost him the 2008 season.\\n\\nBrady clearly will play into his 40s. And at this point, there is no reason to doubt that he will play effectively well into his 40s.\\n\\n7. Falcons' coordinators… The Falcons have two new coordinators. They knew they'd be losing offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, who left after the Super Bowl for the head coaching job in San Francisco. Coach Dan Quinn replaced him with Steve Sarkisian.\\n\\nThe unexpected post-Super Bowl move was Quinn ousting defensive coordinator Richard Smith and promoting Marquand Manuel from secondary coach to defensive coordinator.\\n\\nYes, the Falcons ranked 25th in the league in total defense and 27th in scoring defense during the regular season. Yes, Quinn reportedly took over defensive play-calling duties during the season. And yes, the defense eventually was shredded during the Super Bowl by Brady, who threw for 466 yards.\\n\\nEven so, the moves on defense come as a surprise. The Falcons were young and fast on defense. The defense got better as the season progressed, and it gave Brady and the Patriots problems into the third quarter of the Super Bowl.\\n\\nThings unraveled from there. But the defense was not totally to blame. If Shanahan had stuck to the running game while protecting the lead in the fourth quarter, the Falcons likely would be Super Bowl champs right now and feeling quite a bit better about their defensive performance in the game.\\n\\n8. White's TD… James White came very, very close to having his knee down before the football reached the goal line on his game-winning touchdown run in overtime in the Super Bowl.\\n\\nThe celebration began immediately after an official on the field signaled touchdown, leading some to wonder if the play had been properly reviewed and confirmed by instant replay.\\n\\nIt was, according to Dean Blandino, the NFL's senior vice president of officiating.\\n\\nRemember in overtime you don't kick the extra point, Blandino said in a video posted to his Twitter account. So the officials were briefed prior to the start of the drive that: 'If we have a touchdown ruled and it's close, replay is going to stop the game immediately to review the play. We have to keep the [players and coaches on the] sidelines off the field, try to keep everybody off the field.' [It's] almost impossible in this situation.\\n\\nBut we are going to review this play if it's remotely close. . . . The runner is gonna reach the ball over the goal line. The line judge. . . he's gonna signal touchdown. Immediately the replay official is signaling to the officials on the field to stop the game to review the play. . . . The play did go under review. The referee looked at it. . . . The ruling on the field was confirmed. The play did go under review and the call was confirmed, and that's how the game ended.\\n\\n9. Niners and Shanahan… So should the Niners have had second thoughts about hiring Shanahan as their head coach following his play-calling mismanagement late in the Super Bowl?\\n\\nNo way. Shanahan earned his head coaching opportunity by overseeing the league's highest-scoring offense this season. The 49ers are a long, long way from having to worry about protecting a late lead in the Super Bowl.\\n\\nBut the next team to face Brady, Belichick and the Patriots in the Super Bowl needs to have its play-calling act together. From the Seattle Seahawks passing the ball from the 1-yard line instead of handing it to Marshawn Lynch to the Falcons failing to run the ball on two key fourth-quarter plays, Patriots' opponents keep helping them to Super Bowl triumphs.\\n\\nThey don't need the help. That should be obvious by now.\\n\\n10. Waiting for the combine… The NFL scouting combine begins Feb. 28 and runs through March 6.\\n\\nThat is later than usual, meaning there is a longer-than-usual break between the Super Bowl and the combine."}
{"original": "Last October, Roy was the most prominent Republican calling for the resignation of Texas's hard-right attorney general, Ken Paxton, amid allegations of bribery. His denunciation was made all the more remarkable by the fact that Roy used to be Paxton's top aide.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut not even those moves went as deeply against the Trump-era grain as Roy's latest maneuvers. While most House Republicans appear to be positioning themselves to mount a futile and deeply undemocratic challenge Wednesday to Joe Biden's clear electoral victory in the 2020 presidential contest, Roy is leading a small band of conservatives who are calling them out.\\n\\nRoy, leading a half-dozen others, released a statement Sunday declaring that, President Trump's temper tantrums and the GOP's own disappointment notwithstanding, lawmakers have no choice but to accept the electoral college results that have been certified by the states: The text of the Constitution is clear. States select electors. Congress does not. Accordingly, our path forward is also clear. We must respect the states' authority here. Though doing so may frustrate our immediate political objectives, we have sworn an oath to promote the Constitution above our policy goals.\\n\\nThat same day, which was swearing-in day for the new Congress, Roy went one gutsy step further. He challenged the seating of 67 House members from the six states where Trump has claimed, without evidence, that victory was stolen from him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe U.S. is more politically polarized than ever. The Post's Kate Woodsome asks experts what drives political sectarianism — and what we can do about it. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nRoy's logic: If the presidential result was tainted, so was the outcome of those House races, which employed the same ballot procedures, signature validations, and judgments by state executive and judicial branch officials.\\n\\nThe gambit, unsurprisingly, failed. But it forced a vote that highlighted the hypocrisy and political opportunism of Roy's fellow Republicans, all but two of whom voted to seat the members. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), for whom Roy once served as chief of staff, is stoking his 2024 presidential hopes by helping to lead a dishonest drive to question the electoral college results.\\n\\nDo not be confused: Roy has been among the staunchest supporters and admirers of the president, and remains so. It is hard to see any political upside to his principled stand. He may have invited a primary challenge that could put the squeeze on him in a rapidly growing Central Texas district that Democrats already see as a prime pickup opportunity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut he, and a few others like him, are worth watching in the months and years ahead as Republicans try to figure out how to navigate the post-Trump era.\\n\\nWhether Trump leaves the White House on his own or has to be dragged out of the building by federal agents, Republicans are going to have to come to terms with the shambles that they and he have made of their supposedly conservative values.\\n\\nThe only dogmas they recognize anymore are the impulses and lies of a president who stands on no discernible principle beyond self-interest.\\n\\nAs Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), another conservative who has stood against the herd, put it: The Founders entrusted our elections chiefly to the states — not Congress. They entrusted the election of our president to the people, acting through the Electoral College — not Congress. And they entrusted the adjudication of election disputes to the courts — not Congress. Under the Constitution and federal law, Congress's power is limited to counting electoral votes submitted by the states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd there is another factor. With their radical disregard for democracy, Republicans are writing a playbook for any future presidential candidate — say, a Democrat who loses an election that was actually close — to actually succeed in overturning a valid result.\\n\\nIn their statement, Roy and his fellow Freedom Caucus members noted that the GOP's presidential nominee has won the popular vote only once in the past 32 years: If we perpetuate the notion that Congress may disregard certified electoral votes — based solely on its own assessment that one or more states mishandled the presidential election — we will be delegitimizing the very system that led Donald Trump to victory in 2016, and that could provide the only path to victory in 2024.\\n\\nThat is another way of saying that the fealty Trump has demanded comes with a high price — one that Republicans could be paying long after he is gone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSign up to receive my columns in your inbox as soon as they're published.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "House Democrats have named lowering drug one of their priorities, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promising last week to lower health costs and prescription drug prices. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the newly minted GOP chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has vowed to crack down on the shenanigans played by major drugmakers to limit lower-priced alternative medicines.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are signals the industry's influence is waning, after it recently failed in its bid to reverse steeper payments for drugs in Medicare's so-called doughnut hole, the coverage gap for seniors. And overlaying all of this are surprisingly aggressive efforts by the Trump administration to lower prescription drug costs in the Medicare program, some of which were outlined in its drug pricing blueprint.\\n\\nI'm very optimistic that the long overdue effort to rein in the price gouging from PhRMA is underway, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) who is seen as a leader on the issue, told me on Friday.\\n\\nMembers are eyeing at least two bills with bipartisan support: The Creates Act, which would prevent branded drugmakers from guarding their medications so other companies can't develop alternatives; and legislation to prohibit pay-for-delay deals in which drugmakers pay producers of generic medicines to delay introduction of cheaper versions of them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese measures attempt to introduce more competition among drugmakers by leveling the playing field — an approach some in theTrump administration (including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb) favor even as they remain suspicious of approaches that smack of government price-fixing. As for Democrats, they'd like the government to play a much more robust role in the prescription drug pricing business, but many feel they shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\\n\\nI think it would be a shame … to waste an opportunity if President Trump is willing to work on this issue — or have his people work on this issue — to actually get something done, said former congressman Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California who served as chairman and then ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\\n\\nEnding pay-for-delay tactics is a priority for Grassley, who has teamed up with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) on their Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act. The legislation, which would prohibit the deals for generics, would inject a healthy dose of Midwestern, common-sense medicine into Big Pharma, Grassley said in a November floor speech.\\n\\nGrassley has also signed on to the Creates Act, whose House and Senate versions are supported by a broad range of lawmakers — so broad, in fact, that they included both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly beat Cruz in the November midterms. The measure would allow generic companies to sue branded companies for failing to provide them with samples needed to create generic versions of their products (we explained the Creates Act more in this Health 202).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOf course, the partial government shutdown now in its third week is consuming all the oxygen in the room right now. But advocates say they're still betting lawmakers will come together on an issue that troubles 80 percent of Americans.\\n\\nI am way more optimistic than we've ever been before, said Ellen Albritton, a senior policy analyst at Families USA. I think a lot of things are aligning in a way that they haven't aligned before.\\n\\nThe industry isn't appearing to back down, either. More than three dozen drugmakers began the new year by hiking their product prices an average of 6.3 percent, the Wall Street Journal's Jared S. Hopkins has reported, although he noted many of the hikes were relatively modest amid pressure on the issue.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump tweeted this over the weekend, following the report:\\n\\nThe Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing launched a new website yesterday to help convince lawmakers to take on high drug prices. Members of Congress ran and won on the promise to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower drug prices. Our goal with this new website is to provide lawmakers with the information they need to turn their campaign promises into substantive action, said Lauren Blair, CSRxP communications director.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump administration has several drug pricing efforts in the works, mostly centered on tweaking the way the government pays for drugs in the Medicare program. But it's been bold enough to have won some respect — if begrudging — from some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress, including Welch.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are promising signs out of the Trump administration, Welch said. I think there is a significant potential Trump is going to step up on prescription drug pricing.\\n\\nYet politics remain in play. House Democrats certainly aren't ignoring the 2020 election, which could of course hand them the White House and open the door wider for pushing priorities Republicans don't favor.\\n\\nConsequently, there's talk in the caucus of passing legislation allowing the federal government to directly negotiate lower prices with drugmakers in the Medicare Part D program — a pie-in-the-sky dream for liberals that is strongly opposed by conservatives. It would be mostly a messaging tactic for Democrats, as it would almost certainly die in the Senate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, Democrats point to the huge support among their own members for the idea. Several Democrats have offered bills requiring Medicare price negotiations, but the most popular — offered by Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) — has 104 co-sponsors. Welch said he holds out hope Trump would sign such a measure (assuming Democrats could somehow get it through the Senate), given the support he expressed on the campaign trail.\\n\\nA spokesman for House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) also pointed to Medicare price negotiations, as well as the more likely efforts to lift barriers to generic drugs. He is hopeful that Democrats can work with the president in a bipartisan way, spokesman C.J. Young said.\\n\\nAHH, OOF and OUCH\\n\\nAHH: This year, there will be more female CEOs than men named Michael giving corporate presentations at the year's biggest biotech conference, Stat News reports. Last year, the website had noted there were more Michaels presenting than women at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.\\n\\nThe tables have turned: At next week's confab, there will be 33 female CEOs presenting corporate updates, compared to 19 men named Michael, Rebecca Robbins writes. And yet women will still be massively outnumbered on one of biotech's biggest stages: Men represent 90 percent of the 553 executives who will give corporate presentations at JPM. That's down from 94 percent last year.\\n\\nOOF: Insurers have pocketed more than $9 billion in taxpayer funds by overestimating their annual costs for Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, the Wall Street Journal's Joseph Walker and Christopher Weaver report. Mysterious Medicare payment rules, and the resulting payment discrepancies, are examples of how the secrecy of the $3.5 trillion U.S. health-care system promotes and obscures higher spending, the pair write in this investigation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere's how the system works: Insurers like CVS Health Corp., UnitedHealth Group and Humana submit estimates of how much providing Medicare's prescription drug benefit will cost them, and Medicare in turn uses that estimate to make payments to the insurers.\\n\\nAfter the year ends, Medicare compares the plans' bids to the actual spending. If the insurer overestimated its costs, it pockets a chunk of the extra money it received from Medicare—sometimes all of it—and this can often translate into more profit for the insurer, in addition to the profit built into the approved bid, Joseph and Christopher write. If the extra money is greater than 5% of the insurer's original bid, it has to pay some of it back to Medicare....A detailed analysis of the confidential industry data obtained by the Journal shows that 69% of Part D members from 2009 to 2013 were in plans that overestimated costs by at least 5% over that time.\\n\\nOUCH: The Food and Drug Administration says e-cigarette start-up Juul and Altria, the country's largest cigarette maker, are going back on their pledges to combat youth vaping, an issue that's become a critical focus for commissioner Gottlieb.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGottlieb plans to write letters to the companies to criticize them for publicly pledging to remove nicotine flavor pods from store shelves, while secretly negotiating a financial partnership that seems to do the opposite, the New York Times's Sheila Kaplan reports. The commissioner also wants the companies leaders to come to the agency to explain their plans.\\n\\nDespite making promises to help address youth vaping, Sheila writes the FDA is worried the December agreement Altria made to purchase 35 percent of Juul will expand the reach of the very pod-based products it said it would stop selling until the youth vaping problem was addressed.\\n\\nTRUMP TEMPERATURE\\n\\nThe partial government shutdown is dragging into its third week, and while no progress seems to have been made in negotiations, Trump administration officials have begun taking new steps to contain the fallout, our Post colleagues Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report. Meanwhile, various federal agencies and health programs have been impacted by the stalemate:\\n\\nAD\\n\\n— For 38 million low-income Americans, the shutdown could mean severe food stamp reductions if it stretches on. The SNAP program is rare among federal initiatives because it requires annual funding from Congress, even though its existence is automatically renewed, our Post colleagues Damian Paletta and Erica Werner report. Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, and the program's emergency reserves would not cover even two-thirds of February's payments, according to past disbursements. A disruption of the program impacts not only the families who receive food stamps but the retailers where that money is spent, our colleagues add. An Agriculture Department spokesman said the administration is looking at options amid the halt.\\n\\n— For the FDA, the shutdown means the agency hasn't been able to accept some new applications for drugs or medical devices. Those applications that require user fee payments could not be accepted because it can't accept new FY2019 user fees without an appropriations bill for FY2019, Commissioner Gottlieb explained in series of tweets last week. But the agency can accept new regulatory submissions that don't require a fee. Stat's Ike Swetlitz and Erin Mershon also reported last month the shutdown would not stop the agency from recalling harmful food and drugs but would slow the process for drug approvals as well as some administrative actions.\\n\\n— In Indian Country, the shutdown has meant critical funding hasn't arrived to keep health clinics running. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory, the New York Times's Mitch Smith and Julie Turkewitz write. But that means a government shutdown can largely sideline a tribe's basic functions.\\n\\n— Not all agencies have halted work. While many federal scientists across the country have been affected by stalled funding and the inability to continue research, the New York Times's Alan Blinder points out the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health were entirely or mostly funded through other legislation.\\n\\nHEALTH ON THE HILL\\n\\n—One day after retaking the majority in the House, Democratic lawmakers took an initial step toward intervening in a case in which U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.\\n\\nAs part of a rules package for the new Congress, the party voted to granted itself the authority to intervene in the lawsuit, and scheduled a vote for this week designed to force GOP lawmakers into a political corner: agree to defend a law many members have spent years reviling or appear to oppose popular ACA protections for millions of Americans with preexisting medical conditions that many have pledged to uphold, our Post colleague Amy Goldstein reports.\\n\\nThe move came hours after California Attorney General Xavier Becerra led a coalition of 17 Democratic state AGs in filing an appeal to challenge the district court's ruling.\\n\\nIt's a move that could bring the health-care law all the way to the Supreme Court for a third time, Amy writes.\\n\\nThis shouldn't be a debate; the ACA has been the law for nearly a decade and is the backbone of our health-care system, Becerra said during a call with reporters last week. This case impacts nearly every American — workers covered by employers, families, women, children, young adults, and seniors — so we will lead the ACA's defense as long and far as it takes.\\n\\nColorado Attorney General-elect Phil Weiser called the decision mind boggling and said it goes against the role of government to protect people. I just can't begin to express the magnitude of what a threat that is to the rule of law.\\n\\n— For the first time, House Democrats are planning to hold hearings on Medicare for all, a step that comes as Pelosi has backed the process, as our Post colleague Dave Weigel reports.\\n\\nWorking toward a version of universal health care has been a Democratic goal for decades. But it seemed to pick up some momentum after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pushed for Medicare for all during his presidential campaign in 2016. The next year, House Democrats cosponsored H.R. 676, a Medicare for all bill.\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the House sponsor of the legislation, called it a huge step forward to have Pelosi's support. We have to push on the inside while continuing to build support for this on the outside.\\n\\nWith Democrats locked out of power in the Senate and the White House, Jayapal said supporters of universal health care were proceeding 'one step at a time' and that getting the first real hearings on the bill — for years, it has been aspirational, and not even subject to a Congressional Budget Office score — would force a larger discussion, Dave writes.\\n\\n— House lawmakers are planning to introduce a bipartisan gun-control measure on Tuesday, an effort led by Pelosi, Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), and Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.).\\n\\nThe proposal will call for universal background checks for firearm purchases and transfers, our colleague Karoun Demirjian reports.\\n\\nHouse Democrats promised to tackle the issue of gun control with their new majority. The new Democrat-controlled House will almost certainly be able to muster the votes to pass a gun-control measure that expands background checks, Karoun writes. The measure may even pull along some Republican support. … But it remains unclear whether such legislation could clear procedural hurdles in the Senate, which remains under Republican control. The closest that the Senate has come to passing gun-control legislation expanding background checks was in 2013, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, when 56 senators rallied behind a measure — four votes shy of what they needed to clear procedural hurdles.\\n\\nAGENCY ALERT\\n\\n— Politico's Dan Diamond spoke with Chris Meekins, who left HHS last week after helping oversee migrant family reunifications. Meekins called the family separation policy headed by the Department of Homeland Security an ill-fated policy that was devised by Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller. I think that it's unconscionable to do it in this way, Meekins said. Listen to the podcast here.\\n\\n— In the final snapshot released by CMS, the agency revealed enrollment on the federal health care exchange this season fell nearly 4 percent overall from last year's sign-up period. A total of 8.4 million people signed up or were automatically enrolled in health plans for 2019 on Healthcare.gov, compared with 8.7 million who were signed up during last year's open enrollment.\\n\\nThe final numbers don't include sign-up rates for states that have their own insurance exchange and many of those states have sign-up periods that extend into mid-January. CMS said it would release additional data, including information from those state-based exchanges, in March.\\n\\n— Mary Mayhew, the Trump administration's Medicaid director, resigned from her post last week after less than three months on the job. Mayhew, who was tapped in October to be the director of the Center for Medicaid and CHIP Services, will now run Florida's health-care agency, the Miami Herald's Elizabeth Koh reports. Before her stint in the Trump administration, Mayhew served for seven years as the health and human services commissioner under Maine's former Republican governor Paul LePage.\\n\\nMayhew, long a critic of expansion under the ACA, was praised by CMS administrator Seema Verma in a Friday statement. I am excited for Mary as she transitions to serve Governor-elect DeSantis and the people of Florida, Verma said. I appreciate her efforts at CMS and I look forward to continuing to work with her as she uses her many talents to help the state of Florida create a healthcare system that serves the needs of its citizens.\\n\\n— James Carroll was confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday to lead the Office of National Drug Control Policy after leading the office in an acting capacity since February. The White House had gone without a permanent drug czar since nearly the beginning of the Trump administration.\\n\\n— ICYMI: The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized in late December its overhaul of Medicare's so-called Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) program — and the agency followed through on stricter rules that could expose these health savings cooperatives to losses sooner. The Health 202 detailed the proposed new rules here.\\n\\n— Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie, who has been the subject of multiple reports about his previous affiliation with Confederate groups, failed to disclose that affiliation to the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee during his confirmation process, CNN's Andrew Kaczynski reports.\\n\\nOur Post colleagues Lisa Rein and Paul Sonne have reported Wilkie built his career working alongside polarizing figures and was once a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that defends Confederate symbols. CNN's Andrew, Nathan McDermott and Chris Massie also reported Wilkie has given a speech to the group. Wilkie was required to disclose in a sworn statement submitted to the Senate committee his public statements, published materials and memberships he held in organizations over the past decade, Andrew writes. Wilkie, however, did not disclose any of his ties to Confederate groups.\\n\\nSTATE SCAN\\n\\n— In Maine, new Gov. Janet Mills issued an executive order to move forward with expanding Medicaid in the state, fulfilling a campaign promise to make doing so her first priority, the Associated Press's Marina Villenueve reports.\\n\\nThe Democrat called for expedited approval of benefits to 70,000 additional low-income residents in the state and called for the state's health agency to work with lawmakers to find a way to fund the expanded program. The plan still needs to be approved by federal regulators.\\n\\n— In California, the soon-to-be-sworn-in Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom is expected to introduce an ambitious leave policy that would give families six months of paid leave after a child is born, which would be the longest in the country.\\n\\nNewsom is set to propose the policy and include it in his budget after his swearing in on Monday, the New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Jim Tankersley report. But what's missing in the Democrat's policy is a plan to fund it. It's the same challenge that has stymied the policy at the federal level, Claire and Jim write. Around 80 percent of Americans consistently say they support paid parental leave, and some Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in embracing the idea. Yet federal lawmakers have declined to pass tax increases or corporate mandates to make it a reality.\\n\\nNewsom's plan comes as other state's are looking to move forward with state-based plans instead of waiting for the federal government. Massachusetts, Washington and New Jersey have new or recently expanded policies on the books, and Jim and Claire report Oregon, Colorado and Connecticut are poised to follow. Still, Newsom's proposal for California would be the most generous.\\n\\n— And here are a few more good reads from The Post and beyond:\\n\\nMEDICAL MISSIVES\\n\\nINDUSTRY RX\\n\\nREPRODUCTIVE WARS\\n\\nDAYBOOK\\n\\nToday\\n\\nThe 37th annual J.P.

All executive directives, orders, and regulations inconsistent with this order, including but not limited to those issued to or by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from September 11, 2001, to January 20, 2009, concerning detention or the interrogation of detained individuals, are revoked to the extent of their inconsistency with this order. . . .

And in a broad swipe at the Bush administration's lawyers, Obama nullified every legal order and opinion on interrogations issued by any lawyer in the executive branch after Sept. 11, 2001.\\n\\nJames Gordon Meek writes for the New York Daily News: President Obama has rolled back Team Bush's torture policies with a bang, not a whimper, issuing four executive orders in a sweeping repudiation of his predecessor's 'war on terror.' . . .\\n\\nOne of the war's most successful interrogators cheered Obama.\\n\\n'It's a significant step toward saving American lives,' said Air Force Reserve Maj. Matthew Alexander - the lead interrogator of terrorists who betrayed Al Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi before his 2006 killing.\\n\\n'When I was in Iraq, the No. 1 reason foreign fighters said they were coming into the country to fight was Abu Ghraib,' said Alexander, author of 'How To Break A Terrorist.'\\n\\nThere's still some work to be done, however.\\n\\n\\n\\nScott Shane, Mark Mazzetti and Helene Cooper write in the New York Times: Mr. Obama's orders struck a powerful new tone and represented an important first step toward rewriting American rules for dealing with terrorism suspects. But only his decision to halt for now the military trials under way at Guantánamo Bay seemed likely to have immediate practical significance, with other critical policy choices to be resolved by task forces set up within the administration.\\n\\nAmong the questions that the White House did not resolve on Thursday were these: What should be done with terrorists who cannot be tried in American courts, either because evidence against them was obtained by torture or because intelligence is too sensitive to use in court? Should some interrogation methods remain secret to keep Al Qaeda from training to resist them? How can the United States make sure prisoners transferred to other countries will not be tortured?\\n\\nJoby Warrick and Karen DeYoung write in The Washington Post: Senior administration officials indicated that the military commissions established by the previous administration to try prisoners at Guantanamo Bay -- whose operations were suspended by Obama on Wednesday -- might be preserved in some form for those detainees determined to be 'unreleasable' and 'untriable.'\\n\\nThe orders did not prohibit renditions, in which the CIA has secretly transferred prisoners captured in one country to another without trial. Although they mandated that the CIA adhere to interrogation guidelines used by the military, officials said that a separate 'protocol' may still be established to govern intelligence agency interrogation practices.\\n\\nThose issues and others are to be reviewed by a Cabinet-level task force that will study how to deal with the most vexing legacies of the Bush administration's detention program, Obama said.\\n\\nAnd Greg Miller and Julian E. Barnes write in the Los Angeles Times that Obama appeared to leave an opening for the CIA to once again go beyond the 19 approved techniques listed in the Army field manual. The order calls for the creation of a special task force, headed by the U.S. attorney general, to study whether the Army field manual is adequate and to recommend 'additional or different guidance for other departments or agencies.'\\n\\nAdministration officials emphasized that there was no intent to create a loophole.\\n\\n'This is not a secret annex that allows us to bring the enhanced interrogation techniques back,' said a senior Obama administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing legal strategies. 'It's not.'\\n\\nBut the language left the impression that the Obama team could later decide to adopt separate standards for the military and the CIA, and that any additional methods approved for the agency would remain classified.\\n\\nRetired Navy Adm. Dennis C. Blair, the president's nominee to serve as the next director of national intelligence, testified Thursday that the government would withhold specifics from any new interrogation document for fear that 'we not turn our manual into a training manual for our adversaries.'\\n\\nIt sounds to me like the Obama White House needs to state even more categorically that it will not under any circumstances approve interrogation techniques that violate the Geneva Conventions -- and it needs to do so on the record. A background briefing won't cut it -- even when a public schedule and multiple references by Press Secretary Robert Gibbs to Greg in his press briefing makes it clear that the briefers were White House Counsel Greg Craig and Deputy White House Counsel Mary DeRosa.\\n\\nThat said, torture opponents are happy.\\n\\nFrank Jordans writes for the Associated Press: Former detainees, human-rights advocates and government officials around the world welcomed President Barack Obama's decision to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center, saying Thursday it helped restore their faith in the United States.\\n\\nSpencer Ackerman writes in the Washington Independent that civil libertarians and ex-CIA officials involved in interrogations and detentions policies hailed the changes. . . .\\n\\nLinda Gustitus, president of the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, said Obama 'has already changed the world with respect to America's use of torture.' Kate Martin of the Center for National Security Studies said the orders represented an 'extraordinary first step towards ending the illegalities and abuses of the last seven years.' Jennifer Daskal, senior counterterrorism counsel for Human Rights Watch, said the interrogations order 'makes meaningful the US commitment not to torture detainees' and that 'President Obama has rejected the abusive practices of the last seven-and-a-half years.' Caroline Fredrickson, Washington director of the ACLU, said Obama had given the U.S. 'a much-needed and significant break from the Bush administration policies that, with utter disregard for our Constitution, trampled our nation's values and ideals.'\\n\\nAnn Woolner writes in her Bloomberg opinion column: In these orders, Obama declared an end to some of the darkest events of the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld administration and began the long, difficult task of restoring American ideals of humanity.\\n\\nI am beginning to recognize my country again.\\n\\nEugene Robinson writes in his Washington Post opinion column: The executive orders that Obama signed yesterday concerning the detention of terrorism suspects are a beginning. Much more remains to be undone. . . .\\n\\nWe don't know the full story of the secret offshore CIA prisons where terrorism suspects were held and interrogated. We don't know the extent of the 'rendition' program in which suspects were handed over to cooperative third countries for aggressive and reportedly abusive questioning. We don't know the full extent of the administration's warrantless domestic electronic surveillance.\\n\\nThe Los Angeles Times editorial board writes: With executive orders signed Thursday, President Obama has begun the rehabilitation of this country's reputation when it comes to the treatment of suspected terrorists. But the orders contain ambiguities that demonstrate how hard it will be to unwind the tangle that President Bush created.\\n\\nThe pushback from Bush apologists started even before Obama signed the orders.\\n\\nIn a Washington Post op-ed yesterday, former Bush speechwriter Marc A. Thiessen made the outrageous and unsupported charge that banning Bush's enhanced interrogation techniques would effectively kill a program that stopped al-Qaeda from launching another Sept. 11-style attack.\\n\\nWrote Thiessen: Information gained using those techniques is responsible for stopping a number of planned attacks -- including plots to blow up the American consulate in Karachi, Pakistan; to fly airplanes into the towers of Canary Wharf in London; and to fly a hijacked airplane into the Library Tower in Los Angeles.\\n\\nBut as I've repeatedly noted, it's never been proven that any of these attacks were anything more than a fantasy, nor that they were averted due to CIA interrogation.\\n\\nThiessen was at it again today on the National Review Web site: The CIA program he is effectively shutting down is the reason why America has not been attacked again after 9/11. He has removed the tool that is singularly responsible for stopping al-Qaeda from flying planes into the Library Tower in Los Angeles, Heathrow Airport, and London's Canary Warf, and blowing up apartment buildings in Chicago, among other plots. It's not even the end of inauguration week, and Obama is already proving to be the most dangerous man ever to occupy the Oval Office.\\n\\nBut Thiessen is making this stuff up, people. I'm guessing the new addition to his list -- the Chicago plot -- is the same one Bush mentioned in a fact sheet last month, and which as I debunked at the time. (It involved a 22-year-old American citizen who never had any weapons and was apparently goaded into threatening to bomb a shopping mall by an FBI informant.)"}

Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy at the Heartland Institute, an influential libertarian think tank in suburban Chicago that has the ear of the Trump administration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn December, Heartland headlined Naomi at its forum at the UN climate conference in Madrid, where Taylor described her as the star of the show. Last month, Heartland hired Naomi as the young face of its campaign to question the scientific consensus that human activity is causing dangerous global warming.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNaomi Seibt vs. Greta Thunberg: whom should we trust? asked Heartland in a digital video. Later this week, Naomi is set to make her American debut at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, a high-profile annual gathering just outside Washington of right-leaning activists.\\n\\nAfter taking a solar-powered boat from England to New York to attend the United Nations Climate Action Summit, Thunberg discussed what activists need to do. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nIf imitation is the highest form of flattery, Heartland's tactics amount to an acknowledgment that Greta has touched a nerve, especially among teens and young adults. Since launching her protest two years ago outside the Swedish parliament at age 15, Greta has sparked youth protests across the globe and in 2019 was named Time magazine's Person of the Year, the youngest to ever win the honor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe teenager has called on the nations of the world to cut their total carbon output by at least half over the next decade, saying that if they don't, then there will be horrible consequences.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI want you to panic, she told attendees at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. And then I want you to act.\\n\\nNaomi, for her part, argues that these predictions of dire consequences are exaggerated. In a video posted on Heartland's website, she gazes into the camera and says, I don't want you to panic. I want you to think.\\n\\nGraham Brookie directs the Digital Forensic Research Lab, an arm of the nonprofit Atlantic Council that works to identify and expose disinformation. While the campaign is not outright disinformation, Brookie said in an email, it does bear resemblance to a model we use called the 4d's — dismiss the message, distort the facts, distract the audience, and express dismay at the whole thing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBrookie added: The tactic is intended to create an equivalency in spokespeople and message. In this case, it is a false equivalency between a message based in climate science that went viral organically and a message based in climate skepticism trying to catch up using paid promotion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNaomi said her political activism was sparked a few years ago when she began asking questions in school about Germany's liberal immigration policies. She said the backlash from teachers and other students hardened her skepticism about mainstream German thinking. More recently, she said that watching young people joining weekly Fridays For Future protests inspired by Greta helped spur her opposition to climate change activism.\\n\\nI get chills when I see those young people, especially at Fridays for Future. They are screaming and shouting and they're generally terrified, she said in an interview. They don't want the world to end.\\n\\nNaomi said she does not dispute that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet, but she argues that many scientists and activists have overstated their impact.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI don't want to get people to stop believing in man-made climate change, not at all, she said. Are manmade CO2 emissions having that much impact on the climate? I think that's ridiculous to believe.\\n\\nNaomi argues that other factors, such as solar energy, play a role — though the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth has actually declined since the 1970s, according to federal measurements. A slew of peer-reviewed reports, from scientific bodies in the U.S. and elsewhere, have concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are the dominant cause of warming since the mid-20th century, producing a range of devastating effects from massive marine die-offs in South America to severe wildfires in Australia and sinking ground in the Arctic.\\n\\nIn addition to climate change, Naomi echoes far-right skepticism about feminism and immigration. The German media have described her as sympathetic to the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), the biggest opposition party in parliament, whose leaders have spoken of fighting an invasion of foreigners. Naomi says she is not a member of AfD — she describes herself as libertarian — but acknowledges speaking at a recent AfD event.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHer path to Heartland began in November with a speech at EIKE, a Munich think tank whose vice president is a prominent AfD politician. By then, Naomi was already active on YouTube, producing videos on topics ranging from migration to feminism to climate change. In the audience was Heartland's Taylor. He said he immediately recognized her potential and approached her about working with Heartland.\\n\\nFounded in 1984 and funded largely by anonymous donors, Heartland has increasingly focused on climate change over the past decade. Its staff and researchers enjoy ready access to the Trump administration, and one of its senior fellows, William Happer, served as a senior director on the White House National Security Council between September 2018 and 2019.\\n\\nAn emeritus professor of physics at Princeton University, Happer has repeatedly argued that carbon emissions should be viewed as beneficial to society — not a pollutant that drives global warming. During his time with the Trump administration, he sought to enlist Heartland's help in promoting his ideas and objected to a U.S. intelligence official's finding that climate impacts could be possibly catastrophic, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhy would an American think tank want to get involved in German politics? Because it worries that Berlin's strong stance on reducing greenhouse-gas emissions could be contagious, according to a recent investigation aired on German television.\\n\\nFor two decades, Germany has been a leader in pressing other nations to curb carbon output and shift to renewable energy. Though it is falling short of its ambitious goals, Germany has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions this year by 40 percent compared to 1990 — and by up to 95 percent by mid-century.\\n\\nIn December, during the Madrid climate conference, two undercover staffers from the nonprofit investigative newsroom CORRECTIV approached Taylor and claimed to work for a wealthy donor from the auto industry who wanted to give Heartland a half-million euros. Taylor took the bait, and followed up with a three-page proposal outlining a campaign to push back against German efforts to regulate emissions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese restrictive environmental programs are largely unnecessary, says the document, a copy of which was obtained by The Post. Worse, other nations — including the United States and European Union nations — are increasingly being influenced by unwise German policy.\\n\\nThe proposal described Naomi as the star of a Climate Reality Forum organized by Heartland during the Madrid talks. With over 100,000 people viewing her talk on climate realism, the proposal said, Naomi was well-positioned to fight German climate policies.\\n\\nFunding for our Germany Environmental Issues project will enable Heartland to provide Naomi with the equipment and the sources she needs to present a series of effective videos calling attention to the negative impacts of overreaching environmental regulations, the proposal says.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCORRECTIV aired its report on Heartland earlier this month on German TV. Taylor dismissed the report, saying, Heck, I would have spoken with them if they told us who they were, and the answers would have been pretty much the same.\\n\\nThe investigators filmed Naomi at a public event, posing as would-be donors. She struck back with her own video response. Invoking Greta, she said, To the media, I have a few last words: How dare you?\\n\\nDespite echoes of Greta's style, Naomi has objected to the comparison.\\n\\nThe reason I don't like the term anti-Greta is that it suggests I myself am an indoctrinated puppet, I guess, for the other side, she says in one video. Asked if she meant that as a criticism of Greta, Naomi says: That sounds kind of mean, actually. She added: I don't want to shame her in any way.\\n\\nTaylor said the tendency to associate Naomi with Greta is kind of natural — and benefits Heartland's message.\\n\\nTo the extent that Naomi is pretty much the same, just with a different perspective, yeah, I think that it's good that people will look at the two as similar in many ways, he said.\\n\\nStill, Naomi has a long climb to reach the level of global attention lavished on Greta. While Greta measures her social media following in the millions, Naomi counts slightly under 50,000 YouTube subscribers."}

We initiated a record number of administrative actions; the government collected record-setting civil penalties.\\n\\nUnder the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, drug companies are required to report unusually large or otherwise suspicious orders. Failure to do so can result in fines and the suspension or loss of DEA registrations to manufacture or distribute narcotics.\\n\\nWhen the DEA suspected that a company was ignoring suspicious sales, the agency filed an order to show cause. That gave a company at least 30 days to explain why the agency should not revoke its registration.\\n\\nIn the most egregious cases, the DEA employed an immediate suspension order, allowing the agency to lock up a distributor's drugs. The orders instantly halted all commerce in controlled substances on the grounds that the drugs constituted an imminent danger to the community.\\n\\nUnder Rannazzisi in the mid-2000s, the DEA repeatedly warned the companies that they were shipping unusually large volumes of opioids to customers around the country. Despite the warnings, some companies continued the shipments.\\n\\nThe DEA soon began bringing enforcement actions against distributors. In 2007, the agency moved against McKesson, the nation's largest drug distributor and the fifth-largest corporation in the nation, for failing to report hundreds of suspicious orders placed by Internet pharmacies.

Any claim that he tried to steamroll DEA or would ever seek to steamroll DEA is simply incorrect.\\n\\nA Nov. 30 email from Tyson, the Justice Department congressional liaison officer, to a Senate staffer shows that the DEA agreed to the bill with reluctance.\\n\\nDEA felt this wasn't a great solution, but was the best of the options offered to us, even if it did not fully address the concerns we had previously laid out for you, she added, according to the email, which was provided by staff of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), one of the bill's co-sponsors.\\n\\nThe bill would also give drug companies the opportunity to submit corrective action plans — outlines of how they were going to fix problems — before the DEA could sanction them. The DEA would be required to consider those plans before imposing penalties.\\n\\nThe Marino bill's path to passage How the bill that weakened the DEA made it through Congress and onto President Obama's desk. Congress DEA/DOJ Lobby Industry Rep. Tom Marino introduces the first version of the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act. After a hearing, the bill stalls in committee. Marino asks then Attorney General Eric H. Holder to meet with the drug companies. An email from a Justice legislative affairs officer says that the Marino bill was written by Barber. After Marino introduces a third version his bill, Congress holds a hearing. Barber is the featured witness testifying in favor of the legislation. Sen. Orrin Hatch introduces the measure in the Senate. DEA and Justice negotiate with Hatch's staff on language in the bill. The bill passes in the Senate. The bill passes in the House President Obama signs the bill into law. Open full timeline\\n\\nOn March 17, 2016, the Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. On April 12, the House approved the Senate version, also by unanimous consent.\\n\\nThe bill still needed the president's signature. Opposition from the DEA or Justice could derail it, but the two agencies had given up the fight.\\n\\nThe senior DEA official said the agency worked with Congress to improve the bill under difficult political circumstances. The agency believed earlier versions of the bill would have forced it to meet a criminal standard before issuing immediate suspension orders. The original version of the bill was unworkable, the official said.\\n\\nThe congressional affairs office at the Justice Department told the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy that it no longer objected to the bill, according to Botticelli, then chief of the office.\\n\\nOn April 19, Obama signed the bill. The White House issued a one-page news release announcing its enactment.\\n\\nMarino also issued a release taking credit for the legislation.\\n\\nWith this law, our drug enforcement agencies will have the necessary tools to address the issue of prescription drug abuse across the country. I applaud the hard work of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Congress and President Obama for realizing the importance of this legislation.\\n\\nIndustry groups also thanked Obama. They agreed to work with the DEA to ensure that the law is implemented efficiently and effectively, said John M. Gray, chief executive of the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, which represents the nation's drug distribution companies.\\n\\nTwo months after Obama signed the bill, Rosenberg appeared on Capitol Hill. Hatch praised him.\\n\\nI've been told the DEA's relationship with supply chain stakeholders has improved since you've taken the helm at DEA, the senator said. I want to just say I applaud your efforts on this front.\\n\\nHe then asked Rosenberg how he viewed the relationship between the DEA and the opioid industry going forward.\\n\\nRosenberg said the agency had been slow to address industry's concerns and had failed to communicate with them.\\n\\nThe overwhelming majority, 99 plus percent, are our allies in this thing, Rosenberg said.\\n\\nIllustration by Eddie Alvarez/The Washington Post; Photo from iStock\\n\\n(Illustration by Eddie Alvarez/The Washington Post; iStock photo)\\n\\nEpilogue\\n\\n2016: 197,713 deaths from prescription opioid overdoses since 2000.\\n\\nJohn Mulrooney,DEA Chief Administrative Law Judge John J.

That number has dropped from 65 in fiscal year 2011 to six so far this fiscal year, according to the DEA. Not a single order has targeted a distributor or manufacturer since late 2015, according to Mulrooney's reports, which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.\\n\\nMulrooney said in his reports that the judges under him were handling so few cases at the DEA that they began hearing the cases of other federal agencies.\\n\\nIn his article planned for the winter issue of the Marquette Law Review, Mulrooney wrote: If it had been the intent of Congress to completely eliminate the DEA's ability to ever impose an immediate suspension on distributors or manufacturers, it would be difficult to conceive of a more effective vehicle for achieving that goal.\\n\\nMulrooney's article also criticized the law for allowing companies to submit corrective action plans before the DEA could sanction them.\\n\\nHe likened that provision to allowing bank robbers to round up and return ink-stained money and agree not to rob any more banks.\\n\\nThe DEA said in a statement last week that it is still pursuing reckless doctors and rogue businesses with a wide variety of tools.\\n\\nWe will continue fighting the opioid crisis and continue to use all the tools at our disposal to combat this epidemic, the statement said.\\n\\nSince the DEA started to crack down on the opioid industry a decade ago, pharmaceutical companies and the law firms that represent them have hired at least 46 DEA officials — 32 of them directly from the division.

Murphy said he had heard the same thing from drug dealers, but the heroin and cocaine traffickers didn't have a class ring on their finger from a prestigious university. (Katye Martens Brier/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nI feel guilty, Murphy said in a recent interview. Because every day a lot of people die of an opioid-heroin overdose. Whether it's a pill or heroin, people die every day because of it. And it shouldn't be happening.\\n\\nOne of the most recent departures was Jason Hadges, the senior DEA attorney overseeing pharmaceutical enforcement cases who, according to former agency supervisors and lawyers, had been demanding a higher standard of proof on cases. Hadges left the DEA in May to join the pharmaceutical and biotechnology regulatory division of Hogan Lovells, a high-powered D.C. law firm.

All we were looking for is a good-faith effort by these companies to do the right thing, and there was no good-faith effort. Greed always trumped compliance. It did every time. It was about money, and it's as simple as that.\\n\\nJust before Geldhof left, his two-year quest to persuade the DEA to take action against Miami-Luken finally paid off. In November 2015, the DEA accused the company of multiple violations of the law for allegedly failing to report orders for tens of millions of pain pills from pharmacies, most of them in West Virginia. That case — the most recent one to target a distributor — is pending.\\n\\nOf the millions of pills sent to Mingo County, many went to one pharmacy in Williamson, the county seat, population 2,924.

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAdministration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.\\n\\nPence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.\\n\\nBut the administration — represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner — refused, according to multiple officials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNot much headway made today, Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!\\n\\nBefore the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.\\n\\nGreat support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border, Trump tweeted. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the right answer, worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list — Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) — have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.\\n\\nI've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this, Meadows said Saturday. But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term strike over shutdown, people briefed on the meeting said.\\n\\nIn conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,'  one Democratic official said. They're worried about defections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border — including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.\\n\\nDemocrats emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map, said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government in the coming week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now, Pelosi said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press that Trump would take a concrete wall off the table in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.\\n\\nIf he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction, Mulvaney said.\\n\\nBut Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.\\n\\nOn Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his Game of Thrones-style poster saying, The Wall is Coming.\\n\\nMulvaney is spearheading the Camp David gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.\\n\\nThe president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.\\n\\nAccording to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.\\n\\nStill, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.\\n\\nKushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.\\n\\nChatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now."}
{"original": "There's just one problem with all this bashing of socialism: Bolivia.\\n\\nSince 2006, Bolivia has been run by socialists every bit as militant as Venezuela's. But as economist Omar Zambrano has argued, the country has experienced a spectacular run of economic growth and poverty reduction with no hint of the chaos that has plagued Venezuela. While inflation spirals toward the thousand-percent mark in Venezuela, in Bolivia it runs below 4 percent a year. Shortages of basic consumption goods — rampant in Caracas — are unheard of in La Paz. And extreme poverty — now growing fast in Venezuela — affects just 17 percent of Bolivians now, down from 38 percent before the socialists took over 10 years ago, even as inequality shrinks dramatically. The richest 10 percent in Bolivia used to earn 128 times more than the poorest 10 percent; today, they earn 38 times as much.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow can this be? It's true that Bolivia has been on the receiving end of a staggering boom in natural resources for much of the past decade, as both the volume of its gas and mining exports and the price they fetch abroad jumped at the same time. Export revenue grew six-fold in the decade after Evo Morales, the charismatic hard-left president, took power, from $2.2 billion just before of his election to $12.9 billion at the peak of the boom.\\n\\nSo yes, that's a bit like putting the game settings on easy when it comes to development. But it can hardly explain why Bolivia thrives while Venezuela spirals: Venezuela enjoyed an even bigger commodities boom, with exports climbing from $23 billion before the oil boom to $153 billion at its peak.\\n\\nTurns out it's not the boom itself that matters, it's what you do with it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVenezuela's socialists spent the entire export windfall, and then some. Bolivia's socialists saved much of theirs.\\n\\nVenezuela ran large budget deficits every year, even as oil prices skyrocketed between 2005 to 2014. That meant the country was piling on debt even as government revenue exploded — a senseless, pro-cyclical policy that left Venezuela up a creek without a paddle when commodity prices tanked.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Bolivia was running budget surpluses every year between 2006 and 2014. This allowed it to draw down the public sector's debt, which fell from 83 percent of GDP in 2003 to just 26 percent in 2014, even as Bolivia built up its international reserves dramatically, from $1.7 billion in 2005 to $15.1 billion at the end of the boom in 2014.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTurns out the difference between Bolivia and Venezuela has nothing to do with abstract ideological labels, and everything to do with fiscal prudence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI know, I know, fiscal prudence sounds deadly dull, but it makes an enormous difference in real people's lives. While Venezuela's reckless socialists were impoverishing the country's once thriving middle class, Bolivia's socialists were creating an entirely new indigenous middle class, even spawning a whole new style of architecture along with it. Why? Because newly affluent Bolivians can afford it: Per capita GDP more than tripled from just $1,000 a year to over $3,200 over a decade. At the same time, new government social programs designed to help older people, mothers and other at-risk groups saw to major improvements in social indicators. To take just one, consider this: Thirty-two percent of Bolivians were chronically malnourished in 2003. By 2012, just 18 percent were.\\n\\nThe point here isn't to idealize Bolivia's socialists: The country remains badly governed in important ways. Corruption remains endemic in Bolivia's public sector, with most infrastructure contracts given out on a no-bid basis to ruling-party cronies. And while nowhere near as extreme as Venezuela's turn to dictatorship, Bolivia's political scene has seen worrying authoritarian drift, closing down the spaces for dissent that any proper democracy needs to function.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven the social achievements have to be taken with a grain of salt. There's a good case to be made that poverty reduction would've been faster and more sustainable if the Bolivians hadn't needlessly antagonized the private sector. As it stands, facing a sometimes hostile administration, the foreign companies that actually operate Bolivia's mines and gas fields are working aggressively to squeeze out their deposits as fast as possible and get out, investing little or nothing on risky exploration and development.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd past performance is no guarantee of future returns. Bolivia is now clearly having trouble adjusting to lower commodity prices: Since 2015 it's been running large deficits, drawing down its international reserves far too fast as the government resists the kind of spending cuts it will take to adjust to the new normal. Keep that up for another few years, and Bolivia could find itself on the same downward trajectory Venezuela is now on.\\n\\nStill, because they kept spending under control during the fat years and drew down debt, Bolivia's socialists have many more options for dealing with the lean years than Venezuela's could dream of.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat's clear is that the supposedly obvious link between socialism and economic ruin doesn't check out. It's not just that it's easy to find counter examples of socialist governments that fail to set off economic collapse, like Bolivia. It's also that catastrophe has more often than not come at the hand of committed anti-socialists. Bouts of acute economic chaos ending in hyperinflation broke out in Argentina, Brazil, Peru, and even in Bolivia itself back in the 1980s, each time under centrist or right-wing governments deeply at odds with the socialist left.\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "The difference between where families with vouchers could be living and where they actually live has long-term consequences, said researchers with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Poverty & Race Research Action Council.\\n\\nIt's going to be a wake-up call for a lot of housing authorities that their programs are quite concentrated and don't necessarily reflect where families want to live, said Philip Tegeler, president and executive director of the Poverty & Race Research Action Council. There are plenty of rental opportunities out there. It's the job of housing authorities to help remove the barriers that are keeping families from accessing these neighborhoods and communities.\\n\\nGiving low-income families the option of living in wealthier neighborhoods with better schools and less crime leads to better outcomes. Their children are more likely to go to college and find better-paying jobs, other studies have shown. They are more likely to live in better neighborhoods as adults and less likely to become single parents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut too few families with housing vouchers live in high-opportunity neighborhoods, as defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\\n\\nResearchers developed an index of opportunity using HUD measurements of school quality, poverty, labor market engagement, access to jobs, and access to public transit.\\n\\nOverall, just 5 percent of metropolitan families using vouchers live in high-opportunity neighborhoods even though those areas account for 18 percent of all affordable rentals.\\n\\nThe opportunity gap is highest in San Francisco, San Jose, and Austin.\\n\\nIn San Francisco, 18 percent of voucher-assisted families live in high-opportunity neighborhoods, even though 46 percent of affordable apartments are located there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn New York, the region with the most families using housing vouchers, only 7 percent live in neighborhoods considered to be high opportunity, even though 28 percent of affordable units are located in those communities.\\n\\nAnd in Birmingham, Ala., fewer than 1 percent of families using housing vouchers live in those neighborhoods although 13 percent of affordable units are located there. Instead, 77 percent of impoverished Birmingham families use their housing vouchers in low-opportunity neighborhoods — far exceeding the 49 percent share of affordable rentals.\\n\\nThe study also shows black and Hispanic families with vouchers are more likely than other low-income minority renters to be segregated in minority neighborhoods — although most affordable units are located outside of heavily minority neighborhoods.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n(Three of four households that qualify for federal rental assistance do not receive any aid because there is not enough money to meet everyone's needs.)\\n\\nThe finding suggests local housing voucher programs may be exacerbating residential segregation, the researchers said, and undermining the aim of the 1968 Fair Housing Act to reduce racial segregation in local jurisdictions. In Milwaukee, Birmingham and New Orleans, more than 80 percent of minority households with children use vouchers to live in minority-concentrated areas.\\n\\nIf voucher families appear to be even more segregated than similar renters of color, that signals that housing authorities need to be doing more to uphold their responsibility to the Fair Housing Act, said Alicia Mazzara, a housing analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities who co-authored the report with Brian Knudsen.\\n\\nMultiple barriers keep families from moving to better neighborhoods, researchers said, including widely varying practices and policies of regional housing agencies such as how the value of vouchers are calculated.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany low-income renters simply are not aware they could afford apartments elsewhere. Vacancy rates as well as current and historical patterns of segregation also contribute.\\n\\nAnd landlords continue to discriminate against voucher holders, according to a recent HUD study. Communities where landlords are more likely to deny renting to voucher holders also tend to have tighter rental markets and less-generous payment standards for housing vouchers.\\n\\nTegeler said housing agencies should issue vouchers that reflect the rental prices in specific Zip codes, instead of averaging across an entire metropolitan area. Providing higher government subsidies for apartments in more expensive communities — and lower subsidies for units in poor neighborhoods — would help low-income families afford apartments in more affluent neighborhoods and encourage them to move to places with better education and job opportunities, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTwo dozen metro regions, including Atlanta, Charlotte, San Diego and Honolulu, are already required to do so under an Obama-era rule that went into force in January 2017.

[They should] lose all of their money if they're cheating, because if I die in [the octagon], who's going to look after my family?\\n\\nHunt is seeking damages totaling at least Lesnar's disclosed $2.5 million purse, plus a share of the pay-per-view payout from the July 9 event, citing damage to Hunt's reputation, fight career and marketing abilities, as well as lost opportunities to engage in fair competition. Hunt is also seeking lawyers fees and other relief under the guise that the defendants committed fraud and other crimes prosecutable under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which Congress passed in 1970 to tie mafia bosses to the corrupt actions of their lower-ranked employees. The law has since been used in a more broad context, allowing individuals to sue any enterprise if they can demonstrate that enterprise has engaged in certain criminal activity.\\n\\nThe suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Nevada, alleges the UFC, Lesnar and White violated RICO by running a scheme that resulted in clean fighters unfairly facing fighters who the promotion knew were using performance-enhancing drugs. It also alleges the promotion engaged in these activities to the detriment of the health and safety of all fighters, and to the monetary benefit of [the UFC] and others involved in this scheme.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe lawsuit says UFC, Lesnar, White and others affirmatively circumvented and obstructed fair competition for their own benefit by willfully disregarding the promotion's anti-doping policy.\\n\\nDefendants have accomplished this by means including but not limited to various and rampant purported use exemptions, drug testing exemptions and by failure to enforce its own policies, states the lawsuit filed in a U.S. District Court in Nevada on Tuesday.\\n\\nHunt's case rests on the UFC's anti-doping policy, which is overseen by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. Under the policy, retired fighters are supposed to undergo four months of random drug testing before being allowed to once again compete. The UFC, however, granted an exemption for Lesnar under a clause that allows the promotion to waive the mandatory tests under exceptional circumstances.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGiven Lesnar last competed in UFC on December 30, 2011, long before the UFC Anti-Doping Policy went into effect [on July 1, 2015], for purposes of the Anti-Doping Policy, he is being treated similarly to a new athlete coming into the organization, the promotion stated (via Bloody Elbow) in June, when Lesnar announced he'd be coming back for the one-off bout.\\n\\nLesnar was later found to have failed both an out-of-competition and in-competition test for the two banned substances commonly used in conjunction with anabolic steroids.\\n\\nThe lawsuit alleges the exemption came just a month before UFC sold for more than $4 billion to Hollywood talent agency WME-IMG, and accuses UFC of wrongfully jeopardizing fighter health and safety for profit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat's corrupt s—, man, said Hunt, who made $700,000 for the UFC 200 bout. These mother——- should be penalized hard. Dirty, scummy, cheating scum.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLesnar, who agreed to pay a $250,000 fine is currently serving a one-year ban for the failed tests, was the third opponent Hunt faced that was later found to have failed a drug test.\\n\\nHunt's attorney Christina Denning said her client attempted to settle with the UFC twice before filing the lawsuit. Both times, she told The Washington Post on Wednesday, she and her client approached the UFC with deals that would provide Hunt with Lesnar's winnings and add a clause to his UFC contract that would automatically award Hunt winnings going forward should any future opponents also fail drug tests.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo put a clause like this in fighters' contracts, it's no money out of the UFC's pocket, Denning said. We're not asking them to pay anything additional, we're just asking them to include in all bout agreements a provision that says that the cheater has to forfeit to the non-cheater all of the profits. This happens in other sports.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat incentive does Brock Lesnar have not to cheat if he can have this one-off competition and walk off with [millions of dollars] if he know the precedent is to get fined a small fraction of that? Denning added. If the UFC wants to put its money where it's mouth is, this is really going to make it the world's best anti-doping program.\\n\\nUFC, which will have 30 days to reply once served, declined to comment."}

And they have begun anticipating the ire of Trump — likely to come in the form of angry tweets — in the aftermath of Wednesday's certification of the electoral college vote count before a joint session of Congress, Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey report. Pence's team views the vice president's role as procedural and limited, not unlike an umpire calling balls and strikes but ultimately hemmed in by the rules of the game. … The president's faulty belief that Pence can somehow overturn the election results is being fueled by agitators who are feeding Trump misinformation … The group includes Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal attorney; Peter Navarro, a top White House trade adviser; and Sidney Powell, a lawyer and Trump ally. Few if any legal experts agree. …\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring their weekly lunch Tuesday, Pence explicitly told Trump that he does not believe he has the authority to block the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory, according to a White House official. But Trump issued a statement later Tuesday denying the conversation. … Some advisers have proposed that Pence, while leading the Senate on Wednesday, make comments that allege irregularities while still certifying the results, in a bid to show Trump he is fighting and is supportive. …\\n\\nTwo administration officials said the president was frustrated because he thought that Pence should be doing more to publicly push his view that the election was stolen and that Pence had given up too easily. A person familiar with Trump's ire said the president largely blames Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, for the vice president's rhetorical caution. Short has told others that Pence's language about the election has been deliberately careful and that the vice president did not want to echo some of Trump's most incendiary claims.\\n\\nRepublican lawyer Cleta Mitchell, who advised Trump during his weekend call to Georgia's secretary of state, resigned as a partner in the D.C. office of law firm Foley & Lardner .

With only two weeks left in office, the administration published a rule Tuesday that spares industries and individuals from prosecution or penalties under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act if their actions, such as development or failure to cover tar pits, results in bird deaths.

{"original": "When she applied for another academic position, the hiring researcher remarked that he didn't hire women because they too often stayed home with sick children. Later, an employment agency reviewed her résumé and dismissed her as just a housewife who went back to school.\\n\\nDr. Sandler had run head first into a problem that had only recently been given a name: sex discrimination. Knowing she was not alone, she embarked on a campaign that would change the culture on college campuses — and eventually the law with the passage in 1972 of Title IX, the landmark legislation that banned sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDr. Sandler, who was widely celebrated as the godmother of Title IX, died Jan. 5 at her home in Washington. She was 90. The cause was cancer, said her daughter Deborah Sandler.\\n\\nTrained in psychology and counseling, Dr. Sandler devoted decades of her life to documenting, analyzing and stopping the forms of discrimination — subtle and overt — that held women back academically and professionally in educational settings.\\n\\nWhen she began her advocacy efforts, many university departments arbitrarily limited the number of women they would hire. Others hired no women at all. Some disqualified married women. Some colleges barred female students from chemistry and other departments that were deemed more suited for men.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDr. Sandler investigated and found that there was no federal law prohibiting discrimination against women in educational fields. There was, however, an executive order signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson that prohibited sex discrimination by organizations with federal contracts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt was a genuine 'Eureka' moment, she later recalled in an account of her work. I actually shrieked aloud for I immediately realized that many universities and colleges had federal contracts, were therefore subject to the sex discrimination provisions of the Executive Order, and that the Order could be used to fight sex discrimination on American campuses.\\n\\nDr. Sandler joined the Women's Equity Action League and, as the one-member Federal Action Contract Compliance Committee, challenged 250 educational institutions with allegations of sex discrimination. She also coordinated a letter-writing campaign that, by her account, generated so much Congressional mail that the Departments of Labor, and Health, Education and Welfare had to assign several full-time personnel to handle the letters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAccording to the National Women's Hall of Fame, where Dr. Sandler was inducted in 2013, her efforts led to the first federal investigation of sex discrimination on campuses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe worked for a House subcommittee with oversight of the matter and for the Health, Education and Welfare Department as momentum grew, culminating with passage of Title IX. Its chief legislative champions included Rep. Edith Green (D-Ore.), Rep. Patsy Mink (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.). Today, Title IX is widely known as the guarantor of equal access to collegiate athletics.\\n\\nFor decades after the law was passed, Dr. Sandler continued her activism for gender equality in the classroom. As a speaker and author, she sought to draw attention to what she and a fellow researcher, Roberta M. Hall, in a widely read 1982 academic paper termed the chilly classroom environment for women.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFemale professors, she found, were more likely than male professors to be challenged on their credentials. Those with PhDs were not consistently addressed as Dr., and students expected greater leniency from women when they failed to complete their assignments.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFemale students, for their part, were more likely to receive an uh-huh from a professor when they participated in class, rather than the more engaged response that might greet a male student.\\n\\nWhen Title IX was passed, I was quite naive, Dr. Sandler said. I thought all the problems of sex discrimination in education would be solved in one or two years at most. When two years passed, I increased my estimate to five years, then later to 10, then to 50, and now I realize it will take many generations to solve all the problems.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBernice Resnick — she went by Bunny — was born in New York City on March 3, 1928. Her parents ran a women's clothing store in New Jersey.\\n\\nSexist practices, she recalled, seemed practically part of the natural order of the world. When I applied to college it was openly known that women needed higher grades and test scores in order to be accepted, she recalled in a history of Title IX. No one complained — it was just the way things were.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe received a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College in 1948 and a master's degree from the City College of New York in 1950, both in psychology, and a PhD in counseling from the University of Maryland in 1969.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDr. Sandler spent two decades as the director of the Project on the Status and Education of Women at the Association of American Colleges until she stepped down in 1991. She later held associations with institutions including the Center for Women Policy Studies in Washington and was a sought-after witness in discrimination and sexual harassment cases. As an activist, she also highlighted the danger of rape on campuses.\\n\\nDr. Sandler's marriage to Jerrold Sandler ended in divorce. Survivors include two daughters, Deborah Sandler of Martinez, Calif., and Emily Sanders of Los Angeles; and three grandchildren.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLater in her career, Dr. Sandler explored the chilly environment on campus that greeted minorities much as it greeted women. Interviewed in 1994 by the publication Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education, she reflected on the rejection that sent her on a path of advocacy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI don't think I would have noticed if they'd said you come on too strong, she said. The problem was that phrase too strong for a woman."}
{"original": "Saudi Arabia, a lead rebel sponsor during the war, seems increasingly willing to accept Assad remaining in Damascus, hoping to lessen his dependence on Riyadh's regional rival, Iran. It is even expected that the Arab League, which expelled Assad following his brutal crackdown on protesters in 2011 that initiated the civil war, will welcome him back in 2019.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow isolated was Assad really?\\n\\nOf course, Assad was never that internationally isolated — one of the main reasons he has survived. Vital assistance from allies Russia and Iran is well documented. Russia ensured that Damascus faced no United Nations-led sanctions, such as those suffered by Iraq's Saddam Hussein, while alongside Iran, Moscow provided aid, loans and support to keep Assad's state and military just about functioning.\\n\\nThe remaining BRICS (Brazil, India, China and South Africa), like many non-western states, did not demand Assad stand down. China was most supportive, vetoing anti-Assad U.N. Security Council resolutions six times since 2011, but India, too, retained ties to Damascus, fearing the rise of Islamists and possibly rewarding Syria for its past pro-Delhi stance on Kashmir. Brazil withdrew its ambassador to Syria, but for safety reasons rather than an explicitly anti-Assad action. Even before the recent election of right wing pro-torture President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil stated its wish to restore full ties and take part in reconstruction.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRebuilding Syria will be costly\\n\\nThe BRICS and Assad's allies are unlikely to provide much of the estimated $400 billion needed to rebuild postwar Syria. The wealthiest, China, seems lukewarm, while Russia and Iran lack the funds. Assad and his allies have long recognized that only Persian Gulf or Western aid could provide the reconstruction billions needed, and this is the true value of any warming of Arab ties.\\n\\nWhile rejoining the Arab League brings economic reward and marks a symbolic end to attempts by Assad's Arab enemies to topple him — and will be used by the Syrian dictator domestically to underline his victory — even in the Arab world Damascus's isolation was never complete. Lebanon and Iraq refused to join any gulf states-led sanctions and maintained close ties, while Jordan retained a diplomatic presence in Syria even while forced by the war and external political pressure to halt trade and grant rebel fighters safe haven. Further afield, Algeria, a fellow dictatorship that also fought an insurgency in the 1990s, opposed the Arab League's expulsion of Syria and acted as backchannel thereafter, while the Sisi regime in Egypt also developed covert ties.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRoadblocks to Assad's rehabilitation: the U.S., E.U. and Turkey\\n\\nDespite these positives, Assad's road to full rehabilitation remains blocked by three significant obstacles: the United States, the European Union and NATO-ally Turkey. The United States seems the most immovable of these. While Trump's shock decision to withdraw troops from Syria boosts Assad's stated desire to reconquer, every inch, of territory, there is no indication this will come alongside any softening toward Damascus. Pro-Israel and anti-Iran voices in Washington make it unlikely U.S. sanctions will be lifted anytime soon. These restrictions on U.S. companies and citizens dealing with or financing any work in Syria remain problematic and deter international investors.\\n\\nE.U. sanctions are similarly problematic, although not as harsh, but the Europeans are more ambivalent about Assad. There has long been a split among E.U. members on Syria: France, Britain and Germany backed Washington's tough stance, but doubts were expressed by Syria's neighboring southern European states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith Assad's survival now all but guaranteed, these voices — many hosting Syrian refugees that they want to return — will grow louder. As Britain departs the E.U. and Germany hosts 600,000 Syrians, France may find itself unable to prevent a shift in European policy. E.U. policy is slow-moving and will still seek to attach conditions to the gradual lifting of any sanctions or provision of aid. While it may eventually split with Washington on Syria, Assad will have to wait some time yet.\\n\\nThe more pressing obstacle, however, is Turkey. Syria's economy and especially its war-ravaged second city, Aleppo, would be greatly boosted by reopening routes into Turkey — currently blocked by both Ankara and the Turkish-backed rebels controlling Idlib. Though Turkey has dropped demands for Assad to go, three contested areas prevent reconciliation.\\n\\nFirst, after Trump's withdrawal Ankara and Damascus could come to blows over eastern Syria. Turkey wants to push out Washington's former Kurdish allies it sees as terrorists, while Syria may reach accommodation with them to regain the region. Much will depend on whether Russia can mediate any deal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSecond is Idlib, the last rebel-held pocket of Syria that Assad is determined to retake but is protected by Turkey, which fears being flooded with refugees and militants should Idlib fall. Finally, there is the chunk of northern Syria between Afrin and Jarabulus currently held by Turkey through rebel proxies Ankara seems reluctant to give up. These issues are unlikely to be resolved swiftly. Even if some kind of agreement can be reached over border trade and highways, Turkey and Syria seem years way from any kind of normalization.\\n\\nAssad will welcome any return to the Arab League, but its significance should not be overstated. On the one hand Syria was far from isolated throughout its civil war, and on the other it remains a long way from reconciling with western governments and Turkey. Not that this will overly concern Damascus. The Assad regime has decades of experience withstanding western and regional sanctions and isolation, most recently in the mid 2000s.\\n\\nIts strategy has long been to wait for international conditions to change in its favor than alter its policies. The recent opening from Arab states will further vindicate this approach, and Assad will be confident that eventually the west and Ankara will also come round, no matter how long it takes."}

{"original": "Last week, Del. Lee J. Carter (D-Manassas) announced his bid for the party's nomination for governor, joining former delegate Jennifer D. Carroll Foy (D-Prince William) in this year's primary election.\\n\\nMeanwhile Dels. Hala S. Ayala (D-Prince William) and Elizabeth R. Guzman (D-Prince William) are competing in a crowded field of Democrats who want to become lieutenant governor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTheir bids reflect the fact that once-conservative Prince William has become a hub of liberal energy in Virginia, political analysts say — allowing local Democratic activist Candi King to raise nearly four times as much as Republican Heather Mitchell in Tuesday's special election to fill the seat Carroll Foy vacated in December to focus on her gubernatorial bid.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWin or lose in 2021, the influence of Democrats in Prince William will grow in the coming years, said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. Prince William County has been one of the locations with the greatest Democratic gains over the last decade, and it makes sense that the field of statewide candidates reflects that.\\n\\nOnce predominantly White, Prince William was long known for the former head of its Board of County Supervisors, Republican firebrand Corey A. Stewart, who became a fierce acolyte of President Trump after the 2016 election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nToday, 55 percent of the county's population is either Latino, African American or Asian, and the local Democratic Party committee has been infused with new activism fueled by the demographic shift.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 2017, voters in Prince William and nearby Manassas City and Manassas Park also elected Danica A. Roem (D-Manassas), the nation's first openly transgender lawmaker, into the House of Delegates.\\n\\nIn 2019, the county board flipped to a 5-to-3 Democratic majority after being controlled by the GOP for more than a decade.\\n\\nLocal Democrats say the area reflects the broader changes occurring in Virginia, and a desire to do more about issues of long importance to Democrats such as affordable health care, workers' rights and criminal justice overhauls.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are still conservative pockets in the area, but Republicans have been able to win only local races in recent years — a reality Stewart cited in 2019 when he decided against pursuing another term as county board chair.\\n\\nWhere goes Prince William County, so goes the Commonwealth of Virginia, said Carroll Foy, whose former district includes portions of nearby Stafford County, which in November voted blue for the first time in nearly half a century. We are a community filled with working families and millennials, people of color and women, and that's what our party looks like. We are the center of Democratic energy.\\n\\nCarroll Foy, 39, presents herself as a gritty embodiment of that energy, telling voters in her gubernatorial race about how in 2017 she campaigned for office while she was pregnant with her twin sons, with morning sickness and swollen ankles.\\n\\nShe, Guzman and Ayala were part of a group of activists who brought a sense of urgency to the local Democratic Party committee, which has since evolved into a formidable fundraising apparatus for new candidates like King.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat movement was born during the local backlash against new immigrants in the county that helped launch Stewart's political career.\\n\\nIt gained more enthusiasm in 2008, when Barack Obama held the final campaign rally of his first presidential run inside the Prince William County Fairgrounds, where the then-senator from Illinois urged a crowd of about 80,000 to change the world.\\n\\nIt was really inspiring to see a Democratic candidate who was a person of color inspire so many people, said Guzman, one of the early opponents of the federal 287(g) agreement championed by Stewart that allowed the county to hold incarcerated undocumented inmates for deportation after their jail sentences expired.\\n\\nThe most important part was, if we really believed in his message, we needed to grab a clipboard and start knocking on doors, Guzman, 47, said of Obama's impact.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter Trump's 2016 victory, more activists began eyeing the area's General Assembly seats that had long been held by Republicans.\\n\\nAyala, who recently announced she will not seek reelection to her House seat in the fall, said those officials did not appear to understand the needs of a growing population of constituents in their districts who were struggling to stay afloat in the increasingly expensive Washington region.\\n\\nI understand how thin that bridge is between struggle and success, said Ayala, 47, who was a single mother dependent on Medicaid for her son, who suffered from various health issues, before she went on to become a cyber­security specialist for the Department of Homeland Security.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarter, a self-proclaimed socialist inspired by the presidential run of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), argued that the coronavirus pandemic has made it necessary for all of Virginia to move further to the left.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe've got to make sure that, when we rebuild the economy, we're not engaging in the same kind of corporate handouts we've engaged in during the past decade, said Carter, 33.\\n\\nWhether the more-liberal positions of all of the Prince William candidates resonate enough with the state's Democratic electorate is an open question, political analysts say.\\n\\nHistorically, more-moderate Democrats have prevailed in Virginia, including Gov. Ralph Northam in 2017 and former governor Terry McAuliffe in 2013.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis year, McAuliffe is again the likely front-runner in a Democratic field of gubernatorial candidates that also includes Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and state Sen. Jennifer L. McClellan (Richmond), political analysts say.\\n\\nIn the lieutenant governor's race, Guzman and Ayala are competing against six other well-known Democrats — making it harder for them to gain traction with voters outside of Prince William.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat makes the decisions by Carroll Foy and Ayala to let go of their House seats a gamble, said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.\\n\\nThere is a real risk to jumping too soon and not being successful, and then you're gone, essentially, Kidd said.\\n\\nBoth Democrats said the risk is worth a chance to set the state's direction on the economy and long-ignored social inequities from a higher office. They also expressed confidence in their party's ability to hold on to their seats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Tuesday's race, Mitchell, who lost to Carroll Foy by 22 points in 2019, has emphasized her experience as a former senior aide to Stewart on the Board of County Supervisors.\\n\\nMitchell, who declined to be interviewed, has also played up her residency in Stafford County, where the district's more conservative voters live.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGarren Shipley, the spokesman for House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah), said the fact that both candidates have had less than four weeks to campaign gives Mitchell a strong chance at victory on Tuesday.\\n\\nHe noted that the turnout for early voting for the special election, an option overwhelmingly picked by Democrats in November's presidential race, has been low. As of Monday, about 850 had voted early in a district of nearly 51,000 active voters.\\n\\nThe fact that we saw such a bifurcated vote in November, between Democrats voting early and Republicans voting on Election Day, makes me hopeful, Shipley said.\\n\\nKing, a program assistant for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, acknowledged that she may not be as well-known in the district as Mitchell.\\n\\nBut King, who has outraised Mitchell $103,000 to $27,500, believes there is enough Democratic enthusiasm in the area for her to prevail."}
{"original": "Then came the scandal.\\n\\nA sharply critical report released last week by the city found that Ballou administrators told teachers that a high percentage of their students were not expected to pass and encouraged them to provide makeup work and extra credit to students, no matter how much school they missed. The result: Some students received diplomas when they had not earned them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in interviews this week, Ballou students, teachers and parents said that the dysfunctional school depicted in that report scarcely resembles the school they know. They insist that the problems uncovered at Ballou exist at other schools — something the school district report confirmed.\\n\\nStudents from other schools are now picking on Ballou, saying we are stupid and illiterate, Shae'Lynn Ames, a junior, said. As soon as we do something good, something negative comes out against us.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe nine students, teachers and parents who were interviewed took particular exception to the decision to remove the school's principal, Yetunde Reeves.\\n\\nReeves, they said, instilled a renewed sense of pride on campus, making the school seem like a place where students with challenging lives can escape and be teenagers. Parents said this makes the harsh spotlight on Ballou all the more demoralizing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese kids were prospering. The school was going in a great direction, said LaTonya Ames, Shae'Lynn's mother. Six of Ames's children graduated from Ballou, and she said she sat on a parent committee that vetted Reeves before she was appointed principal. The school was just getting back to what a school was supposed to be.\\n\\nFive teachers said Reeves encouraged them to work with students individually, helping them learn even if the typical classroom structure did not work for them. Sometimes, that meant meeting with students during lunch or free periods, or giving them an extra project.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTwo Ballou students were shot and killed this academic year, one teacher noted. So it was only natural, he said, that classmates would miss school while they grieved or require additional help to complete their work.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI feel like we're now in a culture where we're forced to fail students, where we used to be able to provide solutions, said Tiffany Kidd, a math educator at the school. There's been anger and frustration.\\n\\nAttendance and graduation records that were documented in the investigation commissioned by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education were damning, and clearly demonstrated that district policy was not followed: About 35 percent of Ballou's 2017 graduates missed most of the school year. D.C. schools policy dictates that students should fail a class if they are absent 30 times.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the report also showed that Ballou was not alone, and other neighborhood schools where large portions of the students come from low-income backgrounds also graduated students with dismal attendance rates.\\n\\nBecause of the investigation released last week — and because of a joint report by WAMU and NPR in November that brought to light the issues at the school — Ballou quickly turned into a symbol of the failures of school reform in the District.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhy aren't other principals being removed? Why only Dr. Reeves? Tatiana Robinson, a junior, said. She helped students believe we have a fighting chance.\\n\\nReeves, who contends that she never pressured teachers to pass students, said in an interview Friday that the attendance figures are more complicated than the report can convey. Ballou students, she said, face more challenges than typical high school students and can find it difficult to be in school for each period of the day. In the District, students who miss 20 percent or more of the school day are marked absent for the entire day.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAccording to Reeves, some Ballou students have to drop off and pick up siblings at their schools. Others leave school early to commute to afternoon jobs, while others care for ailing parents and grandparents. The school experienced a high turnover of teachers last year, and administrators struggled to get students to classes taught by substitute teachers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou can't go to Ballou and just close the door and teach. You have to deal with attendance, you have to deal with trauma, you have to deal with kids who are behind, Reeves said. Our kids do require a different level of effort. For me, it was about creating an environment where kids felt connected to the building and they felt there were people in the building who supported them.\\n\\nTeacher Shajena Cartagena said that a homeless student in her first-period class drops off younger siblings at different schools and takes multiple buses to get to school. The student wants to complete her work, and Cartagena is willing to meet with her during lunch and free periods to help her catch up, but is forced to fail the student because of absences.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm feeling disheartened, Cartagena said. It feels like the pendulum has swung to accountability without understanding the social-emotional learning they need.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nReeves and the teachers who were interviewed said that this personalized teaching has not resulted in less academic rigor.\\n\\nStudents not being in class was an issue, but students not mastering material was not an issue, Adam Evans, a history teacher, said.\\n\\nThe students who were interviewed said that classmates were devastated when they learned Reeves would not be returning to school and angry they did not have a voice in her fate.\\n\\nReeves said she still receives messages from students asking for help with college applications and checking in to see how she is doing."}
{"original": "Before this year, Super Bowl commercials were blocked in Canada by a practice called simultaneous substitution, which aims to protect Canadian broadcasters while allowing TV viewers to watch U.S.-based channels. When programs are shown at the same time on both Canadian and U.S. outlets, the Canadian broadcaster gets to substitute its ads for U.S. ads on the American feed.\\n\\nSo a Canadian tuning in to CBS to see the Super Bowl 50 last year didn't see the glitzy ads from U.S. advertisers, but rather more mundane fare from the likes of Bank of Montreal and the Loblaws supermarket chain. That has angered Canadians, who have been forced to go to YouTube if they wanted to get a look at the most talked about Super Bowl ads.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut this year, Canada's broadcast regulator will change the 40-year-regulations to allow American Super Bowl ads to air, saying it's for the sake of consumer choice. While fans are happy — Hirsch-Allen knows his wife and other Super Bowl guests seem to care much more about the commercials — the decision has infuriated the National Football League and Bell Media, the parent of Canada's largest broadcaster, CTV, which have banded together with Canadian ad agencies and the creative community to cry foul. Backed by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), there are even calls for the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to override the decision by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission and reinstitute the ban on Super Bowl ads.\\n\\nMichael Geist, a law professor specializing in Internet and e-commerce at the University of Ottawa, says that the idea of simultaneous substitution is increasingly irrelevant in a world of specialty channels, recording devices and live streaming. He thinks the Super Bowl decision is a kind of toe in the water that may eventually lead to the end of the substitution practice entirely.\\n\\nThat would be bad news for Canadian broadcasters. Simultaneous substitution of ads is worth an estimated $250 million (Canadian) a year to the broadcasters, who build their programming around access to popular U.S. series and sports events. The Super Bowl is the most watched broadcast in the country; last year, 8.3 million Canadians watched the Super Bowl in English and French while only 3.9 million tuned into the most recent Grey Cup, the championship game of the Canadian Football League.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn turn, broadcasters are supposed to use some of that ad revenue to invest in Canadian programming.\\n\\nThe NFL is livid at the Super Bowl ad change. It says it sold the rights to its schedule, including the Super Bowl, to CTV under one set of rules and now finds those regulations changed midstream. The league also complains it's been unfairly singled out, with no other program aside from the Super Bowl affected. It's random, arbitrary and pretty harmful, said Jocelyn Moore, the NFL's senior vice president of public policy and government affairs. We're just asking for a fair shake.\\n\\nIt's clear the NFL doesn't like the prospect of lower ad revenue for the broadcast. When U.S. broadcasters bid for rights to the Super Bowl, they don't typically pay for access for Canadian viewers. So when Audi, Honda or Skittles buy ads for this year's game on Fox, they will effectively be getting free access to millions of Canadian consumers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "But the broader picture could yet be quite grim. This past week marked the formal start of a new decade. To kick it off, Today's WorldView spotlights three trendlines that could define the years to come.\\n\\nChanging demographics\\n\\nAccording to a 2015 U.N. study, the world is expected to have a population of about 8.5 billion people in 2030 — about a 15 percent increase in the size of humanity in just 15 years. India will have surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation, while demographers forecast a pronounced population surge in sub-Saharan Africa, which will soon be home to the world's most youthful societies. The number of megacities may double by the end of the decade, with close to two-thirds of humanity living in urban centers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn addition, by 2030, more than a billion people on the planet will be over the age of 65, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health. That's due to longer life expectancies and improving living standards around the world. But the maturing of the world population — not just in the West, but throughout Asia and Latin America, too — carries real policy conundrums.\\n\\nEuropean governments are already grappling with a future shaped by rising costs for elder care, the consequences of declining populations and a shrinking workforce. The political solutions to these long-term challenges may include encouraging more immigration to fill jobs and weakening social protections to drive worker productivity. Demographic anxieties will almost certainly take up greater space in Western politics: On both sides of the Atlantic, far-right movements increasingly see anti-feminism as a rallying cry at a time of declining birthrates.\\n\\nChina's authoritarian leadership is all too aware of the need to pivot given its aging population and has set about trying to reorient the Chinese economy to cater more to a domestic market after years of export-driven boom. In a decade's time, we may also know whether India's youth glut — more than half of its population is under 25 — has turned into either a demographic boon or a curse. The world's largest democracy is already struggling to support its vast population of young people with adequate education, health care and jobs.\\n\\nThe deepening toll of climate change\\n\\n2030 represents a major milestone for the international organizations and climate scientists that have been climate change's doleful town criers. Two years ago, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that without huge, unprecedented cuts to carbon emissions over the next decade, the world would place itself on the brink of climate disaster. Subsequent studies suggested that, even if the demands of climate activists were met, it would take decades to measure any discernible effects.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are reasons for hope. Myriad governments have embraced ambitious plans to transition their economies toward being carbon neutral. The incoming Biden administration intends to add momentum to global climate efforts abandoned by President Trump, while Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month that China plans to decrease its carbon footprint to at least 65 percent of where it was in 2005 by 2030. The World Economic Forum — a bastion of optimism — foresees a future in 2030 in which urban centers are transformed into zones shaped by pedestrian activity, technology increasingly obviates the need to own cars, fewer people eat meat, people breathe cleaner air and renewable, clean energy dominates the energy sector.\\n\\nThat's the rosy view. The demands of a rising middle class in the developing world may prove a challenge to decarbonization efforts, while climate skepticism may further drive a host of right-wing movements in the West as their opponents go green. Rather than a warning to the world, melting ice caps in the Arctic are already opening new trade lanes and avenues for exploration, stoking a new era of geopolitical competition. All the while, scientists predict an increasing number of extreme weather events wracking the world and destabilizing vulnerable communities.\\n\\nThe mess of global governance\\n\\nThe past decade shifted our view of global politics. Long gone is any certainty in the inexorability of liberal democracy — single-party states still flourish, while demagogic populism and far-right nationalism are powerful forces within many of the world's major democracies. Rights groups warn of the erosion of once-healthy democracies and new threats to freedom and privacy posed by government cyber surveillance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVisions of a robust liberal world order have given way to white papers on the return of great-power competition. That includes the new race over research and the use of technologies such as artificial intelligence, which is predicted to add some $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. China has poured vast resources into its tech sector and is arguably the global pacesetter in the development and implementation of AI technologies, an advantage that has huge political implications. Whoever leads in artificial intelligence in 2030 will rule the world till 2100, declared a recent policy briefing from the Brookings Institution.\\n\\nLiberals in the West hope the serious challenges of the next decade — all of which require expanded international cooperation and coordination — will eventually dispel the angry nationalism of the present."}

{"original": "Before the event, though, the Institute had set up a book display on a table in the hallway and offered the books for sale. There were four books, including Failing to Confront Islamic Totalitarianism: From George W. Bush to Barack Obama and Beyond, by the Institute's Onkar Ghate and Elan Journo:\\n\\nSome students disapproved of the book and started arguing with the Institute people. And then a law school administrator demanded that the Institute remove the book, apparently on the grounds that it was inflammatory.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat, I think, was clearly wrong, and indeed a violation of the First Amendment. Public universities can't bar groups — student groups or others — from displaying books on the grounds that the viewpoints are inflammatory.\\n\\nUniversities can impose content-neutral rules, and likely even content-based but viewpoint-neutral rules, on what goes on in their hallways. They could, for instance, ban all sales of books. They could ban such sales by outside groups. They could require permission before any sales of anything take place, so long as the permission is granted or denied without regard to the viewpoint expressed by the materials being sold — indeed, it appears that UCLA has such a policy. But they can't discriminate based on the book's supposedly offensive viewpoint, even if the hallway is viewed as a so-called nonpublic forum. (See Rosenberger v. Rector (1995).) Moreover, even if they apply such no-sales rules in a content-neutral way, that would only justify telling the group not to sell the book, rather than telling the group to stop displaying the book. As I said, this was a clear error on the administrator's part; I'm sorry that it happened at my own law school.\\n\\nFortunately, I'm glad to say that the dean has written to the Ayn Rand Institute to extend my [i.e., the Dean's] apologies and acknowledged that the administrator's action was not in keeping with UCLA Law's — or my — vigorous commitment to support free speech and respectful debate. It also failed to adhere to our commitment that university policies be applied in a content-neutral manner. And the dean stressed that the school was taking steps to prevent such occurrences, by beefing up training and procedures. I know the dean pretty well, and I think she's quite sincere about this.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere's my role in the situation: The event was on Wednesday, Feb. 1, and late Thursday evening, a student emailed me to let me know about the incident. I was very troubled by this and corresponded with the Ayn Rand Institute people to get more facts; late Friday evening, I emailed the law school's vice-dean about this. (I chose the vice-dean partly because he is the faculty administrator who seemed likely to have some authority over this, and partly because he's a good friend of mine and I trust his good faith and judgment.) The vice-dean was traveling but said he'd look into this, which is what he did during the week.\\n\\nHe kept in touch with me during the week, and the following Saturday (the 11th) in the morning, he got back to me to say that there was indeed a problem and that the school would be sending the event organizers an apology and making clear to people at the school that this shouldn't happen. (For whatever it's worth, this message was sent to me several hours before Elan Journo's post about the incident went up, and to my knowledge it wasn't prompted by any existing or impending news coverage.) The letter was sent to the Institute that Wednesday morning (the 15th). The Institute in turn promptly responded with a gracious acknowledgment, which also noted that [a]part from the incident the event went smoothly and was successful, with the audience inside the room [being] lively, engaged and respectful of the speakers; and the Institute praised the Federalist Society student chapter for its work promoting the event (which particularly pleased me, since I'm the chapter's adviser)."}

I'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan, and I shouldn't be happy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump added: As you know, President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I.\\n\\nPresident Trump abruptly announced Dec. 23 he was removing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in January, two months before his planned departure. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeither Mattis nor Shanahan could be reached for comment. The Pentagon did not respond to questions about Trump's remarks.\\n\\n\\n\\nMattis, who is beloved by many in the military, resigned Dec. 20, citing policy disagreements with the president. Mattis had said he would stay on through the end of February to provide continuity during transition to a new leader, but Trump abruptly forced him out days later. Shanahan took over Tuesday.\\n\\nTrump's comments in the meeting about Syria and Afghanistan added new complications to discussions about U.S. plans in those countries.\\n\\nRegarding Afghanistan, where about 14,000 troops are deployed, Trump questioned why Pakistan, India and Russia — the latter a U.S. adversary — aren't more involved, and why the U.S. military strikes both the Islamic State and the Taliban in areas where the groups are fighting each other.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI said, 'Let them fight! They're both our enemies! Let them fight!'  Trump said. And then they go in and end up fighting both of them. It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.\\n\\nRegarding Syria, the president said that Iran can do what they want there, frankly, contradicting warnings from other senior U.S. officials and allies including Israel, who have warned for years that Iran wants to build a military presence in Syria.\\n\\nAbout two weeks ago, Trump ordered all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria and directed withdrawal plans be drawn up for about half the forces in Afghanistan.\\n\\nTrump initially wanted all U.S. troops out of Syria within 30 days, triggering Mattis's resignation and concerns from Republicans and Democrats that the decision would create more chaos in the region. The president, in a video posted on his Twitter account Dec. 19, said U.S. troops were all coming back from Syria and that they're coming back now.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president has since softened on that approach and said Wednesday that the U.S. military will exit Syria over a period of time. He has agreed to give the military about four months to completely depart Syria, according to three U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy discussions. That development was first reported by the New York Times.\\n\\nBut U.S. officials suggested Wednesday that the plan remains unclear. While Trump agreed to a 120-day timeline, military officials have cautioned that an additional month or two would allow for a smoother transition and hope to persuade the president to give them more time, the officials said.\\n\\nOfficials at the State Department have struggled to explain the U.S. strategy in Syria to key foreign partners invested in the conflict, given the possibility that Trump's advisers might persuade him to back off his initial withdrawal plan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPentagon officials, who rarely discuss troop movements before they occur, have declined to say how long a withdrawal will take.\\n\\nWe are focused on a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of forces, taking all measures possible to ensure our troops' safety as they continue in their mission of an enduring defeat of ISIS, said Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman. Out of concern for operational security, we are not going to discuss operational details.\\n\\nThe discussions have added tension to the ascension of Shanahan, who joined the Trump administration in 2017 with years of management experience at Boeing but no government or military experience.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShanahan said in a statement that he has tapped David L. Norquist, an undersecretary of defense who serves as comptroller, to perform the duties of the deputy defense secretary. Norquist has served as the Defense Department's chief financial officer since mid-2017 and has insight into virtually every tenet of this department, Shanahan said.\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShanahan said in a tweet early Wednesday evening that his top priority is ensuring the Defense Department is lethal and agile. He has met with senior leaders and his policy team, and his focus remains on the National Defense Strategy, in which Mattis last year called for the Pentagon to prepare for threats posed by adversaries such as Russia and China, he wrote.\\n\\nWith Mattis gone, one of his planned moves — bringing in Marine Maj. Gen. Burke W. Whitman to serve as a new senior spokesman — will not happen. Whitman was expected to brief the media in 2019 alongside chief Pentagon spokeswoman Dana W. White, who abruptly resigned on New Year's Eve as Mattis left the Pentagon. White is under investigation by the Defense Department inspector general amid accusations that she directed subordinate staff members carry out menial tasks for her.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the Pentagon's history, there have been two previous acting defense secretaries: William P. Clements Jr. and William Howard Taft IV. Clements held the post for 39 days in 1973 after President Richard M. Nixon appointed Defense Secretary Elliot Richardson as attorney general, and Taft led the Pentagon for 60 days as the Senate rejected President George H.W. Bush's first Pentagon chief nominee, John Tower, amid allegations of womanizing and alcohol abuse.\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump said in a visit to Iraq last month that everybody and his uncle and everybody and his aunt has interest in becoming defense secretary, but he added that Shanahan could be there for a long time. The president did not say whether he meant in an acting capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile serving as acting Pentagon chief, Shanahan will have the full authorities the job includes, said Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine major general who helped write the Goldwater-Nichols Act that guides civilian control of the military. However, the framers of the law did not anticipate that someone would serve as acting defense secretary indefinitely without Senate confirmation, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPunaro called Norquist a good choice to take on deputy defense secretary duties and said the decision was complicated by the departure in November of Chief Management Officer John Jay Gibson, who held the No. 3 position in the Pentagon. The duties of the chief management officer have been carried out since by Deputy Chief Management Officer Lisa Hershman, who has not gone through a Senate confirmation process.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarter Ham, a retired Army general, described Shanahan as very capable but said he believes Trump should select a permanent defense secretary soon for the sake of continuity."}
{"original": "The basket of 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average did even better, rocketing 25 percent last year while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index grew by 20 percent.\\n\\nGold and stocks don't usually rise at the same time. Gold prices historically retreat when investors feast on stocks. And when stocks are wheezing, gold tends to surge.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo what happened?\\n\\nKim Jong Un, for one.\\n\\nThe North Korean leader's test — after test, after test, after test, after test — of ballistic missiles has put the world on edge; so has President Trump's threats in response. Gold is one of those places people flee when they worry that things may get messy.\\n\\nI would attribute some of the rise in the price of gold to the feeling of uncertainty surrounding that [North Korean-U.S.] dialogue, said Meghan Milloy, director of Financial Services Policy at the American Action Forum, in an email to The Washington Post.\\n\\nYou look at those missile launches and see an increase in the price of gold, said David Meger, director of metals trading for High Ridge Futures in Chicago.\\n\\nThat's not the whole story. The apprehensions behind the gold surge include an ever-expanding federal debt, inflation fears, a steadily pricier stock market, rioting in Iran and the tinder box that is the rest of the Middle East.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThen there is the state of commodities in general. Commodities are getting more expensive as a world economic boom consumes everything from copper to oil to palladium, the latter used in products as varied as catalytic converters and flutes. Palladium is up 60 percent in the last year.\\n\\nGold is absolutely a safe haven, but it is also a commodity, Meger said. It benefits from the same premise that we see in this U.S. and global economic recovery with commodities across the board doing well.\\n\\nMeger said he is taking gold orders up and down the investing profile, from institutions to wealthy people to mom-and-pops trying to diversify their nest egg. Aside from geopolitics and the economic tide lifting commodities along with everything else, there is a nagging fear that inflation may be around the corner.\\n\\nPeople buying gold could be looking at this economic growth as potential for inflation creeping into the market in the months ahead, he said. Interest rates could be increasing in the months ahead. Gold is an inflation hedge.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGold has its naysayers.\\n\\nIt pays no interest, costs money to store it and has no intrinsic value, said Daniel P. Wiener, chief executive of Adviser Investments, a Newton, Mass.-based firm that manages more than $5 billion in assets. If you value those gold bars, you better have insurance on it, too.\\n\\nWiener said people buy gold during tough times because it's one of the oldest currencies in the world. But he argues it is not a hedge against long-term inflation.\\n\\nThe price of an ounce of gold was at nearly $2,800 in January 1980 on an inflation-adjusted basis, Wiener said. Today it's at $1,300-something.\\n\\nPeople have long been comfortable with gold because they can touch it, store it, look at it and make things with it. Unlike real estate, it's fungible. You can move it from one place to another, even from one country to another, and still sell it at the world rate. That is not always true for other valuables. Try packing your suitcase with oil or paintings, cocoa beans or cattle.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGold has several properties that make it a valuable commodity. It is relatively rare, does not tarnish and is easily alloyed with other metals. In addition to being soft, it resists corrosion and can be melted down and transported into many forms, which is why it is used most often in jewelry.\\n\\nThere are several ways to invest in the precious metal.\\n\\nMeger primarily sells gold two ways: physical gold in bars and, secondly, through futures contracts in which the buyer agrees to take ownership of a specified amount of gold some time in the future at a set price.\\n\\nInvestors can also buy gold through exchange-traded funds and through the purchase of stock in companies that mine for gold.\\n\\nGold, though, remains a highly volatile investment. The price for an ounce of gold reached above $1,800 in 2011 only to drop to below $1,100 in 2015. The price of gold declined to nearly $250 an ounce in 1999 in the midst of the dot-com bubble."}
{"original": "Instead, the agreement was pushed through in the final moments of 2020 as Germany's term in the rotating seat of the E.U. presidency came to an end. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose country's automobile and industrial sectors are hungry for Chinese market access, was a driving force behind the agreement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe agreement, if it is ratified, would theoretically loosen restrictions on European companies in China's tightly controlled market, wrote my colleague Emily Rauhala. European companies would no longer be required to operate joint ventures with Chinese partners, for instance, or be forced to share technology.\\n\\nExperts in China viewed the developments as a significant win for Beijing. The deal will deepen the economic ties between China and the E.U., with negotiating a free-trade agreement being the expected next step, Wu Xinbo, director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, told the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong-based daily. And it will also thwart the U.S. plan to join hands with Europe and isolate China from the future of globalization.\\n\\nEuropean leaders contend that they are securing for their bloc similar terms to what the Trump administration negotiated with Beijing in its own Phase 1 trade deal brokered at the beginning of last year. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said last week that tighter cooperation with Beijing would still allow Europe the ability to promote its core values and nudge China on political and economic reforms.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCritics say that position is woefully shortsighted, arguing that Europe is knitting itself closer to an increasingly authoritarian China at a time when Beijing has shown little inclination to follow rules, Rauhala added.\\n\\nThat obscures the charged political atmosphere surrounding the West's relations with Beijing. The stories coming out of Xinjiang are pure horror. The story in Brussels is we're ready to sign an investment treaty with China, liberal European lawmaker Guy Verhofstadt tweeted Wednesday. Under these circumstances any Chinese signature on human rights is not worth the paper it is written on.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs far as E.U.-U.S. relations are concerned, the deal's timing seems unfortunate. In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria aired Sunday, Jake Sullivan, Biden's pick for White House national security adviser, stressed the incoming administration's desire to meet with like-minded allies and move past the distrust sown during Trump's bruising time in office.\\n\\nWe are confident that we can develop a common agenda on issues where we share deep concerns on China, Sullivan said.\\n\\nThe announced deal, though, is an indication of a different reality. Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have both separately emphasized the need for Europe to develop its strategic autonomy, weaning itself off more than half a century of sheltering under the umbrella of the Pax Americana. But, in this instance, critics note, Europe may be undermining what prospect there was of a meaningful united front on China.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCountries mulling how far to stand up to China will draw their own conclusions: Europe talks about values but self-interest trumps solidarity, wrote Edward Lucas in the Times of London. The deal exemplifies the gap between the EU's foreign policy aims and reality. The European Commission claims to be 'geopolitical.' In 2019 it deemed China a 'strategic rival.' Yet the mercantilist influence of big business, particularly in Germany, steamrollers ethical and security concerns.\\n\\nNoah Barkin, a senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund for the United States, argued Merkel has prioritized the business interests of her country's flagship firms and is keen to show that productive dialogue with China on various fronts is both possible and necessary. She has made these overtures even when the majority of the German public holds distinctly negative views of Beijing.\\n\\nIn an increasingly black-and-white world where liberal democracies face an existential challenge from authoritarians and populists, Merkel still sees gray — and not only with China, Barkin wrote in Foreign Policy. The bargain she brokered recently with democratic backsliders Hungary and Poland to avert a clash over the EU budget is another example. George Soros accused her of surrendering to extortion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome analysts see Merkel's pragmatism as naivete. They doubt that expanded business ties will do much to discipline the behavior — as an E.U. statement put it — of China's state-owned companies. And they fear that the agreement will bend Europe more to China than the other way around.\\n\\nEven in the current geopolitical order, China has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to use its economic power as a strategic weapon, wrote Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman. By deepening their economic reliance on China — without co-ordinating their policy with fellow democracies — European nations are increasing their vulnerability to pressure from Beijing."}
{"original": "That late July day, this town along the banks of the Kalamazoo River became the latest community affected by a ubiquitous class of compounds known as polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. For years, calls for the federal government to regulate the chemicals have been unsuccessful, and last year the Trump administration tried to block publication of a study urging a much lower threshold of exposure.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe man-made chemicals have long been used in a wide range of consumer products, including nonstick cookware, water-repellent fabrics and grease-resistant paper products, as well as in firefighting foams. But exposures have been associated with an array of health problems, among them thyroid disease, weakened immunity, infertility risks and certain cancers. The compounds do not break down in the environment.\\n\\nIn Parchment, where they were once used by a long-shuttered paper mill, tests found PFAS levels in the water system in excess of 1,500 parts per trillion — more than 20 times the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended lifetime exposure limit of 70 parts per trillion.\\n\\nLocal officials promptly alerted residents. Michigan officials declared a state of emergency. People started picking up free cases of bottled water at the high school. Within weeks, the town abandoned the municipal wells that had served 3,000 people and began getting water from nearby Kalamazoo.\\n\\nThis is not a problem you can run away from, said Parchment resident Tammy Cooper, who has become an outspoken advocate for better regulation. There are Parchments across the country.\\n\\nHarvard University researchers say public drinking-water supplies serving more than 6 million Americans have tested for the chemicals at or above the EPA's threshold — which many experts argue should be far lower to safeguard public health. The level is only an agency guideline;the federal government does not regulate PFAS.\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe compounds' presence has rattled communities from Hoosick Falls, N.Y., to Tucson. They have been particularly prevalent on or near military bases, which have long used PFAS-laden foams in training exercises.\\n\\nBoth houses of Congress held hearings on the problem last year, and lawmakers introduced bills to compel the government to test for PFAS chemicals nationwide and to respond wherever water and soil polluted by them are found. In late November, the head of the EPA vowed that the agency would soon unveil a national strategy to address the situation.\\n\\nAffected communities are still waiting.\\n\\nThere are some very real human impacts from this stuff, said Erik Olson, a drinking-water expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Most people have no idea they are being exposed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMichigan is one of the few states where officials are trying to determine the extent of PFAS contamination. Health officials undertook statewide tests this year across 1,380 public water supplies and at more than 400 schools that operate their own wells.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen we look for it, we tend to find it, said Eden Wells, the state's chief medical executive. Yet detection raises difficult questions, given the lack of regulation involving PFAS in water and the evolving research on its long-term health effects.\\n\\nMany of our responses are outstripping the scientific knowledge we need, Wells said.\\n\\nMore is known about two particular types of the chemicals, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), which companies phased out years ago amid growing evidence that both were ending up in the blood of nearly every American. But thousands of other PFAS chemicals remain in use — among the many threats, including arsenic and lead, to drinking water nationwide.\\n\\nFrom a policy perspective, what bothers me about all this is there are industries everywhere that don't really have to report what they are using, said Detlef Knappe, a North Carolina State University environmental engineer whose research helped identify another PFAS chemical, known as GenX, in Wilmington's drinking water supply. As a class, there are so many compounds . . . and it pops up in the most unexpected places.\\n\\nThe Trump administration's focus on the problem has been inconsistent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPolitico reported in May that the White House and EPA sought to block publication of a federal health study on the nationwide effects of PFAS contamination after one administration aide warned in an email that it could result in a public relations nightmare. The study from the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which eventually was released, suggested that the EPA's existing, nonenforceable standard is inadequate to protect public health and should be much lower.\\n\\nThe same month, the EPA held a PFAS summit with industry representatives, public health groups, tribal leaders and officials from all levels of government. Then-administrator Scott Pruitt pledged action, saying, There are concerns about these chemicals across the country because of their persistence, their durability, getting into the environment and impacting communities in an adverse way.\\n\\nLittle has happened since then, however.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt a hearing in early fall, Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) pressed the EPA's director of groundwater and drinking water on when the agency might announce its plans to regulate the chemicals and finalize a drinking-water standard. Peter Grevatt, an agency veteran who recently retired, responded that officials were continuing to visit communities and develop a long-term management plan. He acknowledged that it could take the agency a number of years to put enforceable regulations in place — if it determined that the contaminants were surfacing in enough water systems to be considered a nationwide health concern.\\n\\nIs it a national standard that requires all the nation's systems to sample on some regular basis and has the tools to get treatment in place? Grevatt said. Or is it something that we'll address more locally?\\n\\nEnvironmental attorney Robert Bilott successfully sued DuPont on behalf of plaintiffs exposed to PFOA in Ohio and West Virginia, and this year he filed a class-action lawsuit against 3M, DuPont, Chemours and several other companies on behalf of all Americans with PFAS chemicals in their blood. Some states have taken aggressive steps on their own, with New Jersey the first to regulate certain types of PFAS chemicals in its drinking water.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFederal attention is long overdue, Bilott contends.\\n\\nIt's a national issue that needs to be addressed in a national way, he said.\\n\\nAt least outwardly, a sense of normalcy has returned to Parchment.\\n\\nBottled water is no longer being handed out at the high school, though the town is still relying on water from Kalamazoo. Officials say their investigation is ongoing, with one likely culprit of the contamination being a local landfill once used by the now-closed paper mill.\\n\\nYet beneath the surface, many people continue to worry.\\n\\nIn our minds, our water was safe, said Mayor Robert D. Britigan III, who noted that Parchment always had been in compliance with Michigan's drinking-water regulations. The city has since left the municipal water business. We will never go back to those wells, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn a sunny day this fall, customers lined up at the window of Twisters for the last ice cream cones of the season. The regulars sat in their usual spots inside Scooter D's, a popular diner off the main drag, where the waitresses call people sweetheart and the smell of hash browns hangs in the air.\\n\\nWe lost a lot of business, primarily because of fear, said manager Carrie Klinger, whose father started the diner more than two decades ago. During the month-long water crisis, the family bought 80 pounds of bagged ice a day, made soups with bottled water and served canned sodas because the drink machine was hooked to a water line.\\n\\nIt's still not quite back to where it was, Klinger said. I still have customers who say they'll never drink the water again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEchoes of that distrust linger on Glendale Boulevard, where Jennifer and Justin Koehler lived in a tidy, white clapboard house until selling and moving away because of their fears.\\n\\nIt made me so scared, because our kids are so little. And it made me angry, Jennifer Koehler said of the water problems in Parchment.\\n\\nTheir former neighbors, Tammy Cooper and her husband David, have wrestled with the same emotions. What did this crisis do? It woke me up to what the government is and is not doing on many levels, she said.\\n\\nDown the street, life for Sara and Matt Dean remains a mix of anxiety, resignation and doubt.\\n\\nWe relocated here thinking it would be a really great life decision, Sara Dean said as her 2-year-old son, Patrick, played on the floor. You're supposed to hear about this somewhere else. This is the most average of average communities that there could be. It's 'Leave It To Beaver' average. If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe family spent thousands of dollars to install a top-notch water filter. Still, they hesitate to wash their vegetables or cook with tap water. It's just this giant question mark, Matt Dean said. Are we responsible staying here?"}
{"original": "National Security 'The intelligence coup of the century' For decades, the CIA read the encrypted communications of allies and adversaries. Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\\n\\nFor more than half a century, governments all over the world trusted a single company to keep the communications of their spies, soldiers and diplomats secret.\\n\\nThe company, Crypto AG, got its first break with a contract to build code-making machines for U.S. troops during World War II. Flush with cash, it became a dominant maker of encryption devices for decades, navigating waves of technology from mechanical gears to electronic circuits and, finally, silicon chips and software.\\n\\nThe Swiss firm made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries well into the 21st century. Its clients included Iran, military juntas in Latin America, nuclear rivals India and Pakistan, and even the Vatican.\\n\\nBut what none of its customers ever knew was that Crypto AG was secretly owned by the CIA in a highly classified partnership with West German intelligence. These spy agencies rigged the company's devices so they could easily break the codes that countries used to send encrypted messages.\\n\\nThe decades-long arrangement, among the most closely guarded secrets of the Cold War, is laid bare in a classified, comprehensive CIA history of the operation obtained by The Washington Post and ZDF, a German public broadcaster, in a joint reporting project.\\n\\nThe account identifies the CIA officers who ran the program and the company executives entrusted to execute it. It traces the origin of the venture as well as the internal conflicts that nearly derailed it. It describes how the United States and its allies exploited other nations' gullibility for years, taking their money and stealing their secrets.\\n\\nThe operation, known first by the code name Thesaurus and later Rubicon, ranks among the most audacious in CIA history.\\n\\nIt was the intelligence coup of the century, the CIA report concludes. Foreign governments were paying good money to the U.S. and West Germany for the privilege of having their most secret communications read by at least two (and possibly as many as five or six) foreign countries.\\n\\nFrom 1970 on, the CIA and its code-breaking sibling, the National Security Agency, controlled nearly every aspect of Crypto's operations — presiding with their German partners over hiring decisions, designing its technology, sabotaging its algorithms and directing its sales targets.\\n\\nThen, the U.S. and West German spies sat back and listened.\\n\\nThey monitored Iran's mullahs during the 1979 hostage crisis, fed intelligence about Argentina's military to Britain during the Falklands War, tracked the assassination campaigns of South American dictators and caught Libyan officials congratulating themselves on the 1986 bombing of a Berlin disco.\\n\\nA Royal Navy helicopter takes off after transporting Royal Marines to Darwin, Falkland Islands, in 1982.

America's main adversaries, including the Soviet Union and China, were never Crypto customers. Their well-founded suspicions of the company's ties to the West shielded them from exposure, although the CIA history suggests that U.S. spies learned a great deal by monitoring other countries' interactions with Moscow and Beijing.\\n\\nThere were also security breaches that put Crypto under clouds of suspicion. Documents released in the 1970s showed extensive — and incriminating — correspondence between an NSA pioneer and Crypto's founder. Foreign targets were tipped off by the careless statements of public officials including President Ronald Reagan. And the 1992 arrest of a Crypto salesman in Iran, who did not realize he was selling rigged equipment, triggered a devastating storm of publicity, according to the CIA history.\\n\\nBut the true extent of the company's relationship with the CIA and its German counterpart was until now never revealed.\\n\\nThe German spy agency, the BND, came to believe the risk of exposure was too great and left the operation in the early 1990s. But the CIA bought the Germans' stake and simply kept going, wringing Crypto for all its espionage worth until 2018, when the agency sold off the company's assets, according to current and former officials.\\n\\nThe company's importance to the global security market had fallen by then, squeezed by the spread of online encryption technology. Once the province of governments and major corporations, strong encryption is now as ubiquitous as apps on cellphones.\\n\\nEven so, the Crypto operation is relevant to modern espionage. Its reach and duration help to explain how the United States developed an insatiable appetite for global surveillance that was exposed in 2013 by Edward Snowden. There are also echoes of Crypto in the suspicions swirling around modern companies with alleged links to foreign governments, including the Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky, a texting app tied to the United Arab Emirates and the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei.\\n\\nThis story is based on the CIA history and a parallel BND account, also obtained by The Post and ZDF, and interviews with current and former Western intelligence officials as well as Crypto employees. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the subject.\\n\\nIt is hard to overstate how extraordinary the CIA and BND histories are. Sensitive intelligence files are periodically declassified and released to the public. But it is exceedingly rare, if not unprecedented, to glimpse authoritative internal histories of an entire covert operation. The Post was able to read all of the documents, but the source of the material insisted that only excerpts be published.\\n\\nClick any underlined text in the story to see an excerpt from the CIA history.\\n\\nThe CIA and the BND declined to comment, though U.S. and German officials did not dispute the authenticity of the documents. The first is a 96-page account of the operation completed in 2004 by the CIA's Center for the Study of Intelligence, an internal historical branch. The second is an oral history compiled by German intelligence officials in 2008.\\n\\nThe overlapping accounts expose frictions between the two partners over money, control and ethical limits, with the West Germans frequently aghast at the enthusiasm with which U.S. spies often targeted allies.\\n\\nBut both sides describe the operation as successful beyond their wildest projections. At times, including in the 1980s, Crypto accounted for roughly 40 percent of the diplomatic cables and other transmissions by foreign governments that cryptanalysts at the NSA decoded and mined for intelligence, according to the documents.\\n\\nAll the while, Crypto generated millions of dollars in profits that the CIA and BND split and plowed into other operations.\\n\\nCrypto's sign is still visible atop its longtime headquarters near Zug, Switzerland, though the company was liquidated in 2018. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\\n\\nCrypto's products are still in use in more than a dozen countries around the world, and its orange-and-white sign still looms atop the company's longtime headquarters building near Zug, Switzerland. But the company was dismembered in 2018, liquidated by shareholders whose identities have been permanently shielded by the byzantine laws of Liechtenstein, a tiny European nation with a Cayman Islands-like reputation for financial secrecy.\\n\\nTwo companies purchased most of Crypto's assets. The first, CyOne Security, was created as part of a management buyout and now sells security systems exclusively to the Swiss government. The other, Crypto International, took over the former company's brand and international business.\\n\\nEach insisted that it has no ongoing connection to any intelligence service, but only one claimed to be unaware of CIA ownership. Their statements were in response to questions from The Post, ZDF and Swiss broadcaster SRF, which also had access to the documents.\\n\\nCyOne has more substantial links to the now-dissolved Crypto, including that the new company's chief executive held the same position at Crypto for nearly two decades of CIA ownership.\\n\\nA CyOne spokesman declined to address any aspect of Crypto AG's history but said the new firm has no ties to any foreign intelligence services.\\n\\nAndreas Linde, the chairman of the company that now holds the rights to Crypto's international products and business, said he had no knowledge of the company's relationship to the CIA and BND before being confronted with the facts in this article.\\n\\nWe at Crypto International have never had any relationship with the CIA or BND — and please quote me, he said in an interview. If what you are saying is true, then absolutely I feel betrayed, and my family feels betrayed, and I feel there will be a lot of employees who will feel betrayed as well as customers.\\n\\nThe Swiss government announced on Tuesday that it was launching an investigation of Crypto AG's ties to the CIA and BND. Earlier this month, Swiss officials revoked Crypto International's export license.\\n\\nThe timing of the Swiss moves was curious. The CIA and BND documents indicate that Swiss officials must have known for decades about Crypto's ties to the U.S. and German spy services, but intervened only after learning that news organizations were about to expose the arrangement.\\n\\nThe histories, which do not address when or whether the CIA ended its involvement, carry the inevitable biases of documents written from the perspectives of the operation's architects. They depict Rubicon as a triumph of espionage, one that helped the United States prevail in the Cold War, keep tabs on dozens of authoritarian regimes and protect the interests of the United States and its allies.\\n\\nThe papers largely avoid more unsettling questions, including what the United States knew — and what it did or didn't do — about countries that used Crypto machines while engaged in assassination plots, ethnic cleansing campaigns and human rights abuses.\\n\\nThe revelations in the documents may provide reason to revisit whether the United States was in position to intervene in, or at least expose, international atrocities, and whether it opted against doing so at times to preserve its access to valuable streams of intelligence.\\n\\nNor do the files deal with obvious ethical issues at the core of the operation: the deception and exploitation of adversaries, allies and hundreds of unwitting Crypto employees. Many traveled the world selling or servicing rigged systems with no clue that they were doing so at risk to their own safety.\\n\\nJuerg Spoerndli is an electrical engineer who spent 16 years working at Crypto. Deceived employees said the revelations about the company have deepened a sense of betrayal, of themselves and customers. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\\n\\nIn recent interviews, deceived employees — even ones who came to suspect during their time at Crypto that the company was cooperating with Western intelligence — said the revelations in the documents have deepened a sense of betrayal, of themselves and customers.\\n\\nYou think you do good work and you make something secure, said Juerg Spoerndli, an electrical engineer who spent 16 years at Crypto. And then you realize that you cheated these clients.\\n\\nThose who ran the clandestine program remain unapologetic.\\n\\nDo I have any qualms? Zero, said Bobby Ray Inman, who served as director of the NSA and deputy director of the CIA in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was a very valuable source of communications on significantly large parts of the world important to U.S. policymakers.\\n\\nBoris Hagelin, the founder of Crypto, and his wife arrive in New York in 1949. Hagelin fled to the United States when the Nazis occupied Norway in 1940. (Bettmann Archive)\\n\\nA denial operation\\n\\nThis sprawling, sophisticated operation grew out of the U.S. military's need for a crude but compact encryption device.\\n\\nBoris Hagelin, Crypto's founder, was an entrepreneur and inventor who was born in Russia but fled to Sweden as the Bolsheviks took power. He fled again to the United States when the Nazis occupied Norway in 1940.\\n\\nHe brought with him an encryption machine that looked like a fortified music box, with a sturdy crank on the side and an assembly of metal gears and pinwheels under a hard metal case.\\n\\nIt wasn't nearly as elaborate, or secure, as the Enigma machines being used by the Nazis. But Hagelin's M-209, as it became known, was portable, hand-powered and perfect for troops on the move. Photos show soldiers with the eight-pound boxes — about the size of a thick book — strapped to their knees. Many of Hagelin's devices have been preserved at a private museum in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.\\n\\nMarc Simons and Paul Reuvers founded the Crypto Museum in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The virtual museum has preserved many of Hagelin's devices. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Hagelin's M-209 encryption machine had a crank on the side and an assembly of metal gears and pinwheels under a hard metal case. Portable and hand-powered, it was used mainly for tactical messages about troop movements. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post) Marc Simons and Paul Reuvers founded the Crypto Museum in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The virtual museum has preserved many of Hagelin's devices.

Portable and hand-powered, it was used mainly for tactical messages about troop movements. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\\n\\nSending a secure message with the device was tedious. The user would rotate a dial, letter by letter, and thrust down the crank. The hidden gears would turn and spit out an enciphered message on a strip of paper. A signals officer then had to transmit that scrambled message by Morse code to a recipient who would reverse the sequence.\\n\\nSecurity was so weak that it was assumed that nearly any adversary could break the code with enough time. But doing so took hours. And since these were used mainly for tactical messages about troop movements, by the time the Nazis decoded a signal its value had probably perished.\\n\\nOver the course of the war, about 140,000 M-209s were built at the Smith Corona typewriter factory in Syracuse, N.Y., under a U.S. Army contract worth $8.6 million to Crypto. After the war, Hagelin returned to Sweden to reopen his factory, bringing with him a personal fortune and a lifelong sense of loyalty to the United States.\\n\\nEven so, American spies kept a wary eye on his postwar operations. In the early 1950s, he developed a more advanced version of his war-era machine with a new, irregular mechanical sequence that briefly stumped American code-breakers.\\n\\nMarc Simons, co-founder of Crypto Museum, a virtual museum of cipher machines, explains how secret messages were created using the Hagelin CX-52. (Stanislav Dobak/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAlarmed by the capabilities of the new CX-52 and other devices Crypto envisioned, U.S. officials began to discuss what they called the Hagelin problem.\\n\\nThese were the Dark Ages of American cryptology,  according to the CIA history. The Soviets, Chinese and North Koreans were using code-making systems that were all but impenetrable. U.S. spy agencies worried that the rest of the world would also go dark if countries could buy secure machines from Hagelin.\\n\\nThe Americans had several points of leverage with Hagelin: his ideological affinity for the country, his hope that the United States would remain a major customer and the veiled threat that they could damage his prospects by flooding the market with surplus M-209s from the war.\\n\\nThe U.S. Army's Signals Intelligence Service was headed by William Friedman, center, in the mid-1930s. Other members, from left: Herrick F. Bearce, Solomon Kullback, U.S. Army Capt. Harold G. Miller, Louise Newkirk Nelson, seated, Abraham Sinkov, U.S. Coast Guard Lt. L.T. Jones and Frank B. Rowlett. (Fotosearch/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe United States also had a more crucial asset: William Friedman. Widely regarded as the father of American cryptology, Friedman had known Hagelin since the 1930s. They had forged a lifelong friendship over their shared backgrounds and interests, including their Russian heritage and fascination with the complexities of encryption.\\n\\nThere might never have been an Operation Rubicon if the two men had not shaken hands on the very first secret agreement between Hagelin and U.S. intelligence over dinner at the Cosmos Club in Washington in 1951.\\n\\nThe deal called for Hagelin, who had moved his company to Switzerland, to restrict sales of his most sophisticated models to countries approved by the United States. Nations not on that list would get older, weaker systems. Hagelin would be compensated for his lost sales, as much as $700,000 up front.\\n\\nIt took years for the United States to live up to its end of the deal, as top officials at the CIA and the predecessor to the NSA bickered over the terms and wisdom of the scheme. But Hagelin abided by the agreement from the outset, and over the next two decades, his secret relationship with U.S. intelligence agencies deepened.\\n\\nIn 1960, the CIA and Hagelin entered into a licensing agreement  that paid him $855,000 to renew his commitment to the handshake deal. The agency paid him $70,000 a year in retainer and started giving his company cash infusions of $10,000 for marketing expenses to ensure that Crypto — and not other upstarts in the encryption business — locked down contracts with most of the world's governments.\\n\\nIt was a classic denial operation in the parlance of intelligence, a scheme designed to prevent adversaries from acquiring weapons or technology that would give them an advantage. But it was only the beginning of Crypto's collaboration with U.S. intelligence. Within a decade, the whole operation belonged to the CIA and BND.\\n\\nIn 1967, Crypto released the H-460, an all-electronic machine whose inner workings were designed by the NSA. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\\n\\nA brave new world\\n\\nU.S. officials had toyed since the outset with the idea of asking Hagelin whether he would be willing to let U.S. cryptologists doctor his machines. But Friedman overruled them, convinced that Hagelin would see that as a step too far.\\n\\nThe CIA and NSA saw a new opening in the mid-1960s, as the spread of electronic circuits forced Hagelin to accept outside help adapting to the new technology, or face extinction clinging to the manufacturing of mechanical machines.\\n\\nNSA cryptologists were equally concerned about the potential impact of integrated circuits, which seemed poised to enable a new era of unbreakable encryption. But one of the agency's senior analysts, Peter Jenks, identified a potential vulnerability.\\n\\nIf carefully designed by a clever crypto-mathematician, he said, a circuit-based system could be made to appear that it was producing endless streams of randomly generated characters, while in reality it would repeat itself at short enough intervals for NSA experts — and their powerful computers — to crack the pattern.\\n\\nTwo years later, in 1967, Crypto rolled out a new, all-electronic model, the H-460, whose inner workings were completely designed by the NSA.\\n\\nThe CIA history all but gloats about crossing this threshold. Imagine the idea of the American government convincing a foreign manufacturer to jimmy equipment in its favor, the history says. Talk about a brave new world.\\n\\nThe NSA didn't install crude back doors or secretly program the devices to cough up their encryption keys. And the agency still faced the difficult task of intercepting other governments' communications, whether plucking signals out of the air or, in later years, tapping into fiber optic cables.\\n\\nBut the manipulation of Crypto's algorithms streamlined the code-breaking process, at times reducing to seconds a task that might otherwise have taken months. The company always made at least two versions of its products — secure models that would be sold to friendly governments, and rigged systems for the rest of the world.\\n\\nIn so doing, the U.S.-Hagelin partnership had evolved from denial to active measures. No longer was Crypto merely restricting sales of its best equipment but actively selling devices that were engineered to betray their buyers.\\n\\nThe payoff went beyond the penetration of the devices. Crypto's shift to electronic products buoyed business so much that it became addicted to its dependence on the NSA. Foreign governments clamored for systems that seemed clearly superior to the old clunky mechanical devices but in fact were easier for U.S. spies to read.\\n\\nGerman and American partners\\n\\nBy the end of the 1960s, Hagelin was nearing 80 and anxious to secure the future for his company, which had grown to more than 180 employees. CIA officials were similarly anxious about what would happen to the operation if Hagelin were to suddenly sell or die.\\n\\nHagelin had once hoped to turn control over to his son, Bo. But U.S. intelligence officials regarded him as a wild card and worked to conceal the partnership from him. Bo Hagelin was killed in a car crash on Washington's Beltway in 1970. There were no indications of foul play.\\n\\nU.S. intelligence officials discussed the idea of buying Crypto for years, but squabbling between the CIA and NSA prevented them from acting until two other spy agencies entered the fray.\\n\\nThe French, West German and other European intelligence services had either been told about the United States' arrangement with Crypto or figured it out on their own. Some were understandably jealous and probed for ways to secure a similar deal for themselves.\\n\\nIn 1967, Hagelin was approached by the French intelligence service with an offer to buy the company in partnership with German intelligence. Hagelin rebuffed the offer and reported it to his CIA handlers. But two years later, the Germans came back seeking to make a follow-up bid with the blessing of the United States.\\n\\nIn a meeting in early 1969 at the West German Embassy in Washington, the head of that country's cipher service, Wilhelm Goeing, outlined the proposal and asked whether the Americans were interested in becoming partners too.\\n\\nMonths later, CIA Director Richard Helms approved the idea of buying Crypto and dispatched a subordinate to Bonn, the West German capital, to negotiate terms with one major caveat: the French, CIA officials told Goeing, would have to be shut out.\\n\\nWest Germany acquiesced to this American power play, and a deal between the two spy agencies was recorded in a June 1970 memo carrying the shaky signature of a CIA case officer in Munich who was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease and the illegible scrawl of his BND counterpart.\\n\\nThe two agencies agreed to chip in equally to buy out Hagelin for approximately $5.75 million, but the CIA left it largely to the Germans to figure out how to prevent any trace of the transaction from ever becoming public.\\n\\nA Liechtenstein law firm, Marxer and Goop, helped hide the identities of the new owners of Crypto through a series of shells and bearer shares that required no names in registration documents. The firm was paid an annual salary less for the extensive work but more for their silence and acceptance, the BND history says. The firm, now named Marxer and Partner, did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nA new board of directors was set up to oversee the company. Only one member of the board, Sture Nyberg, to whom Hagelin had turned over day-to-day management, knew of CIA involvement. It was through this mechanism, the CIA history notes, that BND and CIA controlled the activities of Crypto. Nyberg left the company in 1976. The Post and ZDF could not locate him or determine whether he is still alive.\\n\\nThe two spy agencies held their own regular meetings to discuss what to do with their acquisition. The CIA used a secret base in Munich, initially on a military installation used by American troops and later in the attic of a building adjacent to the U.S. Consulate, as the headquarters for its involvement in the operation.\\n\\nThe CIA and BND agreed on a series of code names for the program and its various components. Crypto was called Minerva, which is also the title of the CIA history. The operation was at first code-named Thesaurus, though in the 1980s it was changed to Rubicon.\\n\\nEach year, the CIA and BND split any profits Crypto had made, according to the German history, which says the BND handled the accounting and delivered the cash owed to the CIA in an underground parking garage.\\n\\nFrom the outset, the partnership was beset by petty disagreements and tensions. To CIA operatives, the BND often seemed preoccupied with turning a profit, and the Americans constantly reminded the Germans that this was an intelligence operation, not a money-making enterprise. The Germans were taken aback by the Americans' willingness to spy on all but their closest allies, with targets including NATO members Spain, Greece, Turkey and Italy.\\n\\nMindful of the limitations to their abilities to run a high-tech company, the two agencies brought in corporate outsiders. The Germans enlisted Siemens, a Munich-based conglomerate, to advise Crypto on business and technical issues in exchange for 5 percent of the company's sales. The United States later brought in Motorola to fix balky products, making it clear to the company's CEO this was being done for U.S. intelligence. Siemens declined to comment. Motorola officials did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nTo its frustration, Germany was never admitted to the vaunted Five Eyes, a long-standing intelligence pact involving the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. But with the Crypto partnership, Germany moved closer into the American espionage fold than might have seemed possible in World War II's aftermath. With the secret backing of two of the world's premier intelligence agencies and the support of two of the world's largest corporations, Crypto's business flourished.\\n\\nA table in the CIA history shows that sales surged from 15 million Swiss francs in 1970 to more than 51 million in 1975, or $19 million. The company's payroll expanded to more than 250 employees.\\n\\nThe Minerva purchase had yielded a bonanza, the CIA history says of this period. The operation entered a two-decade stretch of unprecedented access to foreign governments' communications.\\n\\nEgyptian President Anwar Sadat and President Jimmy Carter meet during the Egyptian-Israeli peace negotiations at Camp David in September 1978.

(White House/CNP/Getty Images)\\n\\nIranian suspicions\\n\\nThe NSA's eavesdropping empire was for many years organized around three main geographic targets, each with its own alphabetic code: A for the Soviets, B for Asia and G for virtually everywhere else.\\n\\nBy the early 1980s, more than half of the intelligence gathered by G group was flowing through Crypto machines, a capability that U.S. officials relied on in crisis after crisis.\\n\\nIn 1978, as the leaders of Egypt, Israel and the United States gathered at Camp David for negotiations on a peace accord, the NSA was secretly monitoring the communications of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat with Cairo.\\n\\nA year later, after Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy and took 52 American hostages, the Carter administration sought their release in back-channel communications through Algeria. Inman, who served as NSA director at the time, said he routinely got calls from President Jimmy Carter asking how the Ayatollah Khomeini regime was reacting to the latest messages.\\n\\nWe were able to respond to his questions about 85 percent of the time, Inman said. That was because the Iranians and Algerians were using Crypto devices.\\n\\nInman said the operation also put him in one of the trickiest binds he'd encountered in government service. At one point, the NSA intercepted Libyan communications indicating that the president's brother, Billy Carter, was advancing Libya's interests in Washington and was on leader Moammar Gaddafi's payroll.\\n\\nInman referred the matter to the Justice Department. The FBI launched an investigation of Carter, who falsely denied taking payments. In the end, he was not prosecuted but agreed to register as a foreign agent.\\n\\nThroughout the 1980s, the list of Crypto's leading clients read like a catalogue of global trouble spots. In 1981, Saudi Arabia was Crypto's biggest customer, followed by Iran, Italy, Indonesia, Iraq, Libya, Jordan and South Korea.\\n\\nTo protect its market position, Crypto and its secret owners engaged in subtle smear campaigns against rival companies, according to the documents, and plied government officials with bribes. Crypto sent an executive to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with 10 Rolex watches in his luggage, the BND history says, and later arranged a training program for the Saudis in Switzerland where the participants' favorite pastime was to visit the brothels, which the company also financed.\\n\\nAt times, the incentives led to sales to countries ill-equipped to use the complicated systems. Nigeria bought a large shipment of Crypto machines, but two years later, when there was still no corresponding payoff in intelligence, a company representative was sent to investigate. He found the equipment in a warehouse still in its original packaging, according to the German document.\\n\\nIn 1982, the Reagan administration took advantage of Argentina's reliance on Crypto equipment, funneling intelligence to Britain during the two countries' brief war over the Falkland Islands, according to the CIA history, which doesn't provide any detail on what kind of information was passed to London. The documents generally discuss intelligence gleaned from the operation in broad terms and provide few insights into how it was used.\\n\\nPlainclothes U.S. military officers walk around the scene of the bombing at the La Belle disco in West Berlin, which killed two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman in 1986. In an address, Reagan appears to have jeopardized the Crypto operation by citing evidence of Libya's complicity in the attack. (Andreas Schoelzel/Associated Press)\\n\\nReagan appears to have jeopardized the Crypto operation after Libya was implicated in the 1986 bombing of a West Berlin disco popular with American troops stationed in West Germany. Two U.S. soldiers and a Turkish woman were killed as a result of the attack.\\n\\nReagan ordered retaliatory strikes against Libya 10 days later. Among the reported victims was one of Gaddafi's daughters. In an address to the country announcing the strikes, Reagan said the United States had evidence of Libya's complicity that is direct, it is precise, it is irrefutable.\\n\\nThe evidence, Reagan said, showed that Libya's embassy in East Berlin received orders to carry out the attack a week before it happened. Then, the day after the bombing, they reported back to Tripoli on the great success of their mission.\\n\\nReagan's words made clear that Tripoli's communications with its station in East Berlin had been intercepted and decrypted. But Libya wasn't the only government that took note of the clues Reagan had provided.\\n\\nIran, which knew that Libya also used Crypto machines, became increasingly concerned about the security of its equipment. Tehran didn't act on those suspicions until six years later.\\n\\nCrypto AG United States West Germany WEST GERMANY U.S. 1980 borders Documents indicate that more than 120 countries used Crypto AG encryption equipment from the 1950s well into the 2000s.

Employees were well paid and had abundant perks including access to a small sailboat on Lake Zug near company headquarters.\\n\\nAnd yet, those who worked most closely with the encryption designs seemed constantly to be getting closer to uncovering the operation's core secret. The engineers and designers responsible for developing prototype models often questioned the algorithms being foisted on them by a mysterious external entity.\\n\\nCrypto executives often led employees to believe that the designs were being provided as part of the consulting arrangement with Siemens. But even if that were so, why were encryption flaws so easy to spot, and why were Crypto's engineers so routinely blocked from fixing them?\\n\\nIn 1977, Heinz Wagner, the chief executive at Crypto who knew the true role of the CIA and BND, abruptly fired a wayward engineer after the NSA complained that diplomatic traffic coming out of Syria had suddenly became unreadable. The engineer, Peter Frutiger, had long suspected Crypto was collaborating with German intelligence. He had made multiple trips to Damascus to address complaints about their Crypto products and apparently, without authority from headquarters, had fixed their vulnerabilities.\\n\\nFrutiger had figured out the Minerva secret and it was not safe with him, according to the CIA history. Even so, the agency was livid with Wagner for firing Frutiger rather than finding a way to keep him quiet on the company payroll. Frutiger declined to comment for this story.\\n\\nMengia Caflisch, circa 1990s. After she was hired by Crypto, Caflisch, a gifted electrical engineer, began probing the vulnerabilities of the company's products. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\\n\\nU.S. officials were even more alarmed when Wagner hired a gifted electrical engineer in 1978 named Mengia Caflisch. She had spent several years in the United States working as a radio-astronomy researcher for the University of Maryland before returning to her native Switzerland and applying for a job at Crypto. Wagner jumped at the chance to hire her. But NSA officials immediately raised concerns that she was too bright to remain unwitting.\\n\\nThe warning proved prescient as Caflisch soon began probing the vulnerabilities of the company's products. She and Spoerndli, a colleague in the research department, ran various tests and plaintext attacks on devices including a teletype model, the HC-570, that was built using Motorola technology, Spoerndli said in an interview.\\n\\nWe looked at the internal operations, and the dependencies with each step, Spoerndli said, and became convinced they could crack the code by comparing only 100 characters of enciphered text to an underlying, unencrypted message. It was an astonishingly low level of security, Spoerndli said in an interview last month, but far from unusual.\\n\\nThe algorithms, he said, always looked fishy.\\n\\nIn the ensuing years, Caflisch continued to pose problems. At one point, she designed an algorithm so strong that NSA officials worried it would be unreadable. The design made its way into 50 HC-740 machines rolling off the factory floor before company executives discovered the development and stopped it.\\n\\nI just had an idea that something might be strange, Caflisch said in an interview last month, about the origin of her suspicions. But it became clear that her probing wasn't appreciated, she said. Not all questions appeared to be welcome.\\n\\nThe company restored the rigged algorithm to the rest of the production run and sold the 50 secure models to banks to keep them out of the hands of foreign governments. Because these and other developments were so hard to defend, Wagner at one point told a select group of members of the research and development unit that Crypto was not entirely free to do what it wanted.\\n\\nThe acknowledgment seemed to subdue the engineers, who interpreted it as confirmation that the company's technology faced constraints imposed by the German government. But the CIA and BND became increasingly convinced that their routine, disembodied interference was unsustainable.\\n\\nCrypto had become an Oz-like operation with employees probing to see what was behind the curtain. As the 1970s came to a close, the secret partners decided to find a wizard figure who could help devise more advanced — and less detectable — weaknesses in the algorithms, someone with enough cryptological clout to tame the research department.\\n\\nThe two agencies turned to other spy services for potential candidates before settling on an individual put forward by Sweden's intelligence service. Because of Hagelin's ties to the country, Sweden had been kept apprised of the operation since its outset.\\n\\nKjell-Ove Widman, a mathematics professor in Stockholm, had made a name for himself in European academic circles with his research on cryptology. Widman was also a military reservist who had worked closely with Swedish intelligence officials.\\n\\nTo the CIA, Widman had an even more important attribute: an affinity for the United States that he had formed while spending a year in Washington state as an exchange student.\\n\\nHis host family had such trouble pronouncing his Swedish name that they called him Henry, a moniker he later used with his CIA handlers.\\n\\nOfficials involved in Widman's recruitment described it as almost effortless. After being groomed by Swedish intelligence officials, he was brought to Munich in 1979 for what purported to be a round of interviews with executives from Crypto and Siemens.\\n\\nThe fiction was maintained as Widman faced questions from a half-dozen men seated around a table in a hotel conference room. As the group broke for lunch, two men asked Widman to stay behind for a private conversation.\\n\\nDo you know what ZfCh is? asked Jelto Burmeister, a BND case officer, using the acronym for the German cipher service. When Widman replied that he did, Burmeister said, Now, do you understand who really owns Crypto AG?\\n\\nAt that point, Widman was introduced to Richard Schroeder, a CIA officer stationed in Munich to manage the agency's involvement in Crypto. Widman would later claim to agency historians that his world fell apart completely in that moment.\\n\\nIf so, he did not hesitate to enlist in the operation.\\n\\nWithout even leaving the room, Widman sealed his recruitment with a handshake. As the three men joined the rest of the group at lunch, a thumbs up signal transformed the gathering into a celebration.\\n\\nCrypto installed Widman as a scientific advisor reporting directly to Wagner. He became the spies' hidden inside agent, departing Zug every six weeks for clandestine meetings with representatives of the NSA and ZfCh. Schroeder, the CIA officer, would attend but tune out their technical babble.\\n\\nThey would agree on modifications and work up new encryption schemes. Then Widman would deliver the blueprints to Crypto engineers. The CIA history calls him the irreplaceable man, and the most important recruitment in the history of the Minerva program.\\n\\nHis stature cowed subordinates, investing him with a technical prominence that no one in CAG could challenge. It also helped deflect the inquiries of foreign governments. As Widman settled in, the secret partners adopted a set of principles for rigged algorithms, according to the BND history. They had to be undetectable by usual statistical tests and, if discovered, be easily masked as implementation or human errors.\\n\\nIn other words, when cornered, Crypto executives would blame sloppy employees or clueless users.\\n\\nIn 1982, when Argentina became convinced that its Crypto equipment had betrayed secret messages and helped British forces in the Falklands War, Widman was dispatched to Buenos Aires. Widman told them the NSA had probably cracked an outdated speech-scrambling device that Argentina was using, but that the main product they bought from Crypto, the CAG 500, remained unbreakable.\\n\\nThe bluff worked, the CIA history says. The Argentines swallowed hard, but kept buying CAG equipment.\\n\\nWidman is long-retired now and living in Stockholm. He declined to comment. Years after his recruitment, he told U.S. officials that he saw himself as engaged in a critical struggle for the benefit of Western intelligence, according to the CIA document. It was, he said, the moment in which he felt at home. This was his mission in life.\\n\\nThat same year, Hagelin, then 90 years old, became ill on a trip to Sweden and was hospitalized. He recovered well enough to return to Switzerland, but CIA officials became worried about Hagelin's extensive collection of business records and personal papers at his office in Zug.\\n\\nSchroeder, with Hagelin's permission, arrived with a briefcase and spent several days going through the files. To visitors, he was introduced as a historian interested in tracing Hagelin's life. Schroeder pulled out the documents that were incriminating, according to the history, and shipped them back to CIA headquarters, where they reside to this day.\\n\\nHagelin remained an invalid until he died in 1983. The Post could not locate Wagner or determine whether he is still alive. Schroeder retired from the CIA more than a decade ago and teaches part-time at Georgetown University. When contacted by a reporter from The Post, he declined to comment.\\n\\nThe Hydra crisis\\n\\nCrypto endured several money-losing years in the 1980s, but the intelligence flowed in torrents. U.S. spy agencies intercepted more than 19,000 Iranian communications sent via Crypto machines during that nation's decade-long war with Iraq, mining them for reports on subjects such as Tehran's terrorist links and attempts to target dissidents.\\n\\nIran's communications were 80 to 90 percent readable to U.S. spies, according to the CIA document, a figure that would probably have plunged into the single digits had Tehran not used Crypto's compromised devices.\\n\\nIn 1989, the Vatican's use of Crypto devices proved crucial in the U.S. manhunt for Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega. When the dictator sought refuge in the Apostolic Nunciature — the equivalent of a papal embassy — his whereabouts were exposed by the mission's messages back to Vatican City.\\n\\nIn 1992, however, the Crypto operation faced its first major crisis: Iran, belatedly acting on its long-standing suspicions, detained a company salesman.\\n\\nHans Buehler, then 51, was considered one of the company's best salesmen. Iran was one of the company's largest contracts, and Buehler had traveled in and out of Tehran for years. There were tense moments, including when he was questioned extensively in 1986 by Iranian officials after the disco bombing and U.S. missile strikes on Libya.\\n\\nSix years later, he boarded a Swissair flight to Tehran but failed to return on schedule. When he didn't show, Crypto turned for help to Swiss authorities and were told he had been arrested by the Iranians. Swiss consular officials allowed to visit Buehler reported that he was in bad shape mentally, according to the CIA history.\\n\\nBuehler was finally released nine months later after Crypto agreed to pay the Iranians $1 million, a sum that was secretly provided by the BND, according to the documents. The CIA refused to chip in, citing the U.S. policy against succumbing to ransom demands for hostages.\\n\\nBuehler knew nothing about Crypto's relationship to the CIA and BND or the vulnerabilities in its devices. But he returned traumatized and suspicious that Iran knew more about the company he worked for than he did. Buehler began speaking to Swiss news organizations about his ordeal and mounting suspicions.\\n\\nWilliam Friedman in Switzerland in 1957 with his wife and fellow cryptanalyst, Elizebeth Friedman, left, and Annie Hagelin, Boris Hagelin's wife.

Marshall Foundation) Boris Hagelin in 1972. (George C. Marshall Foundation)\\n\\nThe publicity brought new attention to long-forgotten clues, including references to a Boris project in Friedman's massive collection of personal papers, which were donated to Virginia Military Institute when he died in 1969. Among the 72 boxes delivered to Lexington, Va., were copies of his lifelong correspondence with Hagelin.\\n\\nIn 1994, the crisis deepened when Buehler appeared on Swiss television in a report that also featured Frutiger, whose identity was concealed from viewers. Buehler died in 2018. Frutiger, the engineer who had been fired for fixing Syria's encryption systems years earlier, did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nMichael Grupe, who had succeeded Wagner as chief executive, agreed to appear on Swiss television and disputed what he knew to be factual charges. Grupe's performance was credible, and may have saved the program, the CIA history says. Grupe did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nEven so, it took several years for the controversy to die down. In 1995, the Baltimore Sun ran a series of investigative stories about the NSA, including one called Rigging the Game that exposed aspects of the agency's relationship with Crypto.\\n\\nThe article reported NSA officials had traveled to Zug in the mid-1970s for secret meetings with Crypto executives. The officials were posing as consultants for a front company called Intercomm Associates but then proceeded to introduce themselves by their real names — which were recorded on notes of the meeting kept by a company employee.\\n\\nAmid the publicity onslaught, some employees began to look elsewhere for work. And at least a half-dozen countries — including Argentina, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Indonesia — either canceled or suspended their Crypto contracts.\\n\\nAstonishingly, Iran was not among them, according to the CIA file, and resumed its purchase of CAG equipment almost immediately.\\n\\nThe main casualty of the Hydra crisis, the code name given to the Buehler case, was the CIA-BND partnership.\\n\\nFor years, BND officials had recoiled at their American counterpart's refusal to distinguish adversaries from allies. The two partners often fought over which countries deserved to receive the secure versions of Crypto's products, with U.S. officials frequently insisting that the rigged equipment be sent to almost anyone — ally or not — who could be deceived into buying it.\\n\\nIn the German history, Wolbert Smidt, the former director of the BND, complained that the United States wanted to deal with the allies just like they dealt with the countries of the Third World. Another BND official echoed that comment, saying that to Americans, in the world of intelligence there were no friends.\\n\\nThe Cold War had ended, the Berlin Wall was down and the reunified Germany had different sensitivities and priorities. They saw themselves as far more directly exposed to the risks of the Crypto operation. Hydra had rattled the Germans, who feared the disclosure of their involvement would trigger European outrage and lead to enormous political and economic fallout.\\n\\nIn 1993, Konrad Porzner, the chief of the BND, made clear to CIA Director James Woolsey that support in the upper ranks of the German government was waning and that the Germans might want out of the Crypto partnership. On Sept. 9, the CIA station chief in Germany, Milton Bearden, reached an agreement with BND officials for the CIA to purchase Germany's shares for $17 million, according to the CIA history.\\n\\nGerman intelligence officials rued the departure from an operation they had largely conceived. In the German history, senior intelligence officials blame political leaders for ending one of the most successful espionage programs the BND had ever been a part of.\\n\\nWith their departure, the Germans were soon cut off from the intelligence that the United States continued to gather. Burmeister is quoted in the German history wondering whether Germany still belonged to this small number of nations who are not read by the Americans.\\n\\nThe Snowden documents provided what must have been an unsettling answer, showing that U.S. intelligence agencies not only regarded Germany as a target but monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cellphone.\\n\\nAlive and well\\n\\nThe CIA history essentially concludes with Germany's departure from the program, though it was finished in 2004 and contains clear indications that the operation was still underway.\\n\\nIt notes, for example, that the Buehler case was the most serious security breach in the history of the program but wasn't fatal. It did not cause its demise, the history says, and at the turn of the century Minerva was still alive and well.\\n\\nIn reality, the operation appears to have entered a protracted period of decline. By the mid-1990s, the days of profit were long past, and Crypto would have gone out of business but for infusions from the U.S. government.\\n\\nAs a result, the CIA appears to have spent years propping up an operation that was more viable as an intelligence platform than a business enterprise. Its product line dwindled and its revenue and customer base shrank.\\n\\nBut the intelligence kept coming, current and former officials said, in part because of bureaucratic inertia. Many governments just never got around to switching to newer encryption systems proliferating in the 1990s and beyond — and unplugging their Crypto devices. This was particularly true of less developed nations, according to the documents.\\n\\nMost of the employees identified in the CIA and BND histories are in their 70s or 80s, and some of them have died. In interviews in Switzerland last month, several former Crypto workers mentioned in the documents described feelings of unease about their involvement in the company.\\n\\nThey were never informed of its true relationship to intelligence services. But they had well-founded suspicions and still wrestle with the ethical implications of their decisions to remain at a firm they believed to be engaged in deception.\\n\\nEither you had to leave or you had to accept it in a certain way, said Caflisch, now 75, who left the company in 1995 but continues to live on the outskirts of Zug in a converted weaving factory where she and her family for many years staged semiprofessional operas in the barn. There were reasons I left, she said, including her discomfort with her doubts at Crypto and her desire to be home more for her children. After the latest revelations, she said, It makes me wonder whether I should have left earlier.\\n\\nSpoerndli said he regrets his own rationalizations.\\n\\nI told myself sometimes it may be better if the good guys in the United States know what is going on between these Third World dictators, he said. But it's a cheap self-excuse. In the end, this is not the way.\\n\\nMost of the executives directly involved in the operation were motivated by ideological purpose and declined any payment beyond their Crypto salaries, according to the documents. Widman was among several exceptions. As his retirement drew near, his covert compensation was substantially increased, the CIA history says. He was also awarded a medal bearing the CIA seal.\\n\\nAfter the BND's departure, the CIA expanded its clandestine collection of companies in the encryption sector, according to former Western intelligence officials. Using cash amassed from the Crypto operation, the agency secretly acquired a second firm and propped up a third. The documents do not disclose any details about these entities. But the BND history notes that one of Crypto's longtime rivals — Gretag AG, also based in Switzerland — was taken over by an 'American' and, after a change of names in 2004, was liquidated.\\n\\nCrypto itself hobbled along. It had survived the transitions from metal boxes to electronic circuits, going from teletype machines to enciphered voice systems. But it struggled to maintain its footing as the encryption market moved from hardware to software. U.S. intelligence agencies appear to have been content to let the Crypto operation play out, even as the NSA's attention shifted to finding ways to exploit the global reach of Google, Microsoft, Verizon and other U.S. tech powers.\\n\\nIn 2017, Crypto's longtime headquarters building near Zug was sold to a commercial real estate company. In 2018, the company's remaining assets — the core pieces of the encryption business started nearly a century earlier — were split and sold.\\n\\nThe transactions seemed designed to provide cover for a CIA exit.\\n\\nCyOne's purchase of the Swiss portion of the business was structured as a management buyout, enabling top Crypto employees to move into a new company insulated from the espionage risks and with a reliable source of revenue. The Swiss government, which was always sold secure versions of Crypto's systems, is now CyOne's only customer.\\n\\nGiuliano Otth, who served as CEO of Crypto AG from 2001 until its dismemberment, took the same position at CyOne after it acquired the Swiss assets. Given his tenure at Crypto, it is likely he was witting to the CIA ownership of the company, just as all of his predecessors in the job had been.\\n\\nNeither CyOne Security AG nor Mr. Otth have any comments regarding Crypto AG's history, the company said in a statement.\\n\\nCrypto's international accounts and business assets were sold to Linde, a Swedish entrepreneur, who comes from a wealthy family with commercial real estate holdings.\\n\\nIn a meeting in Zurich last month, Linde said he had been drawn to the company in part by its heritage and Hagelin connection, a past that still resonates in Sweden. Upon taking over operations, Linde even moved some of Hagelin's historic equipment from storage into a display at the factory entrance.\\n\\nWhen confronted with evidence that Crypto had been owned by the CIA and BND, Linde looked visibly shaken, and said that during negotiations he never learned the identities of the company's shareholders. He asked when the story would be published, saying he had employees overseas and voicing concern for their safety.\\n\\nIn a subsequent interview, Linde said his company is investigating all the products it sells to determine whether they have any hidden vulnerabilities. We have to make a cut as soon as possible with everything that has been linked to Crypto, he said.\\n\\nWhen asked why he failed to confront Otth and others involved in the transaction about whether there was any truth to the long-standing Crypto allegations, Linde said he had regarded these as just rumors.\\n\\nHe said he took assurance from the fact that Crypto continued to have substantial contracts with foreign governments, countries he assumed had tested the company's products vigorously and would have abandoned them if they were compromised.\\n\\nI even acquired the brand name, 'Crypto,'  he said, underscoring his confidence in the company's viability. Given the information now coming to light, he said, this was probably one of the most stupid decisions I've ever made in my career.\\n\\nThe company's liquidation was handled by the same Liechtenstein law firm that provided cover for Hagelin's sale to the CIA and BND 48 years earlier. The terms of the 2018 transactions have not been disclosed, but current and former officials estimated their aggregate value at $50 million to $70 million.\\n\\nFor the CIA, the money would have been one final payoff from Minerva.\\n\\nReporting for this article was done in collaboration with Peter F.

{"original": "The field of presidential candidates was more female than ever before. And the frigid streets of Washington filled once again with pink pussy hats and optimism — perhaps too much optimism — for what was becoming an iconic, annual tradition: the Women's March.\\n\\nThis is the last Women's March we're going to need because Trump is going to be gone by this time next year, Joann Edmunds, 69, a Roanoke resident who attended the march with three friends, told a Washington Post reporter last year. Once he's out of office, there won't be the same need for it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf only.\\n\\nEdmunds's prediction came true: There will be no official Women's March following the inauguration this year.\\n\\nBut that's not because the fight is over. While President Trump will be gone and Kamala D. Harris will have made history as the nation's first female vice president, feminists declaring victory right now would be as cringy as President George W. Bush's Mission Accomplished moment in 2003.\\n\\nThe pandemic makes a march of such scale too dangerous — even though a year later, the well-being of American women is still in peril and reason, more than ever, for an uprising.\\n\\nThough women resisted, persisted and continued to make progress in politics, policy and the workforce all four years that a misogynist was in office, it was the coronavirus (and Trump's handling of it) that has profoundly worsened the lives of women everywhere. Every day brings new examples of the ways in which women are being left behind by the world's response to the pandemic, philanthropist Melinda Gates wrote in Foreign Affairs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrom health care to education to employment to domestic violence and mental health, years of women's progress backslid thanks to the coronavirus.\\n\\nWomen were just barely the majority — 50.04 percent — of the American workforce last January. In April, 16.2 percent of women were unemployed, which meant women lost about 11 million jobs that month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Men lost 9 million jobs during the same time, and the total 20 million jobs lost is an American record since World War II, according to the BLS.\\n\\nThe losses were even more intense for Black (16.6 percent) and Latina (20.2 percent) women, according to BLS data.\\n\\nThe first wave of virus shutdowns happened in female-dominated fields like child care, retail and hospitality. That's different from past recessions that were harder on men, when male-dominated manufacturing industries collapsed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis time, men had a larger percentage of the jobs that could be done via telecommuting, positioning their careers to survive a pandemic better. By the summer, economists were calling this pandemic's economic crisis the shecession.\\n\\nAnd women saw the already unequal burden of second-shift housework pile even higher. To-go breakfasts and school lunches vanished, and homes became three-meals-a-day mess halls as families went into lockdown — emphasis on the mess.\\n\\nWhen it became clear that most schools weren't going to have students back on campus, another wave of women's job losses hit as they quit their jobs to focus on their homebound children's education and care. In September, 865,000 women left the labor force — more than four times the number of men who left, according to an analysis by the National Women's Law Center.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWomen continue to disproportionately suffer the consequences of the covid-19 pandemic,'' Gema Zamarro, adjunct senior economist for the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research who co-wrote a study on women and covid-19, said in a news release. This could have important implications for the recovery of the economy and represent a significant step back in terms of gender equality.\\n\\nIt's time for the same level of outrage that boiled us when a reality-show star who bragged about grabbing women's genitals took America's highest office, right?\\n\\nFor us, marching is a tactic, a tactic that met the moment, at the time, said Rachel O'Leary Carmona, executive director of the Women's March, when she described the energy and momentum of that day in 2017 when thousands of marchers overwhelmed D.C. in a sea of pink the day after Trump took office.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor us, marching this year didn't meet the moment, Carmona said. That's one of the things we lost, thanks to covid.\\n\\nAnd thanks to the pandemic, women have a magnified set of problems to tackle. Through meetings, coalitions and remote work, the groups involved with the march have found other ways to keep fighting, Carmona said.\\n\\nOnce the pandemic is over, women are going to have to fight their way back into the workforce. The wage gap will have grown, millions of child care slots will have been lost, and the balance of housework will once again be out of whack. No one needs hats and a big street party right now.\\n\\nI'm not really in a partying mood, Carmona said. I'm in a let's-get-to-work-as-quickly-as-possible mood."}
{"original": "Donald Trump, like Obama, campaigned on a pledge to get the United States out of the nation-building business. But when Iraqi leaders demanded that U.S. forces withdraw after Trump ordered the killing in Iraq of a top Iranian military commander, the president's instinct was to describe the crisis in purely mercenary terms: We've spent a lot of money in Iraq, he said. We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. . . . We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it.\\n\\nTrump won the presidency by promising to run the country like a business. He would be the consummate negotiator, driven not by ideology or grand strategy but by his gut, by a plain-spoken, transactional commitment to winning. In this, perhaps more than any other realm, he has fulfilled his promise: He possesses a singular focus on transactions — deals, not relationships; the bottom line, not long-term goals or foundational principles.\\n\\nIn the Middle East, as in Europe, Asia and North America, Trump's approach has hewed closely to his lifelong belief that a person is judged by the deals he makes, by a reckoning of wins and losses. Trump believes he wins because he can be purely transactional, free from the norms, ideologies and traditions that restrain his rivals.\\n\\nTrump has entered a new era of warfare by openly authorizing the assassination of another nation's military leader, using an armed drone, says David Ignatius. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe turned against America's European allies because he thought NATO saddled the United States with way more than its share of the cost of mutual defense. He overturned trade deals such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and then the Iran nuclear pact as well, because he perceived that the United States was giving more than it got in return. He has levied or threatened stiff tariffs on China, the European Union, Turkey and Mexico, arguing that they provide net profits for the United States, even though numerous analyses say they have raised prices for American consumers and cost the country hundreds of thousands of jobs. He argues that North Korea should join the community of nations so it can realize its prime beachfront real estate potential. (Boy, look at that view, he told reporters. Wouldn't that make a great condo?)\\n\\nThe controversy that got Trump impeached began when he wanted to withhold aid from Ukraine, in part because of his long-standing resentment of America's tradition of helping other countries with humanitarian, military and economic aid: Why aren't all of these countries — why aren't they paying? Why is it always the United States that has to pay?\\n\\nPresident Trump said some unspecified NATO member countries have contribute more to meet the alliance's financial benchmarks. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThis is not an attitude he developed when he entered politics. In 1980, Trump gave one of his most revealing interviews, to TV celebrity interviewer Rona Barrett, saying that winning transactions was the core of his life: I think about it literally 24 hours a day, and I really enjoy it. . . . I do understand it's all basically a game. . . . The people that enjoy it are the people that have been winners. Trump views existence as a battle to make the best deals. I really look at life to a certain extent as combat, he said at the time. His first bestseller described dealmaking as his art.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo unified theory of Trump explains his every provocation or impulsive decision. He has said throughout his life that his primary skill and motivation is to be a showman. And he struggles to balance his craving for respect with his desire to win the spotlight, even when it means alienating the very elites and authorities whose respect he seeks. That's why he talks about hiring the best people as aides, yet often turns on advisers who grab the attention of the media.\\n\\nBut Trump's obsession with the bottom line permeates his approach to governing, including his current stance toward Baghdad: We own you. You owe us. We had Iraq, Trump said on Face the Nation last year. We spent a fortune on building this incredible base. We might as well keep it. That idea has stuck with the president, and on Jan. 3, he tweeted that the United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year, for many years. That is on top of all else we have done for them.\\n\\nTrump boils complex issues down to things he can count, said G. Richard Shell, a professor of business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He asks, 'What's the asset here, and how can I get it?' He perceives unequal benefits being exchanged, and he immediately escalates to the highest level of conflict he can see. And then his people signal to him, 'No, no, no,' and he backs off. He backed off on separating families at the Mexican border, and he'll back off on this crisis, Shell said Tuesday. On Wednesday, Trump did just that, delivering a measured address, noting that Iran appears to be standing down and seeking to work together with Tehran on shared priorities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPerhaps counterintuitively, Trump's impulsive attraction to transactional thinking may make him less likely to stumble into a war than more ideologically driven presidents. Many wars have begun because politicians felt they couldn't lose face, Shell said. Trump relishes the unpredictability of his behavior. He would never say, 'My word is sacred to me, I have to pull the trigger.' \\n\\nThe decision to kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani without any apparent plan for managing Iran's inevitable retaliation is typical of how Trump has always operated. He takes pride in acting swiftly and decisively, in the moment. He does not want to hear about antedecents that might inform his decision-making or about how today's decision might alter future options.\\n\\nTrump's attitude toward Iran traces back to the 1979 hostage crisis, the first time the young New York real estate developer opined on national TV about a matter of foreign policy. He focused immediately on the notion of acquiring Iran's oil: That this country sits back and allows a country such as Iran to hold our hostages, to my way of thinking, is a horror, Trump said in the 1980 Barrett interview. If the United States had sent troops to Iran to rescue the American hostages, I think right now we'd be an oil-rich nation, he said, and I believe that we should have done it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's willingness — eagerness, even — to focus on the financial bottom line and then take extreme measures to win, or rather, to be perceived as someone willing to go to extremes, is nothing new. It's how he built his career, positioning himself as a provocateur who would destroy historic landmarks after promising not to do so or threaten to move homeless people into a high-end apartment building to pressure tenants to leave — all in service of higher profits and better deals.\\n\\nResearch on executives who favor transactional deals over enduring business relationships finds that you get better deals and fewer of them with the more impulsive approach, Shell said, but you get many more deals, and they're much more nuanced, if they are based on lasting relationships.\\n\\nIn government, Trump has cycled through a series of top advisers, often frustrated that he hasn't found people he thinks he can trust. Instead, he focuses on the one thing he can always measure — the value of a deal. As Trump put it in a speech in 2004: Watch out for people, even [those] close to you, because in the end, if it's a choice between you and them, they're usually going to choose themselves. . . . You really have to think of yourself as a one-man show.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's great strength — and his frightening emptiness — stem from the same character trait: He lives in the moment and is therefore liberated to take actions that more studious leaders might shy away from. His transactional focus has allowed him to take advantage of Richard Nixon's madman theory, the notion that a president who is willing to be perceived as tough, unpredictable and even unhinged can force an enemy to make concessions for fear of suffering an immoderate attack. Threatening to bomb Iran's cultural sites, and then backing away after his own defense secretary said it would be a war crime, comes easily to a president who cares mainly about winning the moment. Transaction complete, he moves on to the next deal with the slate clean, at least in his own mind."}

{"original": "It might have seemed like a harbinger of what's to come: This Democratic primary contest is, after all, a historic race for American Jews. The other man in the Two-Man Race for the Nomination is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), an avowed democratic socialist and another Jew, who looks like the front-runner after coasting through the first three contests, itself a historic feat for a Jewish candidate. The faceoff between the Jewish billionaire and the Jewish socialist is the most Jewish political moment in American history, and predictions have abounded that a wave of hatred is about to hit as the two gain steam, evoking mythological anti-Semitic creatures to rapacious anti-Semites: The Elder of Zion and the Judeo-Bolshevik in a race for control of America! The Daily Stormer headlines write themselves.\\n\\nI'm not as worried. To me, Cruz's infelicitous tweet read like the kind of unfortunate mistake you make when you forget someone is Jewish, rather than when you target them for it. While Jews may see two 78-year-old Jewish men running against each other (arguing about who's had more stents and who has more houses, like at the kiddush in a Conservative shul), that's not how America writ large perceives this race. Sanders and Bloomberg are barely registering in mainstream politics as Jewish. It's a remarkable, final gift from the goldeneh medinah — the golden land, as Yiddish-speaking immigrants once called the United States — at a time when American Jews have never needed it more.\\n\\nTake, for example, the recent vandalism of Bloomberg's campaign offices with epithets including racist, sexist, oligarch and corporate pig. Yes, Bloomberg is Jewish, and yes, some of the insults were about his wealth, but none of the graffiti was anti-Semitic. The hatred seemingly fueling the vandalism was based on class warfare, not race or religion; the vandals clearly didn't target Bloomberg as a Jew but as a billionaire, and well, they apparently believe it's time to Eat the Rich, as they spray-painted on the Flint, Mich., headquarters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe vandalism is just the most extreme example of something true across the board when it comes to Bloomberg: Most of the criticism he faces, aside from censure over the racist stop-and-frisk policy he instituted as mayor, focuses on his staggering wealth and how he's used it to buy power and influence. That is a familiar Jewish stereotype, yet it's not anti-Semitic in this case because Bloomberg's Jewishness is completely irrelevant; he's accused of these things not because he's Jewish but because he's Bloomberg. Anti-Semitic canards are based on generalizations and myths. This critique is specific.\\n\\nSanders, too, seems to exist in the American imagination independent from his Jewishness. Take the myriad articles exploring his popularity among Latinos, many of whom call him Tío Bernie, the articles tell us, despite the fact that he is a white, 78-year-old senator from Vermont. The mystery these articles seek to solve is never how young Latinos could identify with an old Jew or even an old white Jew, but how they could identify with an old white guy and how they came to claim him as one of their own. The narrative erases Sanders's Jewish identity.\\n\\nThey're not the only ones. The controversial radio host Joe Rogan, whose approval of Sanders the campaign turned into an ad, apparently had no idea that Sanders was Jewish. His critics, too, seem to focus almost exclusively on seeing him as too far to the left, portending bread lines and class warfare — accusations that are completely separate from his Jewish identity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Sanders's two campaigns for president, the only anti-Semitic episode I can recall involved an unfortunate article in Politico that depicted him in an illustration standing next to a tree of $100 bills and quoted someone calling him cheap; it was another accidental slur that seemed to come from overlooking Sanders's heritage rather than attacking it — like Cruz's tweet, or when Chris Matthews compared Sanders's victory in the Nevada caucuses last weekend to the Nazis marching into France. (I'm sorry for comparing anything from that tragic era in which so many suffered, especially the Jewish people, to an electoral result in which you were the ­well-deserved winner, a contrite Matthews said in an apology a few days later.)\\n\\nAnd though a debate question Tuesday night sought to tie Sanders's potential to be the first Jewish president to his decision to skip the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's annual conference, the connection was strained (which Sanders seemed to realize; after noting that he is very proud of being Jewish, he quickly pivoted to a broader critique of U.S. Middle East policy).\\n\\nNone of this is to say that Sanders isn't Jewish enough, a noxious idea floating around far-right Jewish circles. His Jewish identity, rooted in the evil of the Holocaust and the murder of his father's family by the Nazis, chimes with that of many American Jews, and I believe him when he says he is proud to be Jewish.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the fact that Sanders and Bloomberg are Jewish is something Americans barely seem to notice about them; it's simply receded into the background of their bids for the presidency. Each candidate has been allowed to bring his Jewishness to the fore exactly as often as he would like and not a jot more.\\n\\nThis is an amazing fact, the true revolutionary aspect of this election cycle. In the parlance of our times, you might say they're demonstrating that most coveted of American commodities: white privilege. Sanders and Bloomberg are able to simply blend into the mostly old, mostly male, mostly white Democratic field. That didn't happen for Cory Booker or Kamala Harris, or for Julián Castro or Andrew Yang, or for Elizabeth Warren, or Hillary Clinton in 2016, for that matter. For women and other minorities, race and gender are still inseparable from public persona. They don't get to decide how they are seen; America sees them first and foremost as women or black or Latino or Asian.\\n\\nNot so for white Jewish men anymore. The America that accepted Joe Lieberman keeping kosher and observing Shabbat on the campaign trail in 2000 has gone a step further: In 2020, amid a rise in anti-Semitic vandalism and violence, two white Jews are able to run not on the Jewishness that unites them but on what distinguishes them from each other — which, because God has a sense of humor, is their approach to money.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt turns out that in addition to gifting Jews the right to practice their religion freely, America had one more gift: the right to make our Jewishness disappear to our fellow citizens.\\n\\nWe have a long way to go to ensure that the rest of America's minorities — including Jews of color and visibly Orthodox Jews — have the same choice. Still, there's something magical in the spectacle of two Jews fighting over money before a nation that sees only two Americans. It reflects the fulfillment of liberal democracy's promise: that it can ultimately grant a minority group full access to the rights and privileges of the majority, not by forcing them to abandon their identity but allowing them to choose how much to let it define them. When America lives up to its ideals, anyone can show up in the public sphere with just as much of their personal, religious, even national identity as they like, and no one — not the government, nor public opinion — can force a lick more of it onto them.\\n\\nBecause we are Jews, we naturally prepare for the worst. Many are already steeling themselves against the possibility of an anti-Semitic onslaught the likes of which we've never seen before, declaring this election cycle catnip to anti-Semites of every creed and color. Certainly, it's possible that the Democratic primary race is a friendlier space for Jewish politicians than the general election will be; President Trump, after all, ran an anti-Semitic ad while running against Hillary Clinton, who isn't Jewish.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut I hope that in the midst of those preparations for the worst, we remember to stop and behold the wonder of this moment and recommit to ensuring that all Americans are granted the gifts America has bestowed upon us Jews in campaigns to come — swiftly and in our lifetimes."}

(The Washington Post is a member of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, one of the groups involved in the coalition.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGoogle's stated goal is to make the Web less infuriating to navigate. It's clear that annoying ads degrade what we all love about the Web, Chrome Vice President Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said in a company blog post Tuesday.\\n\\nUsing the coalition's standards, Google will evaluate the advertisements on websites and rate them as acceptable or failing. Sites rated failing then have 30 days to shape up their advertising and submit themselves for reevaluation or face having their ads blocked by Chrome.\\n\\nGoogle said it has so far identified 1,500 of the Internet's most-trafficked sites with ads that violate the new standards. About 850 of those have a failing status — meaning that they could see their ads blocked within the next 30 days.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPublishers are the most likely to take an initial hit from Google's ad changes, said Peter Reinhardt, chief executive of the Segment customer data platform. Media companies have been more aggressive about the types of advertisements they use, he said, as Google and Facebook have tightened their hold on the digital ad industry. The two Internet giants reaped 60 percent of the country's digital advertising dollars in 2017, according to the research firm eMarketer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGoogle's move with Chrome follows Apple's decision in June to put features addressing online advertising into its Safari browser. However, Reinhardt said, the companies' approaches to ad blocking are quite different. Apple's is targeting advertisers who track users across the Web and compile data, rather than blocking the appearance of ads. Reinhardt said that since the Safari change, some advertisers' revenue has fallen as much as 20 percent.\\n\\nGoogle, meanwhile, is aimed at changing how websites look and behave when people are using them. It also offers an alternative to third-party ad-blockers — which often block both ads and trackers — that may be more palatable to Google and other companies that make money from advertising. By addressing the ads that Google surveys have found to be most annoying, Chrome's tool may persuade Internet users not to take more drastic options to hide or eliminate all online ads from their screens.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAn Internet free of tracking and ads is obviously not Google's endgame. After all, the company makes most of its money through advertising — more than $95 billion last year. And while some see this as reforming the ad industry from the inside, Google is fielding criticism for the way the blocker is being implemented.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome note that the company had a lot of say in writing the standards, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

Giggling with excitement at skipping out on Friday classes, they join a host of others assembled near the terminal. Native American drummers and dancers rouse the crowd, and there's a festive feeling in the air. But this is no festival. The message these young people have come to send to their city, to their state, to the nation — to the world of adults — is serious. Deadly serious. We won't die from old age, reads one of the signs they hoist above their heads. We'll die from climate change.\\n\\nHigh school sophomore Sophie Kaplan is marching in a bright yellow flowered sundress, but the sentiment on her poster is hardly so sunny: Why Should I Study For a Future I Won't Have? She thinks about climate change every day, she tells me. She reads about how we're on the brink and hears her teachers and parents tell her that it's up to her generation to fix things. I don't understand why I should be in school if the world is burning, she says. What's the point of working on my education if we don't deal with this first?\\n\\nAs the estimated 7,500 marchers converge on the state capitol, I come upon Chris Bray and his children, sixth-grader Arianna and second-grader Colin. Dressed in plaid shorts and blue sunglasses, Colin hovers shyly behind a homemade sign (a picture of coal with the word Why? and a shining sun with the words Why not?). The boy is scared about the planet, he tells me, but it feels good to be surrounded by so many other people who care, since he can sometimes feel as if nobody else is worried.\\n\\nClimate change, say Chris and his wife, Amber, is a big topic of discussion in their home. Colin and Arianna have always shown an interest in the environment. They've cried over nature documentaries about the destruction of the coral reefs and sought out coverage of 17-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.\\n\\nChris and Amber are proud that their children are so aware, and of the way their kids' interest has informed their own actions. But at the same time, like many parents, they're concerned that their children could be overwhelmed by predictions about the environment that seem to be growing ever more dire.\\n\\nThe United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in 2018 that policymakers have just 12 years to avert the worst consequences of global warming; news coverage is constantly filled with apocalyptic stories of storms and wildfires. Young people, absorbing the gravity of these warnings, have become the defining face of the climate movement — marching, protesting and berating their elders for bequeathing them an uncertain, unstable future. Underlying their anger, though, is another a-word: anxiety. And it's something they're increasingly voicing. Teachers hear their students talk about panic attacks when wildfires break out, and psychologists face young patients weeping about their fear of never having a family. Amber Bray recalls Colin solemnly telling her on his eighth birthday, My life would be better without climate change.\\n\\nHow to handle such fears? The adult world seems unsure, at best. The Brays, for their part, think it's important to work through the anguish and keep talking to their kids. We've decided to be open and honest. They have feelings, we validate them, Chris says. At the same time, he admits, It's sad, it's hard.\\n\\nAs climate change continues unabated, parents, teachers and medical professionals across the country find themselves face-to-face with a quandary: How do you raise a generation to look toward the future with hope when all around them swirls a message of apparent hopelessness? How do you prepare today's children for a world defined by environmental trauma without inflicting more trauma yourself? And where do you find the line between responsible education and undue alarmism?\\n\\nStudents and others at a climate change protest in New York in May. Photo by Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\\n\\nThe nexus between climate change and the mental health of children is rarely at the forefront of the discussion around environmental politics, but it's very real: In a Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll of American teenagers released in September, 57 percent said that climate change made them feel scared and 52 percent said it made them feel angry, both higher rates than among adults. Just 29 percent of teens said they were optimistic. Reports like the U.S. government's National Climate Assessment have cited mental health concerns as a side effect of climate change. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement in 2015 warning that climate change poses threats to children's mental and physical health, and that failure to take prompt, substantive action would be an act of injustice to all children.\\n\\nIn expert testimony for the plaintiffs from 2018 in Juliana v. United States — a lawsuit filed by a number of young people seeking to force the U.S. government to adopt policies to fight climate change and end fossil fuel subsidies — psychiatrist Lise van Susteren wrote that children will be at the center of the storm as climate change worsens and that they may already be feeling mental health impacts. Day in and day out worrying about the unprecedented scale of the risk posed by climate change ... takes a heavy toll on an individual's well-being, wearing them down, sending some to the 'breaking point,'  she wrote. Children are especially vulnerable. Those words, she told me, were really painful to write. Interviewing children about their fears for nature and their worries about their future families, she says, left her with a sense of shame.\\n\\nEco-anxiety or climate depression is playing out in real terms among young people, sometimes in extreme ways: A 2008 study in an Australian medical journal chronicled the case of a 17-year-old boy who was hospitalized after refusing to drink water during a nationwide drought, in what the authors called the first case of climate change delusion. A psychiatrist I interviewed told me a patient had confessed that she secretly wished a pandemic would strike to ease stress on the planet.\\n\\nBut the anxiety can manifest in subtler ways as well. Sarah Niles, an 18-year-old from Alabama, told me that her fears about climate change have simply become a part of her life. I feel like in my peer group, you just go right from talking about polar bears dying to 'Did you see what Maya posted on Snapchat?' Nobody has a filter to adjust, Niles says. It's like, the ice caps are melting and my hypothetical children will never see them, but also I have a calculus test tomorrow.\\n\\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, nearly 1 in 3 people ages 13 to 18 experience an anxiety disorder, and a study published in April 2018 in the Journal of Development and Behavioral Pediatrics found that anxiety diagnoses in children ages 6 to 17 increased 20 percent between 2007 and 2012. There's no single cause: A nonstop barrage of social media, a heightened political climate and the threat of school shootings are all stressors. And that's on top of being a teenager, with all the tumult that entails.\\n\\nBut the often apocalyptic nature of the news about climate change is perhaps uniquely paralyzing. Elizabeth Haase, a psychiatrist in Nevada, describes how some of her patients can be overwhelmed by the scale of the problem: I'm supposed to be emotionally hopeful in a hopeless situation, and I'm supposed to act powerful when the source of power is collective power and it's overwhelming, and I'm supposed to feel faith and do things to be sustainable when nature is declining around me. Overcome by a sense of powerlessness, they simply feel stuck in a situation, with no way out.\\n\\nIt's like, the ice caps are melting and my hypothetical children will never see them, but also I have a calculus test tomorrow, says Sarah Niles, an 18-year-old from Alabama.\\n\\n(Janelle Barone for The Washington Post)\\n\\nPark Guthrie knows about this paralysis in climate-change-spooked kids. A sixth-grade teacher in Sonoma County, Calif., he has seen the toll that the state's raging wildfires can take on the generally enthusiastic 11- and 12-year-olds in his classes. He has witnessed panic attacks triggered by the mere smell of smoke. When smoke from a nearby controlled burn once drifted to the school, he recalls, one boy smiled blankly and announced, I think I'm having PTSD. Last year, after the Kincade Fire burned nearly 78,000 acres in the county in late October, Guthrie found himself, not for the first time, comforting students worried about their homes and their relatives.\\n\\nGuthrie understands how much climate change troubles his students, but he doesn't shy from talking about it. He confronts not only their fears, but also the political reality of denial and decades of inaction, all of which is disturbing to his students. It's like there's a paradigm shift, like when you learn that Santa Claus isn't real, he says. Everything we teach them, that science is a tool for understanding the world, that adults are protecting you, falls apart. There's nothing to prepare them for this enormous problem that we simply haven't solved.\\n\\nAn Army brat who lived as a high schooler in Berlin, Guthrie recalls going to East Berlin to watch a tribute to the Berlin Wall, a Communist display of propaganda. Back then, it made him believe that the wall would never come down, but today he realizes how much that fictional exercise reinforced the wall's symbolic power. Now, he fears that by not speaking up forcefully about climate change as a generational issue, institutions are propping up this fictional story that you can care for kids in our country while neglecting or ignoring the climate. As a teacher, Guthrie is a mandated reporter, someone legally required to speak up about signs of child abuse and neglect. If climate change will harm his students and is causing them anguish, isn't silence on the issue a violation of that duty?\\n\\nGuthrie has taken his views national as the co-founder of the nonprofit Schools for Climate Action (S4CA), which asks schools and other educational groups to pass resolutions highlighting the effects of climate change on children. Since December 2017, more than 100 resolutions have been passed, 66 by school boards and 29 by student councils. Many set sustainability goals or call on Congress to take climate action. Most are shepherded by students, who write the resolutions with the help of administrators and school board members.\\n\\nThough they don't commit organizations to any specific action, the resolutions send a signal that there are support networks for students struggling with climate change. They also bolster the idea that students can at least make a difference by raising awareness: Jordyn Bauer, a 20-year-old sophomore at California's Sonoma State University who worked to pass a resolution in her California school district in 2018, said it helped validate her ability to do something. Too many people are just standing by, she says. I felt like it was my responsibility to take charge.\\n\\nNot everyone, however, is on board with Guthrie's agenda. Last spring, Guthrie and a number of S4CA partners — including several students — lobbied the National Association of School Psychologists to adopt a resolution stating that climate change is a children's issue, as the group's California chapter had done. But the organization declined. The group's executive director, Kathleen Minke, responded in an email to Guthrie that her group focuses on issues that have a very direct impact on schools, student learning and children's mental and behavioral health. Climate change, she said, falls outside this professional focus. When I interviewed her later, Minke told me that her organization isn't ignoring climate change and has dedicated resources to help school psychologists deal with kids affected by natural disasters. But when it comes to managing anxiety, their focus is on coping, not causes. You're not going to develop an entire curriculum around anxiety related to 'x,'  she says. There are too many x's for that to be efficient.\\n\\nLikewise, S4CA's efforts to get national school board groups to lobby on climate change have come up short. Chris Ungar has been a school board member for 20 years in California's San Luis Coastal Unified School District. Last spring, he proposed language to the National School Boards Association recognizing climate change as a threat and asking Congress for funding to help schools affected by natural disasters. It easily passed a policy committee, but before the full association the resolution was, in Ungar's words, gutted — the climate change language stripped because delegates from some states worried that it could obscure the natural-disaster funding request.\\n\\nThat outcome underscored one of the biggest barriers to Guthrie's work: Education and youth groups don't always see climate change as having a direct link to children if they're not being displaced by a disaster — and sometimes not even then. Still, more schools have picked up the S4CA resolution model, and in September, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) introduced a nonbinding resolution acknowledging climate change as a social justice issue and supporting more climate education. By failing to address climate change in a meaningful way, we are failing our children, she said in a floor speech, and they know it.\\n\\nThe People's Climate March in New York in September. (Andrew Burton/Getty Images)\\n\\nAlthough there's little question that climate change will harm younger generations, there's considerably more debate about a related concern — that the rhetoric surrounding the issue is equally injurious. When young people seize on the U.N. warning that governments need to take action in 12 years to conclude, incorrectly, that the planet has only a decade remaining (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said last year that millennials fear the world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change), or when the website of the U.K.-based activist group Extinction Rebellion warns that societal collapse and mass death are seen as inevitable by scientists and other credible voices, it can be terrifying. Some voices are now sounding the alarm about alarmism, suggesting that we'd all be better off if we dialed down some of the hyperbole.\\n\\nThis message of 'We're all going to die, how dare you say there might be something we can do' ... that's just not supported by the science, says Kate Marvel, a climate scientist and mathematician at Columbia University. I'm not saying we can all rest, and I'm not saying we live in the best of all possible worlds. But one can have a sense of optimism by working towards a solution.\\n\\nMany of the adults I talked to said the heightened rhetoric around climate change reminded them of the panic around nuclear weapons during the Cold War, when school lessons were interrupted by duck and cover drills and there was perpetual fear that the world might end at any moment. The 1983 TV movie The Day After, which dramatized the fallout from a nuclear attack on the Midwest, emerged as an apocalyptic touchstone; surveys after the film aired found viewers were more depressed about their chances of survival and were less optimistic about their ability to influence nuclear weapons policy.\\n\\nMichael Shellenberger, an author and founder of the California-based nonprofit Environmental Progress, which promotes nuclear energy, remembers how panicked he felt after watching the movie. Now, he considers it bizarre that adults would have decided to traumatize teenagers with that. Today, he says, some in the environmental movement are making climate change the new apocalypse.\\n\\nThese scenarios of apocalypse, of really cataclysmic climate change that people are scaring children around, are in the realm of an extreme, unpredictable event, he told me. He has reflected on eco-anxiety while observing his 14-year-old daughter and her friends grow more worried about the planet; his book on the topic, Apocalypse Never, is due out in June. He's not advocating that children be shielded from the science, but rather that it be presented seriously. The headline-grabbing threats of mass extinctions and deaths may motivate action, he says, but at what cost?\\n\\nWe have people that know the power of fear manipulate consciously the psychology of young people in a way that is wrong and should stop, he argues. What people need to understand is that there are extreme scenarios ... and they are not the same thing as predictive science. Indeed, scientists say that while some warming is baked in, action now could avert the worst consequences. Marvel puts it this way: There are so many futures between doomed and fine.\\n\\nEven the lower end of that range of futures, however, can mean destructive storms, displacement and economic upheaval, and that's the reality that teachers have to communicate. To Meghan Duffy, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan, the climate change lecture in her introductory biology course is the most important class she teaches. But, worried that the class might be overwhelming or not communicated well, she surveyed her students for a study published in 2019. After the climate change lesson, students knew more but felt worse: Only 4 percent of the class thought humans would successfully address climate change. One student wrote in an anonymous survey, I understand that global warming is an important part of learning from this class, but at some point one of the lectures gave me an anxiety attack, so that wasn't fun.\\n\\nStudying that emotional response forced Duffy to reevaluate her syllabus. This past fall, she added a second lesson about solutions, highlighting the drop in the cost of renewable energy and improvements in battery technology for storing clean energy. It's a strategy Duffy says is necessary for any climate communicator, but especially one working with young minds. There's a danger in having the instruction emphasize climate catastrophe, she says. It's tempting to say how bad things are, how much we need to stop it. But at some point you've accidentally said this is a foregone conclusion. We can overemphasize how scary it is to the point where people feel hopeless and panicked.\\n\\nWorking toward a solution, in fact, is the consensus approach to calming young people's fears about the future. The key to addressing eco-anxiety at any age, says psychiatrist Haase, is getting unstuck, losing that feeling of paralysis in the face of the problem's magnitude. Haase is a founding member of the Climate Psychiatry Alliance, an ad hoc group that has sprung up to offer patients and doctors advice on discussing climate anxiety. It's one of a number of such groups that are tackling the growing rate of patients panicked about the state of the world: The Good Grief Network was launched in 2016 to offer group counseling sessions to the climate-anxious.\\n\\nThe emphasis, doctors say, should be on personal responsibility and empowerment. For an overwhelming problem like climate change, being able to take some action — whether eating less meat or switching to an electric vehicle — can help fight paralysis and get patients to recognize that the worst of climate change is not a fait accompli and that some progress can be made. Haase says patients can often end up at one of two poles: one focused on catastrophe, the other essentially ignoring the problem. Recognizing the middle space can open up your thoughts. By going back and forth, it creates a larger space for you to think in and feel in, she explains, and out of that come innovative solutions.\\n\\nEverything we teach them, that science is a tool for understanding the world, that adults are protecting you, falls apart, says California teacher Park Guthrie.\\n\\nAs the ones usually tasked with bringing climate change information to their students, teachers are increasingly taking on the weight of the psychological implications. Lisa Balazs, a science teacher at a private school outside Birmingham, Ala., told me she persuaded her school to offer a specialized climate change class last year. She wanted to walk students through the physics and chemistry of the changing climate, but also focus on solutions. I wanted them to feel like they were empowered in the way you could have an intelligent conversation, she says. The scary part is feeling like there's nothing you individually can do, especially when you look at the government. So turning it around and putting it back in your personal control, this is what you can vote for and work for.\\n\\nBalazs highlighted how politicians even in her conservative state have promoted clean energy, and she encouraged her students to take political action. Sarah Niles, who took Balazs's class as a senior, says it was inspiring to learn about solutions to climate change, especially since, so often, the subject felt like devastation with no hope. She recalls days after class where we would go to the common room and just sit because we didn't know what to do. Now, she's taking a gap year before college and volunteering in Rockport, Tex., to help rebuild the community, which was devastated by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. It's a way, she says, to put a face and a name to things you learn about in class, and feel as if she's making a small difference.\\n\\nOf course, before you can bring up solutions, you have to be able to bring up climate change at all. Schools, however, have sometimes been slow to bring climate change into the classroom, especially in conservative areas. Lawmakers in states such as Florida and Texas have pushed bills that would strip climate change from curriculums entirely. In Pennsylvania's Central Bucks School District in 2017, a Republican school board member used fears about rising anxiety among the young in lobbying to remove textbooks that discussed climate change.\\n\\nMoreover, many teachers are unequipped to deal with it. A survey from the National Center for Science Education and Penn State's Survey Research Center during the 2014-15 school year found that fewer than half of the teachers responding had taken a formal course on climate change. The same survey found that only two-thirds of teachers said they emphasize that human activity is the primary driver of climate change, despite the scientific consensus that humans are the cause. (Jeanne Kaidy, a high school science teacher in Rochester, N.Y., told me she gets a distressing amount of pushback from students and teachers disputing the science.)\\n\\nBut many teachers told me they're supported by the Next Generation Science Standards, written in 2013 to overhaul science teaching. Created by officials from 26 states and several national science education organizations, the standards take climate change as a given, expecting students to be taught that human activities contribute to global warming and that the phenomenon is having a dire effect on human life. They also go deep on solutions, such as clean energy. So far, though, only 20 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, although 24 other states have drawn up their own guidance based on them.\\n\\nRenee Belisle, a curriculum specialist for Denver Public Schools, says that the standards, which passed narrowly in Colorado, have played a hugely significant role in a rewrite of the district's high school science curriculum, which now integrates climate change into biology, physics and chemistry classes. Each climate change unit contains an action item; as early as middle school, students are taught that steps such as changing your diet or turning off the lights can have an effect. That arc of ending with the empowerment is a way to help mitigate that pessimism that could develop, Belisle says, particularly with kids, who might feel disenfranchised.\\n\\nStudents take a break after marching during the Youth Climate Strike in Boston in September. (Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\\n\\nAnd yet the seemingly best approach — making young people feel enfranchised to deal with climate change — comes with both upsides and potential downsides. On the one hand, what better way for young people to process climate change worries than to pressure adults to actually do something about the crisis? Campaigns like the youth-led Sunrise Movement, founded in 2017, have pursued this strategy, placing young people on the front lines of the fight over the Green New Deal; the group gained Internet notoriety in February 2019 with a video of students, some as young as 11, confronting Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California over her lack of support for the plan.\\n\\nOn the other hand, high schoolers are still high schoolers, with homework and soccer practice and dates and part-time jobs. And teenagers I spoke with admitted that activism can be a burden. I'd love to not be doing this. I'd much rather be hanging out with my friends, watching something stupid on Netflix, says Jonah Gottlieb, 17, a high school senior in California. I have to because adults have left us no choice.\\n\\nThat feeling of responsibility, of being let down by prior generations, permeated the conversations I had — and there probably isn't a good solution, aside from actually solving climate change itself. For now, parents are left to walk a tightrope between being honest and being comforting, between empowering their kids and weighing them down with the responsibility of saving the world.\\n\\nThe Bray family, at least, is erring on the side of not underplaying the situation — or the need for everyone to contribute to solutions. Amber Bray recalls the day the U.N. panel issued its 12-year warning. When Arianna came home from school, Amber told me, she hugged her daughter tight and, with tears in her eyes, apologized. Both said that day changed their perspective and rallied the family to work harder to reduce its environmental impact. Some parents might think they should shield their children from the realities, Amber says. I believe it's my job as a parent to prepare my children to be ready, make good choices, be part of the solution. It's a disservice to our children if we don't teach them about life's dangers and how to protect themselves, even as we pray it is never necessary.\\n\\nJason Plautz is a writer in Denver.\\n\\nPhoto editing by Dudley M.

Bowser (D) often says, those who have been here five generations or five minutes.\\n\\nMore than 1,300 people who want to make their homes along D.C.'s North Capitol Street will have to wait years more. And 400 people may never have the chance to live in the Brookland neighborhood after a pair of court decisions last year.\\n\\nRising demand for walkable places near jobs, Metro and suburban town centers has meant rising prices, threatening the ability of even affluent families to find a good place to live. Our most vulnerable residents face even steeper hurdles as cheaper rental housing disappears under market pressures.\\n\\nThat is why a coalition of organizations — from tenants' groups and faith groups to nonprofit and for-profit developers — united in asking the D.C. government to plan effectively for housing current and future residents as it revises the D.C. Comprehensive Plan.\\n\\nThe challenges of providing needed housing and the need to fix the Comprehensive Plan have become even greater with recent court decisions sending back for further hearings two significant development projects: 901 Monroe Street and the McMillan sand filtration site.\\n\\nBoth developments had exhaustive community input, public hearings, multiple votes at the D.C. Zoning Commission and significant compromises with neighbors, plus, for McMillan, a lengthy historic-preservation process and multiple votes at the D.C. Council. Now the court decisions have delayed them by years at best, indefinitely at worst.\\n\\nBoth projects would add to the District's stock of below-market-rate affordable housing. McMillan also would create medical office space, a grocery store, more shops and a park.\\n\\nThe two decisions represented a U-turn in D.C. jurisprudence. The courts had previously been more deferential to the D.C. Zoning Commission, a hybrid federal-local body that makes the final decision on many large development projects. And these reversals may not be the last: Responding to the unexpected victories in these two cases, opponents have begun appealing approved developments across the city.\\n\\nNobody but the judges involved can say for sure why they changed their attitudes toward new housing, but one passage in the McMillan case is instructive: The judges seized on opponents' fears of gentrification, despite this not being at issue at the zoning hearings. Presumably they, like most Washingtonians, have read plenty in the news about the real human toll of rising rents and housing prices.\\n\\nBut make no mistake: Not building a building doesn't help a low-income person find a place to live. Nobody has ever found a home because a court kept a vacant lot vacant. Only new mixed-income housing, preserving existing affordable housing, protecting tenants and policies that create jobs can alleviate displacement.\\n\\nThat is why a group of more than 20 organizations and businesses started meeting last year to find areas of agreement around these thorny issues. Some were for-profit developers such as JBG and EYA; others were advocates for tenants who have tangled with for-profit developers, such as the Latino Economic Development Center. The coalition included affordable-housing advocates, faith groups and policy analysts.\\n\\nThese groups haven't always agreed on policy issues. But all could agree, quite simply, that to be truly inclusive, the District needs more housing, more affordable housing and targeted support for communities affected by the District's changes. They agree that a building unbuilt helps no one and support finding policies that help all.\\n\\nThey came together to ask for changes to the Comprehensive Plan, a massive document that guides the District's growth and change, particularly around development. Despite its physical heft, though, the document is full of holes. The D.C. Court of Appeals judges focused on inconsistency in the Comprehensive Plan when remanding the 901 Monroe and McMillan cases.\\n\\nIndeed, the Comprehensive Plan is itself a problem: It says everything and thus nothing. It says the District should be more inclusive, needs more housing and should pursue infill development, especially near Metro stations. But it also says neighborhoods should be protected against change, with maps that don't reflect the policy priorities in the rest of the plan. It bobs and weaves and hedges in an effort to please everyone so that anyone can find arguments to support or oppose any project in its pages.\\n\\nIf the District is to grow inclusively, it must clarify the priorities in the Comprehensive Plan. The coalition has negotiated 10 principles, including meet the housing demand, equitably distribute housing, include families and preserve existing affordable housing.\\n\\nWe hope more residents and organizations will join in and D.C. officials will commit to a Comprehensive Plan that puts these principles first so that new housing could be created, affordable housing could be preserved, judges could be unconfused and the vision of an inclusive D.C. could be achieved.\\n\\nThe writer is founder and president of Greater Greater Washington."}

The party cannot embrace characters who bring bad-faith challenges to an election, thereby destroying our constitutional fabric, nor those who would excuse or overlook Trump's appalling but failed election heist.\\n\\nIf Republicans want to recover from the Trump calamity, they must start, as Republicans once did with the KKK and the John Birchers, by throwing out the radicals who would do harm to our democracy.

The Justice Department found no evidence of irregularity sufficient to overturn the election. Pointing to the most egregious self-promoter and disingenuous member of the Senate (for which the competition is stiff), Romney says, My fellow Senator Ted Cruz and the co-signers of his statement argue that rejection of electors or an election audit directed by Congress would restore trust in the election. Nonsense. . . . This has the predictable potential to lead to disruption, and worse. He concludes, I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle? (He is new around there, isn't he?)\\n\\nAnd consider the admonition from Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa): The effort by Senators Hawley, Cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like Pennsylvania directly undermines the right to elect our leaders, he said in a written statement on Monday. The senators justify their intent by observing that there have been many allegations of fraud. But allegations of fraud by a losing campaign cannot justify overturning an election.

Allowing them to caucus with the rest of the party, handing them committee chairs and carrying out the charade that they ever operate apart from self-interest would be to affirm that the GOP plainly has no standards and tolerates seditious actors.\\n\\nLook at it differently: This is the perfect time for concerned Republicans (and certainly ones with presidential aspirations) to shed the party's Trumpian yoke. They can finally say they broke with Trump (albeit days before he leaves office). As a bonus, they can jettison some of the most obnoxious and ignorant members of Congress. The egregious nature of these members' offense creates the perfect bright-line test for membership in one of the two national parties: patriots on one side, seditionists on the other. The non-seditious part of the GOP will never have a better shot at washing off the stink of the Trump era than it does right now.\\n\\nThis is how the GOP could survive: It must cut out the cancer on the party so the party can go forward and reinvigorate itself with new, sensible policies and values it once held (objective reality being my favorite). It can excise the lawless nihilism that threatens to blot out any policy or value Republicans might hope to advance. If the GOP does not act, the threat will metastasize, bringing down the whole lot of them."}

After returning to the United States, she won plaudits as a lawyer working with immigrant Muslim women who were seeking refuge from domestic abuse, part of two decades of charity work.\\n\\nSchubert said that background makes it so hard to understand what came next. In early September, Ayaz and her two sons were found fatally shot in their house in Herndon, Va. Police are still investigating but say they think Ayaz, 42, killed the boys and then herself.\\n\\nSchubert said she is haunted by the case. So are some members of Ayaz's family and community, who are still reeling and trying to fit together pieces that don't seem to match. Her family said she left no note.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI cannot reconcile the Noera I knew with the tragic story of her death, Schubert wrote in an email.\\n\\nThe case is all the more unusual because it breaks a grim mold. About 90 percent of the perpetrators who carried out murder-suicides in the first half of 2017 were men, and the majority of the victims were wives or girlfriends, according to the most recent data on the phenomenon by the Violence Policy Center. Cases in which mothers kill their children are rare.\\n\\nThe weeks since the deaths have provided some clues, but much remains murky. Fairfax County police have not released a motive, and Ayaz's husband, the sole surviving member of the immediate family, said he is not ready to talk and has not shared key details with Noera's relatives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat has left people like Schubert and Yasir Ayaz, Noera Ayaz's brother, to try to figure out answers. Yasir Ayaz said he wishes he had access to the police report and his sister's journal, but police said those items can be shared only by her husband, who is her official next of kin.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI want to understand what happened, Ayaz said. There are other families that might be going through such things. If some of the evidence becomes clear, you can help some of these families. We can't reverse the situation that occurred, but we can try to prevent similar situations.\\n\\nAyaz said he learned after Noera's death that she had been suffering from depression and had been in treatment for about six months. He said she was taking antidepressants. She also had stopped responding to his texts and phone calls in the weeks before the shootings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAyaz Lari, Noera and Yasir's father, had visited the family in recent months and had a pleasant time. He recalled Noera's sons, Tihami, 11, and Miraaj, 9, beating their grandparents at chess.\\n\\nThey were even brighter than Noera, Lari said. I couldn't believe it, they were so smart.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe last time Lari talked to his daughter in the weeks before her death, she told him she wasn't feeling well and had been working late nights. Her husband also called with concerns about her mental health, but Lari said the depth of her problems remained masked.\\n\\nI had no idea what was cooking, Lari said.\\n\\nThat veil carried right through the day of the killings. Yasir Ayaz said that on Sept. 5, his sister went out to lunch with her husband and some friends at Taco Bell. Nothing seemed amiss, but Lari said he now knows that his daughter had purchased the gun used in the killings the day before.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLari said that on the evening of Sept. 5, he received a call from his son-in-law after he arrived home from work. I see the children in blood, Lari said the husband told him. I'm going to call 911.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen officers arrived, they found Ayaz in an upstairs bathroom. First responders attempted to revive the children, but the mother and sons were pronounced dead.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, Ayaz's husband and relatives put out a statement saying they were shocked and devastated.\\n\\nNoera was a devoted mother, a dedicated attorney, and a champion for the rights of women everywhere, it said. Noera will be remembered for her warmth, wisdom, and artistic spirit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHer husband and family set up a charity fund that has raised about $10,000. Murder-suicides are often met by public silence, but the Web page for the fund has drawn an outpouring of support.\\n\\nNoera Ayaz lived a noble and generous life, one donor said. Another offered, What I learned from her will always live in my heart, and another said that Ayaz was an inspiration to many.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAyaz had been the director of Women in Islam, a group that worked to empower Muslim women. Lari said his daughter had spent two decades largely doing charity work for various organizations, including most recently for Just Neighbors in Annandale, Va.\\n\\nBefore that, she worked in intellectual property law for the firm Baker Botts. Her father said she had worked for former secretary of state James A. Baker after he stepped down from public life. She also traveled widely.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is little research on women who carry out murder-suicides because the overwhelming number of such perpetrators are men. David Adams, co-director of Emerge, a domestic-violence counseling program in Massachusetts, said men and women engage in the acts for different reasons.\\n\\nWith men, it's pretty typically a scenario where they are possessively jealous and looking to punish a partner for thinking about leaving them or having left them, Adams said. For women, it's sort of operating out of hopelessness and despondency."}

He needed a reliable and credible ally in Kabul.\\n\\nRight away, reports surfaced of electoral fraud on an epic scale — ghost voting, official miscounting, ballot-box stuffing, plus violence and intimidation at the polls.\\n\\nInitial results showed Karzai, the incumbent, had won. But his opponents, and many independent observers, accused his side of trying to steal the election. A U.N.-backed panel investigated and determined Karzai had received about 1 million illegal votes, a quarter of all those cast.\\n\\nWomen leave a Kabul polling station after voting in 2009. (Daniel Berehulak/Getty Images)\\n\\nThe outcome put Obama administration officials in a box. They had said corruption was intolerable but also had promised to respect Afghan sovereignty and not interfere with the election. Moreover, they did not want to completely alienate Karzai. If there was another vote, many saw him as the likely victor anyway.\\n\\nIn the end, the Obama administration brokered a deal in which Karzai was declared the winner after he agreed to share some power with his main rival. But in Lessons Learned interviews, several U.S. officials said the messy result ruined U.S. credibility.\\n\\nThat was profoundly destructive to a rule-of-law principle, Sarah Chayes | Lessons Learned interview | 5/26/2015Tap to view full document said Sarah Chayes, who served as a civilian adviser to the U.S. military at the time.

We took all of the data, Michael Flynn | Lessons Learned interview | 11/10/2015Tap to view full document Flynn, who was serving at the time as the U.S. military intelligence chief in Afghanistan, told government interviewers.

Months after the raid, investigators wiretapped a conversation in which a senior aide to Karzai allegedly agreed to block the New Ansari probe in exchange for a bribe.\\n\\nKarzai at the presidential palace in 2012. (Yuri Kozyrev/Noor)\\n\\nAfghan law enforcement agents arrested the aide, Mohammad Zia Salehi, in July 2010. Within hours, however, Karzai personally intervened and ordered Salehi's release from jail, declaring that investigators had overstepped their authority. The Afghan government later dropped all charges against Salehi.\\n\\nSome U.S. officials were furious and said it was time for a reckoning, while others argued it was more important to mollify Karzai and retain his support for the war. Complicating matters further was a New York Times report that Karzai's aide had been on the CIA's payroll for years.\\n\\nAgain the Obama administration backed down, and the U.S.-inspired anti-corruption drive lost even more steam.\\n\\nThe pivot point was the Salehi case, Lessons Learned interview | 4/12/2016Tap to view full document said an unnamed Justice Department official based in Kabul at the time. He told government interviewers that the arrest provoked a hornet reaction Lessons Learned interview | 4/12/2016Tap to view full document by the presidential palace, which ordered Afghan law enforcement agents to stop cooperating so closely with U.S. officials.\\n\\nThe interest and enthusiasm seemed to be lost after Salehi, Gert Berthold | Lessons Learned interview | 10/6/2015Tap to view full document added Gert Berthold, the forensic accountant who served in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2012.\\n\\nWHAT THEY SAID IN PRIVATE Dec. 11, 2015 Our money was empowering a lot of bad people. There was massive resentment among the Afghan people. And we were the most corrupt here, so had no credibility on the corruption issue. — Senior U.S. official, Lessons Learned interview\\n\\nLess than two months after Salehi's catch and release, an even bigger scandal arose to test the Obama administration's resolve.\\n\\nKabul Bank, the country's biggest, nearly collapsed under the weight of $1 billion in fraudulent loans — an amount equal to one-twelfth of the country's entire economic output the year before. The Afghan government engineered an emergency bailout to stem a run on the bank as angry crowds lined up to withdraw their savings.\\n\\nInvestigators soon determined Kabul Bank had falsified its books to hide hundreds of millions of dollars in unsecured loans to politically connected business executives, including the president's brother Mahmoud Karzai and the family of Fahim Khan, the warlord then serving as the country's first vice president.\\n\\nOn a scale of one to 10, it was a 20 here, Senior U.S. Treasury official posted to Kabul as an Afghan government adviser | Lessons Learned interview | 10/1/2015Tap to view full document an unnamed U.S. Treasury Department official posted to Kabul as an Afghan government adviser told interviewers.

You just can't. — Ryan Crocker, who twice served as the top U.S. diplomat in Kabul Listen\\n\\nU.S. officials had gone to great lengths to help the Afghan government create a viable financial sector, and now it was at risk of complete failure. Moreover, much of the looted money had originated from the U.S. treasury, which subsidized the salaries of Afghan soldiers, police and civil servants who made up the bulk of Kabul Bank's depositors.\\n\\nAt first, in public and in private, the Obama administration leaned on Karzai to fully investigate the Kabul Bank scandal — not only to recover the stolen money but also to demonstrate to the Afghan people that no one was above the law. The episode was seen as a pivotal moment, not just in the anti-corruption campaign but in the war itself, according to the Lessons Learned interviews.\\n\\nThere were a million things we were trying to do, and all of it depended on the Karzai regime as an effective partner, Senior U.S. official | Lessons Learned interview | 12/11/2015Tap to view full document an unnamed senior U.S. official told government interviewers.

I asked him, do you think this is a financially sound bank? He said, 'Yes.' And literally 30 days afterward, the whole house of cards came down. This was one of the biggest misses in my career.

But none of the intelligence agencies alerted law enforcement, because it wasn't in their mandate, Senior U.S. official | Lessons Learned interview | 3/1/2016Tap to view full document he added.\\n\\nFor about a year after the scandal became public, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, led by then-Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, made the case a top priority and pressed Karzai to take action, three former officials told government interviewers. But they said the embassy backed off after Eikenberry was replaced by Ryan Crocker in July 2011.\\n\\nIt was a case study of how fragile and precarious U.S. policy can be. Literally overnight our entire policy changed, U.S. Treasury official | Lessons Learned interview | 7/27/2015Tap to view full document the second Treasury Department official said.

{"original": "But everything changed after Geary connected with InReturn Strategies, a start-up intent on making hiring more inclusive by bridging the gaps between employers and job candidates with disabilities. Its founder, Jim Atwater, helped Geary prepare for interviews, showing him how his perspective and experiences could be an asset to potential employers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow, Geary works at Cerner, a global health-care technology company, where his decades of experience navigating the medical system inform his work as a data analyst. He said he's happier than he has ever been.\\n\\nFor me, it means that I can start building the life that I want, Geary said, rather than having to go along with what other people had planned for me.\\n\\nAbout 61 million Americans have some kind of disability, which the Americans With Disabilities Act defines as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. But even as inclusion becomes a marketing buzzword and major brands such as Nike roll out disability-friendly products, unemployment among groups with disabilities is more than double that of the general population. Less than 20 percent of people with disabilities held a job in 2019, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has been like this for decades.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAtwater said he created InReturn Strategies to tackle what's known as the disability employment gap. As one of roughly 400 deaf entrepreneurs in the United States, he knows how workers with disabilities can be overlooked and undervalued by employers. He says members of this demographic are often the last to be hired and the first to be let go, and they are often relegated to jobs below their skill level.\\n\\nThere's lots of people talking about inclusion and making tons of money from consulting, but very few people are doing anything about it, Atwater said. We are the mechanism to turn intent into action.\\n\\nResearch shows that hiring disabled workers benefits firms' bottom lines. A 2018 report from Accenture, which analyzed the disability protocols and financial performance of 140 companies, found that firms with the best practices saw 28 percent higher revenue, double the net income and 30 percent higher profit margins, on average, over a four-year period.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the number of people with disabilities in the labor force grew just 1 percent, the nation's gross domestic product could expand by as much as $25 billion, the Accenture report found.\\n\\nCompanies looking to hire workers with disabilities usually follow traditional hiring channels, which often include processes that can be exclusionary. Meanwhile, access providers — organizations offering services to people with disabilities — don't tend to have many connections in the private sector.\\n\\nWe're building bridges where there aren't any, said Scott Brouillette, InReturn's chief executive. How are you going to hire someone you don't understand and have no relationships with?\\n\\nNathan Beck, who has spent 20 years helping people with disabilities access jobs in Hamilton County, Ohio, said it can be hard to get companies to care.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLots of times, people with disabilities don't want to disclose that they're disabled, because they're scared they won't be interviewed, Beck said. The way Jim and InReturn are approaching businesses is about trying to integrate people with disabilities into the business strategy, as opposed to the opposite. It's a whole new approach.\\n\\nInReturn's platform connects private-sector companies with more than 4,500 access providers across the country. InReturn then helps companies tailor their practices to better work with candidates with disabilities.\\n\\nAs director of human resources at Lead Bank, a Kansas City, Kan., bank, Angela Blackburn has striven to a build a workforce that reflects the community. But like many hiring managers, she has struggled with how to wade into a different talent pool.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI feel like when people feel like they're not knowledgeable in that area, they shy away from it, Blackburn said. Not because they aren't interested in including the population, but because they don't know what to do. And that's where InReturn comes into play.\\n\\nWorking-age people with disabilities in the United States have nearly $500 billion a year in disposable income, according to a 2018 report from the American Institutes for Research, making the group one of the largest market segments in the country. But, on average, they make 63 cents on the dollar compared with their non-disabled counterparts.\\n\\nMatteo Lieb, who works on employment policy and programs at the National Down Syndrome Society, said employers often treat hiring people with disabilities as an act of philanthropy. It should be about snagging the best talent, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe really work with employers to have them realize that this is not just something they're doing out of the kindness of their hearts, he said. This is something good they're doing for themselves.\\n\\nIn a testimonial, the parents of a young man with autism described his difficulties landing a job before InReturn. Although he holds a master's degree in business administration and passed his certified public accountant exam on the first try, the interview process presented major hurdles.\\n\\nThose with high functioning autism lack pragmatic language skills, skills we use in daily interaction with others, the family wrote in the testimonial. Employers need to be aware of these challenges and find a way to bridge the gap.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInReturn helped communicate those challenges to potential employers, giving them the context they needed to make their screening processes more inclusive. Within two weeks, the man was hired as a tax associate at a wealth management firm.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOur son was at ease, gained confidence and gained success, the testimonial reads. It is our hopes that all companies will get on board and make inclusiveness a priority. There is great talent just waiting to be tapped into.\\n\\nSome companies are beginning to understand the untapped value of workers with disabilities. Microsoft has a dedicated website for job-seekers with disabilities to learn about the company's hiring practices and accommodations. Procter & Gamble, Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Ford and other giants have neurodiversity hiring initiatives to seek employees with neurological differences, such as autism, dyslexia and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the challenge goes beyond changing the way companies see workers with disabilities; it's also about helping these workers access all the opportunities available to them, said Chris Lee, who is working with InReturn to set up a pilot program with the Kansas State School for the Blind.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor a lot of people with disabilities, their self-awareness of what their future can look like is very low, Lee said. A lot of it is about introducing them to businesses or career paths they never knew existed.\\n\\nIn a case study, InReturn brought a group of young people with Down syndrome to an Apple store in Kansas City, Kan. When the store manager asked about their job aspirations, they uniformly said they imagined working in a grocery store or restaurant.\\n\\nThat's all they've ever seen someone like them do, Atwater said. The visibility to what their opportunities can be is just nonexistent.\\n\\nIn the fall, InReturn was appointed to the CEO Commission for Disability Employment, a group of companies and other organizations working to help people with disabilities achieve and maintain equal access to meaningful employment. Its message of dignified, profitable inclusion is one it hopes can be shared with all companies, regardless of size or field."}

It warned that such pernicious actions could both threaten their February pact and jeopardize progress in resolving issues among Afghans, turning nascent hopes to despair.\\n\\nAmerican military officials here responded with unusual speed and sharpness, saying Monday that U.S. stated policy is to defend Afghan forces against Taliban attacks. For the first time, they also directly blamed the insurgents for a recent spate of targeted killings of journalists, civic leaders and government officials.\\n\\nTaliban spokesmen have denied similar charges by Afghan officials and suggested that they amount to a survival tactic by the government of President Ashraf Ghani, who narrowly won reelection last year but has lost public support as violence and economic problems persist.\\n\\nThe Taliban's accusations [that] the US violated the US-TB agreement are false, tweeted Col. Sonny Leggett, the U.S. military spokesman here. The Taliban's campaign of unclaimed attacks & targeted killings of government officials, civil society leaders & journalists must also cease for peace to succeed.\\n\\nThe status of the U.S.-Taliban pact, while seemingly unrelated to the domestic issues of religion, power-sharing and democratic freedoms that Afghan and Taliban leaders are slated to negotiate, is a critical but highly contested factor in the Afghan talks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder that deal, the Trump administration agreed to gradually withdraw most U.S. troops by early this year, acceding to the insurgents' most important demand. There are now about 5,000 troops in the country, and that number is slated to drop to 2,500 by next month. In return, Taliban negotiators agreed to reduce violence, avoid targeting American forces and cut ties with al-Qaeda and other extremists.\\n\\nMany Afghans say the Taliban has failed to fulfill those pledges and that the U.S. concessions gave the religious militia too much leverage over a weak Afghan government at the current talks. The insurgents, meanwhile, are worried that the incoming Biden administration will set further conditions before continuing the promised troop drawdown.\\n\\nAt the moment, though, the message from Washington, amid a tense and contested presidential transition, is muddled. On Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo praised the Taliban for not killing any Americans since the pact was signed, suggesting that it will hold. The next day, the U.S. military denounced the rash of civilian killings as an obstacle to peace.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKhalilzad, who is meeting with Pakistani, Afghan and Taliban leaders during his current regional visit in an effort to improve the chances for revived talks, called the targeted killings unacceptable but did not directly accuse the Taliban.\\n\\nHe also hinted at problems on the Afghan side, including disputes between Ghani and some negotiators, who insist that an interim government must be installed because the Taliban refuses to recognize his administration and will never make peace with it.\\n\\nOther divisions exist over how hard to press the Taliban for a nationwide cease-fire, which it has resisted. In a statement Tuesday welcoming the resumption of talks, the U.N. special representative for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, said a cessation in fighting would create a better atmosphere for talks and allow emergency winter aid to reach rural areas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Monday, Interior Minister Massoud Andarabi told a group of lawmakers that the Taliban is preparing to launch a full-scale war in the coming months, ordering fighters to keep going through the bitterly cold winter instead of waiting for their traditional spring offensive.\\n\\nTaliban officials declared Monday that they are now in a relatively stronger political and military position than at any previous time.

It devised tactics to push back against the agency. And it commissioned a Crisis Playbook to burnish its image and blame the federal government for not doing enough to stop the epidemic.\\n\\nThe new information is emerging through the efforts of lawyers in the massive federal lawsuit against two dozen drug companies in Cleveland who have obtained depositions from high-ranking company officials, internal company emails and confidential memos. The documents were unsealed in July after a year-long legal fight by The Washington Post and the owner of the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia.\\n\\nIn 2016, the drug companies convinced members of Congress and Obama administration officials to rein in the DEA and force the agency to treat them as partners in efforts to solve the crisis.

The plaintiffs' lawyers are pursuing their civil case under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, a law crafted to attack criminal organizations.\\n\\nDefendants carried out their coordinated strategy to weaken the DEA's enforcement capabilities in part through the Marino Bill, states a filing by the plaintiffs' lawyers in the case.\\n\\nLawyers for the drug companies have ridiculed the RICO argument and asked U.S. District Judge Dan Polster to toss out the case before it heads to trial, scheduled for Oct. 21.\\n\\nPlaintiffs have no evidence that Distributors associated with Manufacturers or one another, as part of a continuing unit, for the 'common purpose of engaging in a course of unlawful conduct,'  drug company lawyers wrote in their motion to dismiss, which was denied by Polster on Sept. 10.\\n\\nIn a statement to The Post, the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, the association that represents drug distributors, defended its support of the Marino bill, formally known as the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act.\\n\\nThe intent of the law was not to decrease the DEA's enforcement against distributors, the alliance said in a statement. HDA believed that the legislation would help provide greater clarity to one element of DEA's enforcement standards and encourage communication and coordination that was much-needed between the DEA and the industry.\\n\\n[Full responses from distributors and a drug industry trade association]\\n\\nThe alliance also noted that the bill was approved by both houses of Congress and signed by Obama.\\n\\nBeginning in 2006, the DEA went after drug distributors and pharmacies for failing to report suspicious orders of millions of opioid pills that spilled into the black market. Over the next decade, the DEA brought two dozen enforcement cases and forced the companies to pay $500 million in fines.\\n\\nExecutives of the nation's largest drug manufacturers and distributors were alarmed.\\n\\nThe DEA is now hammering all of us, Ann Berkey, then a senior vice president of McKesson Corp., wrote in a 2014 email to another senior McKesson officer, according to a deposition in the Cleveland case.\\n\\nDuring meetings at resorts in places like Pebble Beach, Calif., and Palm Beach, Fla., the industry alliance charted a way to respond. They implemented a political strategy that they knew the DEA believed would result in tying the agencies [sic] hands to actively and aggressively address diversion and compliance, according to an internal alliance memo that is now part of the case.\\n\\nThe strategy worked.\\n\\nFor years, Joe Rannazzisi led the government's war against opioid abuse at the DEA. He says he was pushed out by members of Congress amid a drug industry campaign to weaken enforcement. (Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe Big Three\\n\\nBy 2005, the opioid crisis was claiming 10,000 lives a year.\\n\\nThe DEA mounted a crusade against Internet pharmacies and corrupt doctors and then took on the companies making and distributing the opioids to prevent drugs from being diverted to the black market.\\n\\nThe effort was led by Joe Rannazzisi, a hard-charging DEA agent from New York who worked the streets of Detroit before being promoted to lead the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, a small unit that was seen at the time as something of a backwater in an agency devoted to pursuing high-profile heroin, cocaine and marijuana cases.\\n\\n[Who is Joe Rannazzisi: The DEA man who fought drug companies and lost]\\n\\nThe DEA had always relied on drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies to police themselves by monitoring suspicious orders and reporting them to the agency. It was essentially an honor system. The flow of pharmaceuticals was simply too immense for the DEA to monitor on its own.\\n\\nRannazzisi and his DEA legal counsel, D. Linden Barber, wrote to drug distributors and manufacturers, warning them to more closely track their painkillers and stop suspiciously large shipments to pharmacies.\\n\\nThe warnings didn't work. The DEA decided to get tougher. It had several tools at its disposal, in ascending order of severity: It could send a company a letter of admonition warning it to follow the law; it could send an order to show cause demanding to know why operations should not be shut down for failing to report suspicious orders; it could issue an immediate suspension order instantly halting operations; or it could bring a civil or criminal enforcement case with heavy fines.\\n\\nBut cases against big companies were difficult to make, requiring on-the-ground investigations involving numerous interviews and thousands of pages of documents. They could take years to complete.\\n\\nIn August 2006, the DEA issued a show-cause order asking McKesson, the nation's largest drug distributor, why its operations at the company's distribution center in Lakeland, Fla., should not be shut down. The DEA alleged that three McKesson distribution centers filled hundreds of suspicious orders of hydrocodone, such as Vicodin, placed by Internet pharmacies.\\n\\nSoon, there would be even harsher action.\\n\\nIn April 2007, the DEA issued an immediate-suspension order for the Lakeland, Fla., distribution center of AmerisourceBergen, the third-largest drug distributor in the nation. Drug distributors based their hubs in Lakeland because it is centrally located near major highways.\\n\\nMcKesson and AmerisourceBergen were two of the Big Three — along with Cardinal Health — which distributed nearly 85 percent of the nation's legal drugs. They all belonged to the Healthcare Distribution Alliance — then called the Healthcare Distribution Management Association, or HDMA — which represented nearly three dozen drug distributors.\\n\\nThe Big Three made up the alliance's executive committee.\\n\\nAn excerpt from an industry alliance executive's email to members.\\n\\nOn Sept. 25, 2007, Anita T. Ducca, then the alliance's senior director for regulatory affairs and health-care policy, drafted an email to members.\\n\\nGiven the intensity and impact of the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) recent actions, and the concerns expressed by HDMA's Executive Committee last week, HDMA recommends developing a comprehensive DEA strategy, she wrote, according to a deposition unsealed in the Cleveland case. What, if any, legal options do we have?\\n\\nShe wrote that the strategy included contacting appropriate decision-makers at the DEA, on Capitol Hill and inside federal agencies who may be supportive of the industry.\\n\\nA second order to show cause went to a McKesson facility in Landover, Md., in November 2007. That month, Cardinal had its license suspended at its center in Auburn, Wash. The DEA alleged the company had supplied 18 million doses of hydrocodone in nine months to retail pharmacies, including one filling illegitimate prescriptions.\\n\\nThey just weren't getting it, said Jim Geldhof, a 43-year DEA veteran supervisor now hired as an expert by the plaintiffs' attorneys. They weren't paying attention to us.\\n\\nAn email from Jack Crowley of Purdue Pharma to a counterpart at Cardinal Health.\\n\\nIn December 2007, Jack Crowley, a former DEA supervisor who had joined OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma as executive director of compliance, wrote an email to a counterpart at Cardinal.\\n\\nI'm sorry that DEA is being so aggressive with this Suspicious Orders stuff, Crowley said. I wish there was something I could do to help in this situation — we are all in the same boat.\\n\\nTactic 8\\n\\nIn the face of the DEA pressure, the industry alliance took a two-pronged approach.\\n\\nPublicly, it issued industry guidelines that appeared to appease the agency and provide greater controls against drug diversion.\\n\\nIn February 2008, the alliance said it planned to adopt best practice guidelines for its companies to follow, the unsealed documents from the Cleveland lawsuit show. The guidelines included establishing limits of pills or thresholds that customers such as pharmacies could order. The guidelines also included identifying orders of unusual size, frequency and pattern and stopping shipments that seemed suspicious, all of which are required by law and regulations.\\n\\nThe DEA would later call the guidelines important for guarding against diversion of pain pills.\\n\\nBut privately, the alliance was pursuing another path. An internal alliance document says one of the proposed reasons for the guidelines was to head-off further enforcement or regulatory action by the DEA.\\n\\nOn March 20, 2008, Kristen Freitas, then associate director of federal government affairs for the alliance, wrote an email that outlined a confidential draft political strategy. It contained several tactics to combat the aggressiveness of the DEA.\\n\\nAs part of the strategy, the alliance would brief congressional appropriations committee members in advance of DEA budget hearings. The strategy said to seek commitment to ask questions of the agency's then-administrator, Michele Leonhart, who was scheduled to testify.\\n\\nThe alliance also wrote questions for the lawmakers to ask Leonhart.\\n\\nSo you drafted on behalf of your members potential questions to be asked by members of Congress to ask the DEA, correct? plaintiff's attorney Mark Pifko asked Patrick M. Kelly, the alliance's executive vice president of government affairs, during a deposition in the Cleveland case.\\n\\nThat's what I understand, Kelly said.\\n\\nPifko then showed Kelly two talking points the organization had prepared for members of Congress to pose during the hearing. One of them was a defense of the drug industry: It seems to me at the end of the day that prescription drug abuse is caused by inappropriate prescribing and inappropriate dispensing, neither of which wholesalers are authorized or capable of regulating or enforcing.\\n\\nSo these questions are for senators to ask the DEA? Pifko asked.\\n\\nThat's the process, Kelly said.\\n\\nAnother tactic: Seek advocates among pain community who will assist in delivering our message to Hill, according to the unsealed records.\\n\\nTactic 8 in the draft was one of the most important elements of the alliance's political strategy: Identify high-level congressional 'champion' who will request a meeting with DEA to discuss concerns.\\n\\nPifko asked Kelly during the deposition why the organization needed a high-level congressional champion?\\n\\nWe were seeking greater clarity from the agency and it was not forthcoming, Kelly said. We were requesting that our congressional colleagues possibly request a meeting so we could convey those concerns.\\n\\nOne of the high-level champions would turn out to be Tom Marino of Pennsylvania. And one of the things he would do was to request an investigation of Rannazzisi, head of the DEA's Office of Diversion Control, by the inspector general of the Justice Department.\\n\\nFormer congressman Tom Marino (R-Pa.), center, sponsored a bill that, according to a former senior Justice Department official, created a high standard for DEA action against drug distributors. It would become law in 2016. (Susan Walsh/AP)\\n\\n'Overzealous regulators'\\n\\nIn 2008, the DEA took its strongest action yet against the drug companies. That May, McKesson agreed to pay a $13 million fine — then a record for a drug diversion case — for failing to report suspicious orders from the Internet pharmacies and drugstores. That record was shattered in October when Cardinal agreed to pay $34 million.\\n\\nThat same month, Congress passed a bill shutting down Internet pharmacies. Signed by President George W. Bush, it was a major victory for the DEA.\\n\\nIn its database tracking drug shipments, the DEA could see the flow of opioids from some of the nation's largest manufacturers and distributors to an increasing number of pain management clinics, some of which became fronts for illegal pill mills. The DEA took its offensive to the next level.\\n\\nThe agency again notified distributors and manufacturers that their pills were being diverted to the streets, and they had a responsibility under the law to monitor and report suspicious activity.\\n\\nThe first time, you can say you didn't know, said Rannazzisi, now an expert witness for plaintiffs suing the drug companies. The second time, you can't say we didn't know. They knew. They knew what they were doing. How did they know? We told them. Everything we told them to do, they disregarded.\\n\\nThe companies were feeling the pressure. Crowley, Purdue's compliance director, wrote to a colleague on March 19, 2008, about DEA's latest plans to squeeze the wholesalers and distributors on 'pain clinics,'  according to an email unsealed in the case. Crowley predicted that the DEA will call distributors into Headquarters and read them the riot act, etc.\\n\\nThree months later, Crowley wrote to a senior vice president at Cardinal and another Purdue director to say the drug industry needed to support itself and each other and to protect itself from overzealous regulators.\\n\\nI'd like to discuss that with you to see if we can support each other in the 'DEA-Created' mess, Crowley said. I can certainly commiserate with you about DEA actions from a select few individual crusaders in their Headquarters.\\n\\nCrowley, who has since left Purdue, told The Post in an email that he and his colleagues did their best to cooperate with the DEA.\\n\\nAll of these emails have context and can't be read fairly in isolation but none in any way changes our record of cooperation and our proactive steps to address the misconduct of bad actors, Crowley wrote.\\n\\nBetween 2008 and 2011, the DEA had launched a half-dozen pain-clinic investigations involving drug distributors, including Cardinal for a second time, and one manufacturer, Mallinckrodt, the largest producer of generic opioids. The DEA hit them with inspection warrants, subpoenaed internal corporate records and issued orders to show cause as well as immediate suspension orders.\\n\\nIn April 2012, the alliance was concerned about the DEA's latest efforts to thwart drug diversion and abuse, according to an internal email unsealed in the Cleveland case.\\n\\nThe alliance had enlisted one of Washington's most prominent attorneys, Robert B. Barnett. He and his law partner, Richard M. Cooper, had some advice for the alliance.\\n\\nInstead of challenging the DEA, the attorneys suggested the industry may be better off averting DEA actions by taking even stronger compliance measures, according to an internal alliance memo.\\n\\nAlliance representatives also told Barnett and Cooper that they were considering a legislative approach to address the growing tension with the DEA.\\n\\nMr. Barnett and Mr. Cooper felt that new legislation to specifically address our concerns with DEA was highly unlikely to be successful due to limited momentum in that direction, alliance President John M. Gray wrote in the memo.\\n\\nBarnett and Cooper declined to comment. (Their firm, Williams & Connolly, does legal work for The Post.)\\n\\nDespite the pessimistic assessment, the industry moved forward with the legislative plan.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2012, the DEA embarked on its biggest diversion action to date, filing a civil case against Walgreens. The agency accused one of the nation's largest pharmacy chains of flooding Florida with painkillers. The case would ultimately result in an $80 million fine.\\n\\nThe details were damning.\\n\\nBetween April 2010 and February 2012, Walgreens's distribution center in Jupiter, Fla., sent 13.7 million oxycodone doses to six pharmacies in the state, a large and sudden increase.\\n\\nThis occurred despite internal warnings. Kristine Atwell, who managed the Jupiter center, said of one pharmacy, I don't know how they can even house this many bottle[s] to be honest. How do we go about checking the validity of these orders? according to an email now part of the Cleveland case.\\n\\nA DEA investigation of the Jupiter facility found that Walgreens failed to maintain an effective system for detecting suspicious orders.\\n\\nThe DEA cited the industry alliance's own compliance guidelines issued four years earlier as evidence that Walgreens knew or should have known that it was required to report suspicious orders and ignored them.\\n\\nThe alliance eventually removed the guidelines from its website, noting that they were never intended to be an industry standard, according to minutes from an alliance board meeting that were cited in a deposition in the case.\\n\\nIn February 2012, the DEA suspended the registration of Cardinal for the second time for failing to report suspicious orders of painkillers.\\n\\nThe battle between the DEA and the companies was approaching its final, critical stage.\\n\\nLinden Barber, who left the DEA and set up a law practice to represent the industry he once regulated, had warned that the agency's legal office could lose cases on appeal. The office eventually raised the agency's internal standard of proof for bringing enforcement actions from a preponderance of evidence to beyond a reasonable doubt, according to former DEA supervisors and lawyers. The number of cases brought by Rannazzisi's team plummeted.\\n\\nFormer high-level Justice officials who worked for or on behalf of Cardinal approached their former colleagues. Rannazzisi was summoned to the Justice Department by then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, who later told The Post he thought it made sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say.\\n\\nAn excerpt from the industry's Crisis Playbook, developed by a crisis communications firm.\\n\\nIn the wake of the Walgreens and Cardinal cases, the industry alliance hired a crisis communications company, APCO Worldwide. In April 2013, the D.C.-based firm created a 44-page Crisis Playbook that proposed responses for the industry in several theoretical scenarios.\\n\\nUnder one, the DEA has suspended the license of a drug company that was filling unusually large orders from several pharmacies. The playbook suggested that drug companies consider using the suspension as an opportunity to push its message of misdirected DEA enforcement with national media and to inform relevant members of Congress about the action to head off greater criticism.\\n\\nA talking point to use with the news media: DEA appears to be pursuing a path of conflict, rather than collaboration with our industry.\\n\\n(Illustration by Eddie Alvarez/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe Marino bill\\n\\nBy 2013, Tom Marino, a former U.S. attorney from Pennsylvania, was a second-term Republican congressman from Williamsport, a community that had been ravaged by the opioid epidemic. Representatives from the industry enlisted Marino and then-Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), whose state also was hard hit by opioids, to their cause.\\n\\nBoth lawmakers told industry lobbyists that they would be willing to work with the drug companies and had expressed interest in introducing legislation on their behalf, according to an email unsealed in the Cleveland case.\\n\\nRep. Marino's office is very open to feedback and additional ideas, Jewelyn Cosgrove, a lobbyist for the alliance, wrote to her colleagues on June 12, 2013.\\n\\nA lobbyist for the industry alliance emailed colleagues about working with the measure's sponsor.\\n\\nSix months later, drug company representatives gathered at the alliance's headquarters in Northern Virginia, for a DEA Strategy Task Force Meeting. The companies included McKesson, Cardinal and AmerisourceBergen, along with several other distributors, including H.D. Smith.\\n\\nThe representatives identified three areas of attack, according to an email written by H.D. Smith Senior Vice President Tom Twitty on Dec. 12, 2013, and recently unsealed in the case.\\n\\nTwitty told his bosses that the industry representatives had agreed to work together and discussed ways to prepare for blowback on the Marino/Blackburn bill, which was about to be introduced on Capitol Hill. They also decided to use material from APCO Worldwide, the company that created the Crisis Playbook, to conduct a targeted media outreach campaign. They agreed it was time to craft industry responses to push back against negative news stories.\\n\\nMy sense was that all were pretty passionate about going after this, except Cardinal, Twitty wrote in the email. More to come.\\n\\nTwitty declined to comment about the meeting. So did Cardinal. H.D. Smith has since been acquired by AmerisourceBergen.\\n\\nAn executive at distributor H.D. Smith wrote to his bosses after executives from several companies gathered for a meeting on DEA strategy.\\n\\nTwo months later, on Feb. 18, 2014, Marino and Blackburn introduced legislation on Capitol Hill that would redefine the law regulating suspicious orders filled by drug companies.\\n\\nThe initial version of the legislation was written by Barber, according to an internal Justice Department document. Barber, the onetime DEA legal counsel who had worked alongside Rannazzisi, was representing some of the biggest names in the drug business, including Cardinal. He gave the industry intimate knowledge of the DEA's strategy.\\n\\nBarber, now a senior vice president at Cardinal, did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe professional credentials and personal character of the Cardinal executives named in the reporting are unassailable and the company stands behind both their service to our country, and to Cardinal Health's commitment to work hard every day to be part of the solution, a Cardinal spokeswoman said in a statement to The Post.\\n\\nThe unsealed court records show Marino reached out to Cardinal, which was in the process of pushing for the legislation.\\n\\nOne of our member companies had been contacted by Mr. Marino, said Kelly, the top lobbyist for the alliance, which by then had changed its name to the Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA).\\n\\nDo you know which member company it was? Kelly was asked during his deposition.\\n\\nIt was Cardinal.\\n\\nThen they reached out to you and asked HDA to participate?\\n\\nThey did.\\n\\nDid HDA end up providing any drafting on the bill?\\n\\nWe did participate in that process, Kelly said.\\n\\nThe bill would create a high standard for the DEA to meet in order to immediately suspend a drug company's operations, former DEA officials told The Post. Previously, the DEA had to show only that a company's actions were posing an imminent danger to public health or safety. The new bill defined imminent danger to mean that a company was creating a significant and present risk of death or serious bodily harm.\\n\\nFormer DEA agents and agency lawyers have told The Post it would be virtually impossible to show that a drug company thousands of miles from a particular community was posing a present risk.\\n\\nIn the spring of 2014, the alliance finalized preparations for an upcoming congressional hearing on the Marino bill. Scheduled to testify: Rannazzisi, Barber and John Gray, the president of the alliance.\\n\\nOn April 3, a Washington lobbying firm provided the alliance with questions for members of Congress to ask during the hearing, a common practice on Capitol Hill but not widely known outside Washington.\\n\\nFreitas, the alliance official, was concerned that the questions could be traced back to the outside lobbying firm, co-founded by Carlyle P. Thorsen, according to emails unsealed in the Cleveland case.\\n\\nThis is all so sensitive and anxiety levels are high so we need to have some control over how these questions are shared, Freitas wrote to Thorsen that day.\\n\\nThorsen, who runs Thorsen French Advocacy, also preferred to remain behind the scenes.\\n\\nPls scrub my name and source info before they are forwarded, he replied.\\n\\nThe alliance would go on to pay his firm $140,000 in lobbying fees that year, records show.\\n\\nThorsen declined to comment.\\n\\nThe suggested questions for lawmakers to ask included:\\n\\nWhat efforts is DEA engaged in to promulgate clear standards for prescribers, pharmacies, and distributors?\\n\\nWhat are you doing [to] help well-intentioned registrants determine who they can do business with?\\n\\nOn April 7, a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee held its hearing.\\n\\nAmong the questions that Blackburn asked Rannazzisi:\\n\\nArticulate what the efforts are that the DEA is engaged in to promulgate some clear standards for the prescribers, for the pharmacies, for the distributors?\\n\\nWhat are you doing to help well-intentioned registrants to determine who they can do business with?\\n\\n(Illustration by Eddie Alvarez/The Washington Post)\\n\\n'I applaud your efforts'\\n\\nAn internal email written in 2014 by Ann Berkey, the then-McKesson senior vice president for public affairs, shows how the company's lobbyists were also working with Rep. Michael C. Burgess (R-Tex.), then vice chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee.\\n\\nPer our discussion with Rep. Burgess on Saturday, his office called me this afternoon before the hearing and asked me for questions he could ask DEA, Berkey wrote in the email disclosed in an unsealed deposition.\\n\\nBerkey, who has retired from McKesson, declined to comment.\\n\\nBurgess also declined to comment.\\n\\nThe DEA and the Justice Department opposed the measure.\\n\\nGray, the president of the alliance, wrote a memo saying he had conversations with numerous members of his group, along with select Hill staff. Members of the alliance noted that the DEA believed the bill would be tying the agencies [sic] hands, according to the memo disclosed in an unsealed deposition.\\n\\nWithin a few months, the first bill died in a House committee.\\n\\nSoon after, Marino and Blackburn introduced a second version, along with 11 co-sponsors.\\n\\nThis version also would have made proving cases more difficult for the DEA, according to former federal officials. It defined imminent danger as a case in which a company intentionally distributed or dispensed drugs in a manner that poses a present or foreseeable risk of serious adverse health consequences or death.\\n\\nThe bill also would require that drug companies be given an opportunity to file corrective action plans, which would delay any enforcement actions by the DEA.\\n\\nIn July 2014, after the House passed the bill, then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. publicly came out against it.\\n\\nHe said it would severely undermine a critical component of our efforts to prevent communities and families from falling prey to dangerous drugs. Leonhart, then the DEA administrator, vehemently opposed the bill, according to Rannazzisi and other DEA officials.\\n\\nThe bill died in the Senate.\\n\\nIn September 2014, Marino and Blackburn accused Rannazzisi of trying to intimidate the United States Congress during a July 2 conference call with congressional staffers. They said Rannazzisi told them you'll be protecting criminals with the bill.\\n\\nThe two lawmakers asked the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate Rannazzisi, who denied their accusation. The investigation came to nothing, but Rannazzisi said it derailed his career.\\n\\nIn January 2015, Marino and Blackburn introduced a third version of the bill in the House. The next month, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the powerful chairman of the Finance Committee, introduced it in the Senate. The bill was called S.483.\\n\\nOn Sept. 28, 2015, Gray issued a directive to the members of the alliance during a board of directors meeting, according to the unsealed court records. Item Number 1 on the agenda: Exhaust all efforts to secure passage of S. 483.\\n\\nThis bill also created a high bar for action, according to a former senior Justice official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The measure defined imminent danger as a substantial likelihood of an immediate threat that death, serious bodily harm, or abuse of a controlled substance will occur.\\n\\nDEA officials still did not want the bill but felt there was too much momentum for it in Congress, the Justice official said. DEA officials said the bill, which removed the word intentionally and replaced present with immediate, was a less bad option, the Justice official said.\\n\\nFor those reasons, the DEA did not raise a red flag with Justice, the official said. The Post has previously reported that a White House official, speaking anonymously, said that neither the DEA nor the Justice Department raised objections to the bill.\\n\\nOn March 17, the Senate passed the measure by unanimous consent. The House followed weeks later. Not one lawmaker opposed it.\\n\\nAn email from a Purdue Pharma executive to colleagues that described the company's role in the bill's development.\\n\\nThe bill is one we have been working on with HDMA and [the National Association of Chain Drug Stores] for the past two years, Burt Rosen, Purdue Pharma's vice president for government affairs, wrote that evening in an email to his colleagues that was unsealed in the Cleveland case. Purdue was very active in influencing the ultimate definition of an 'imminent danger to the public health or safety.' \\n\\nRosen declined an interview request. Josephine Martin, a spokeswoman for Purdue Pharma, declined to discuss Rosen's email and said no one from the company would comment because of the pending litigation in Cleveland.\\n\\nThe change in position at Justice and DEA came after a change in leadership at the two agencies.\\n\\nAttorney General Loretta E.

Lynch, has never publicly explained why the Justice Department switched its position.\\n\\nLeonhart's successor, Chuck Rosenberg, has never explained why he did not oppose the bill.\\n\\nObama signed it into law on April 19, 2016. He has never spoken publicly about the bill.\\n\\nLynch, Rosenberg and Obama all declined repeated interview requests from The Post. Marino did not return requests for an interview.\\n\\nBlackburn, now a U.S. senator, declined an interview request but provided a statement to The Post saying she has worked to fight the opioid crisis.\\n\\nThe Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Law Enforcement Act was passed unanimously by every Democrat and Republican in the United States House and Senate and signed into law by President Obama, she said. As a mom and a grandmom, my heart breaks for those touched by the opioid crisis.\\n\\nSince the first Marino bill was introduced, the sponsors and co-sponsors have received $1.4 million in campaign contributions from the industry and the alliance, according to campaign finance records.\\n\\nTwo months after Obama signed the bill, Rosenberg testified on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nHatch praised the DEA's new chief.\\n\\nI've been told the DEA's relationship with supply chain stakeholders has improved since you've taken the helm at DEA, Hatch said. I want to just say I applaud your efforts on this front.\\n\\nHatch asked Rosenberg how he saw the partnership between the DEA and the industry evolving.\\n\\nThe overwhelming majority, 99 plus percent, are our allies in this thing, Rosenberg testified. What we need is them as partners.\\n\\nMore than a year later, in October 2017, The Post and 60 Minutes published and broadcast a joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the passage of the Marino bill. Several DEA officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they had fought the bill for years but eventually yielded to industry pressure that had created a wave of support for it in Congress.\\n\\nIn addition, the news organizations cited a law review article by the DEA's chief administrative law judge, John J. Mulrooney II, who wrote that the Marino bill imposed a dramatic diminution of the agency's authority.\\n\\nThe reporting had an immediate impact. Marino, who had been nominated by President Trump to become the nation's drug czar, withdrew from consideration two days after stories appeared.\\n\\nThey made it and camouflaged it so well all of us were fooled, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said. All of us. Nobody knew. That bill has to be retracted, has to be repealed.\\n\\nA spokesperson for Blackburn, one of the authors of the bill, said at the time if there are any unintended consequences from this bipartisan legislation . . . they should be addressed immediately.\\n\\nThen-Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was dubious about the law when he was a senator and had concluded that it should be changed. Forty-four state attorneys general, as well as congressional Democrats, also called for repeal. Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said the new law handcuffs the DEA.\\n\\nHatch publicly attacked the reporting by The Post and 60 Minutes in 2017.\\n\\nThis wasn't some effort to help drug companies kill people, he said. This was an effort to ensure that DEA's efforts . . . didn't end up hurting legitimate patients.\\n\\nThe industry alliance told The Post recently that the law did not weaken the DEA's ability to issue immediate suspension orders against drug companies and cited 2017 testimony from Demetra Ashley, then acting chief of the agency's Diversion Control division.\\n\\nAshley testified that the law did not hamstring the DEA. But she also said she was concerned about the agency's ability to use immediate suspension orders against drug distributors and manufacturers.\\n\\nDEA along with the Department of Justice supports a change in the legislation, she testified.\\n\\nSince the bill became law, the DEA has issued no immediate suspension orders against manufacturers and one against a distributor in May 2018. The Louisiana distributor, Morris & Dickson, denied the allegations, saying the DEA failed to show any evidence of an immediate threat of death, serious bodily harm or abuse — the new standard in the Marino bill that became law. Two weeks later, the Justice Department rescinded the order.\\n\\nIn February and March 2018, U.S. Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd wrote letters to Congress requesting that the legislation be rewritten.\\n\\nAfter four months of repeated requests, DOJ finally offered specific feedback to this committee's questions, stating they believe the law does impede the DEA's ability to do its job, said Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), then chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\\n\\nWalden said in a statement Thursday that he is still waiting for guidance on how to rewrite the law from the DEA.\\n\\nThe Justice Department, which oversees the DEA, declined to comment. The DEA also declined to comment.\\n\\nDrug distributors defended their role in the law in recent statements to The Post.\\n\\nOur nation's drug supply chain is highly complex, so we routinely engage with elected officials and regulators to share our knowledge, experience and occasionally, recommendations, McKesson said. There is nothing inappropriate about companies communicating with policymakers in a transparent, law-abiding way to foster a more effective working relationship with the government.\\n\\nA Cardinal spokeswoman said the company supported the legislation, which was passed unanimously in both chambers of Congress and signed into law by President Obama, because it brought greater clarity to the regulatory landscape.\\n\\nAmerisourceBergen said the new law sought to clarify the industry's responsibilities for opioids.\\n\\nWe worked in conjunction with DEA and other members of industry to support its passage while keeping the DEA fully empowered, a company spokesman said. To the extent it can be proven there were any unintended consequences of the legislation, including lessened enforcement authority by DEA, we support parts of the law being reevaluated.\\n\\nThe Marino bill remains the law today.\\n\\nscott.higham@washpost.com\\n\\nsari.horwitz@washpost.com\\n\\nsteven.rich@washpost.com\\n\\nmeryl.kornfield@washpost.com"}

Nuland, a retired career Foreign Service officer, served as the State Department's top Europe and Russia official from 2013 until Trump's inauguration. Finer, a former journalist, held various Obama administration national security posts, including working for Biden in the vice president's office and later as Secretary of State John F. Kerry's chief of staff.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese latest appointments reinforce the established pattern: resurrecting the Obama foreign policy team, albeit in different positions. Secretary of state nominee Antony Blinken moved up from deputy secretary of state. The designated national security adviser to President-elect Biden, Jake Sullivan, moved up from the role of national security adviser to Vice President Biden. Kerry is back on the National Security Council Principals Committee (which he served on when as Secretary of State), this time as a special envoy for climate change. Susan E. Rice is back in the West Wing as head of the Domestic Policy Council. Biden's Defense Department appointments fit this pattern, as well.\\n\\nTo be sure, after four years of bureaucratic mayhem and mismanagement under President Trump, there is comfort knowing that national security will be run by people who are competent and experienced. Yet, even though competence is a prerequisite to good policymaking, it's not enough by itself. The concern around Washington is that the same people who crafted and defended President Barack Obama's foreign policy won't be willing or able to recognize, much less rectify, its shortcomings.\\n\\nThese concerns were heightened when Kerry gave his first major post-election foreign policy interview last month to NPR. He argued that the United States needed to put climate change cooperation at the forefront of U.S.-China relations. Chinese state propaganda outlets gleefully covered Kerry's remarks, embracing his notion of a climate partnership.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Tom Wright pointed out in the Atlantic, this fits perfectly into Beijing's calls for a reset of U.S.-China relations, which from Beijing's perspective requires Washington to back off from confronting the Chinese government's behavior on a range of issues, including its military expansion, economic aggression and internal repression.\\n\\nBiden transition officials told me that there is broad recognition inside the team that the challenges of 2021 are quite different from those in 2016, and therefore require fresh thinking. When the entire team is revealed, there will be lots of new voices to promote new approaches to go along with the seasoned veterans, these officials said.\\n\\nThere is evidence some incoming Biden officials are adapting their views to changed conditions. When asked about the new administration's China approach Sunday on CNN, Sullivan spoke in terms that stood in sharp contrast to the accommodationist rhetoric of the Obama years. He said that Biden wants to first consult with allies in Europe and Asia to talk about how together we can bring leverage to bear on China to change its most problematic trade abuses, before jointly engaging with Beijing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe elevation of Sullivan and Finer represents some generational turnover. But other younger former Obama national security officials — now vying for jobs in the incoming administration — told me they feel frustrated with the lack of upward mobility because of the clog of older people at the top who won't leave the stage. There's also frustration among the progressive foreign policy wing of the Democratic Party, which has been publicly airing its own lists of candidates (a practice that usually backfires for those doing the airing).\\n\\nThe Biden team is pledging to mend alliances, re-engage international organizations and restore respect for the professional bureaucracy. This team seems well-suited for these initial tasks. But once this low-hanging fruit is picked, the mission gets harder. The famous Obama foreign policy focus on pragmatism and process seems ill-suited for the current grave strategic environment because it tilts the scales of policymaking toward rumination and away from decisive action.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFour years of Trump's erratic and incompetent foreign policy has left the Biden team with a steep uphill path to restoring U.S. international influence and leadership, which is urgently needed to solve urgent and complex international problems. But competence alone is not a strategy."}
{"original": "As the sole Democrat on Georgia's state election board on Sunday urged Raffensperger to investigate the president over the call, some lawyers and legal scholars said Trump's actions indeed appeared to violate both state and federal criminal statutes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn social media, much of the conversation among legal observers and Trump critics revolved around a federal statute, 52 U.S. Code 20511, which makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully deprive or defraud a state's residents of a free or fair election — or to attempt to do so.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general under President Barack Obama, shared the text of that statute on Twitter on Sunday. As you listen to the tape consider this federal criminal statute, Holder wrote.\\n\\nThe question, according to Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University, is whether Trump was knowingly and willfully pressuring Raffensperger to count nonexistent votes when he told the GOP official, I just want to find 11,780 votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn other words: Does Trump actually believe that 11,780 ballots in his favor were cast but not counted?\\n\\nConsidering that two recounts, an audit and several judges have upheld President-elect Joe Biden's win in Georgia, Levitt said it is clear Trump was not pushing for an honest tally of the votes.\\n\\nEither the president was engaged in the commission of a felony, he said, or he has lost his hold on reality such that he can no longer distinguish fact from the fictions he has been fed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMichael R. Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general, put it more bluntly on Twitter: His best defense would be insanity.\\n\\nSince 52 U.S. Code 20511 was adopted as part of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, it has been used sparingly by federal prosecutors. It was used in 2005 to go after Milwaukee woman Kimberly Prude, who voted illegally in the city while still on probation. But Levitt said there is no precedent to use it against someone of Trump's stature.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther legal scholars said that Trump possibly violated 18 U.S. Code 241, which makes it illegal to participate in a conspiracy against people exercising their civil rights. That long-standing statute has been used frequently to prosecute acts of voter intimidation, especially those committed by the Ku Klux Klan against Black voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut charging Trump under that code would require prosecutors to show that someone else on the phone call was also aiding and abetting a scheme, Levitt said.\\n\\nAdditionally, Trump's apparent threat of criminal consequences if Raffensperger failed to act could be seen as an attempt at extortion, The Post reported.\\n\\nOn the state level, Trump's call could also have violated a Georgia statute.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLeigh Ann Webster, a criminal defense attorney in Atlanta, told The Post that in Georgia, Trump could run afoul of a state law that makes it illegal to cause someone else to take part in election fraud — by soliciting, requesting or commanding it.\\n\\nThat's the same statute cited Sunday by David J. Worley, the Georgia election board member who asked Raffensperger to investigate Trump. In his email to the GOP official, Worley said that probable cause may exist to find violations of that law.\\n\\nIt's a crime to solicit election fraud, and asking the secretary to change the votes is a textbook definition of election fraud, Worley said in an interview with The Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe argument may be more straightforward compared to a potential federal case. Under the Georgia statute, Webster said the crime would be merely asking someone else to partake in one of several forms of election fraud, including interfering with the secretary of state's handling of an election.\\n\\nBut because such matters at the state level have rarely been interpreted in court, none of this is bulletproof, she said.\\n\\nAnd whether Trump broke federal state law, it's a different question of whether any prosecutor would try to charge him.\\n\\nUntil Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20, legal scholars say there is virtually no chance of federal charges being filed. Besides the short time frame, Levitt said, the Justice Department maintains a long-standing principle that a federal prosecutor may not prosecute a sitting president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo such principle exists once a commander in chief is out of office. Yet under a Biden administration juggling many competing priorities, going after Trump in the courts could be a politically fraught choice.\\n\\nTrevor Potter, a Republican and former Federal Election Commission chairman who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, told the New York Times there is a good argument that Trump was pushing for a fraudulent vote count during the call.\\n\\nBut even if the Biden Justice Department thinks they have a good case, is that how they want to start off the Biden presidency? he said. That is a policy decision."}
{"original": "Every winter, we ask Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big ideas, arguments, questions and problems that the new year will bring. Of course, if there's one thing we learned over the last 12 months, it's that what we don't expect can matter even more than what we do: The first cases of the unexplained pneumonia that would become the coronavirus pandemic, after all, were announced quietly on Dec. 30, 2019. What will be on our minds when we remember 2021 a year from now? Here is Outlook's fifth annual Year in Preview.\\n\\n— Mike Madden\\n\\nThe White House by Annie Linskey\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nBiden beat Trump. Now what?\\n\\nDemocratic voters could agree on the main goal through a messy primary race and a quarantined general election: They would put aside differences to defeat President Trump.\\n\\nAnnie Linskey is a national political reporter @AnnieLinskey\\n\\nBut now that President-elect Joe Biden has delivered on that central promise, there's less left to bind together the coalition that spanned from socialists who backed Bernie Sanders to suburban Republican women who once supported Mitt Romney. Keeping Democrats on the same page would help Biden enormously — if he can do it.\\n\\nAn early test will come Tuesday, when voters in Georgia go to the polls for two runoff elections. Biden carried the state in November, and if Democrats win both races — a difficult feat — his party will control the Senate by the narrowest of margins, giving him far more ability to drive the agenda in Congress than if Republicans hold the chamber.\\n\\nEven then, Democrats wouldn't have the votes to make structural changes to government, like ending the Senate filibuster, that would pave the way for more ambitious ideas. That means Biden probably won't be able to achieve big, transformational goals.\\n\\nSo far, he's setting out an early agenda focused on the twin health and economic crises, hoping that he can create bipartisan habits early by offering solutions to meet immediate needs for officials from both parties. Red and blue states want a vaccine, and Biden has promised to deliver it. Red and blue states need stimulus funds. He's promised more of that, too.\\n\\nBut Biden also ran on confronting climate change, reforming the immigration system, strengthening labor unions, addressing income inequality and overhauling the criminal justice system — all ideas that will be met with significant Republican resistance. All will test the decades-long dealmaking relationship that Biden has touted with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.\\n\\nFinally, though he was defeated at the ballot box and is leaving the White House, Trump still will have a place on the national stage. That leaves Biden with perhaps his most difficult task: overpowering Trumpism again.\\n\\nThe economy by Heather Long\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nOne nation, two recoveries\\n\\nThe U.S. economy is expected to come roaring back in 2021 as coronavirus vaccines become more widely available and Americans begin to venture out again to restaurants, workplaces and entertainment venues. Yet just as the recession hurt low-wage workers more than people in white-collar industries, the recovery will benefit some people much more quickly than others.\\n\\nHeather Long is an economics correspondent @byHeatherLong\\n\\nMany sectors of the economy should come on like a light switch once you have a vaccine, says Tim Duy, an economics professor at the University of Oregon. On top of the boom caused by businesses reopening, wealthier Americans will be looking to spend some of the substantial savings — more than $1 trillion — that they accumulated in 2020 as they worked from home and spent less on commuting, travel and nights out. That should also boost the economy.\\n\\nYet the recovery will continue to be K-shaped, as economists say, with already-well-off professionals heading steadily up as others struggle. Indeed, the split could get worse if additional government aid doesn't materialize or if even more jobs and small businesses don't return because consumer habits shift. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, for instance, think that economic growth will probably recover fully in 2021 but that employment won't return to precrisis levels until 2024.\\n\\nNearly 10 million jobs lost during the spring still have not returned — especially in restaurants, travel and education — a higher number than at the worst point of the Great Recession. In the post-vaccine world, millions of Americans will have to find new jobs (or entirely new careers), a process that takes time. And that burden is likely to fall disproportionately on Black workers. So far, Black Americans have recovered only 53 percent of the jobs they lost, compared with 66 percent for Whites (and 69 percent for Hispanics).\\n\\nEven as much of the economy bounces back, evictions could easily spike as protections fade away; millions of unemployed workers are severely behind on rent. And many services on which the poor and middle class depend could take a significant hit: Public education and public transportation, in particular, could face drastic cuts as cities and towns search for ways to close budget gaps caused by reduced tax revenue and the high costs of fighting the coronavirus. The pain will linger for low-wage workers even as many economic headlines turn rosy again.\\n\\nSports by Jerry Brewer\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nHow to make games fun without fans\\n\\nOur obsession with sports seemed unstoppable until it was pitted against an intractable pandemic. Then everything halted in 2020 for several months, and when the games returned, they were sterile, inspiring uneasy feelings and poor television ratings. Like everything else infected by the novel coronavirus, athletics were literally sickening.\\n\\nJerry Brewer is a sports columnist @JerryBrewer\\n\\nThe hope of a new year and an effective vaccine provides a spiritual jolt but not an immediate elixir. Professional and major college sports will remain in survival mode throughout 2021, desperate to reinvent how they engage with fans and eager to see the day when tens of thousands can gather in their venues once again.\\n\\nDespite some incredible athletic performances amid the duress, it has been difficult to present sports on television without large numbers of fans. The TV tricks — fresh camera angles, manufactured crowd noise, dabbling with greater interactivity — couldn't prevent the product from being a glorified scrimmage. For die-hard fans, the outcomes carried emotional value, but it was hard to get past the practical reality: These weren't events as much as they were staged replicas to satisfy lucrative TV contracts.\\n\\nWhile awaiting normalcy, sports executives must be more creative in doing something that will seem novel to them: finding a dependable audience. And they must do so with limited resources. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said 40 percent of the league's revenue comes from game nights at arenas. Other sports are similar — and some are even more dependent on live events. Vaccines notwithstanding, teams don't expect a fast return to regular times. All are concerned about how long they can hold on while experiencing extreme revenue shortfalls.\\n\\nTheir business models are built on the endurance of the sports obsession, which normally provides even when teams don't have a good on-field product. Adjusting to life without a financial autopilot will only grow more challenging.\\n\\nMost will survive. Some will crumble. The way sports operate won't fundamentally change; executives will view this as a once-a-century predicament. But as technology alters viewing habits and younger generations consider how much money they're willing to commit to fandom, the pandemic has exposed an urgent need to diversify. Experimentation should begin in earnest.\\n\\nClimate by Sarah Kaplan\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nA 2020 repeat — but this time, on purpose\\n\\nA year ago, United Nations scientists issued a dire warning to humanity: To keep global warming within tolerable limits, we need to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an unheard-of 7.6 percent annually. Twelve months later, though, the world just about hit that target — unintentionally, and at the terrible cost of more than 1.5 million lives. The coronavirus shutdowns and resulting economic devastation led to the biggest decline in planet-warming emissions in human history: about 7 percent.\\n\\nSarah Kaplan is a climate reporter @sarahkaplan48\\n\\nIn 2021, the world will need to reduce emissions on the same scale while simultaneously controlling the coronavirus and rebuilding the economy.\\n\\nThere are reasons to be optimistic, said Surabi Menon, vice president of global intelligence at ClimateWorks Foundation and a member of the steering committee for the U.N.'s emissions gap reports. The European Union, South Korea and Japan have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero by 2050. China says it will do so by 2060. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's election signals the United States' return to international climate diplomacy. With history's biggest emitter back in the Paris agreement, climate experts hope countries will be motivated to pledge deeper emissions reductions at the U.N. climate conference in November.\\n\\nGovernments are expected to spend nearly $13 trillion to help their countries recover from the pandemic, offering an unprecedented chance to fund research on green technology and transition away from fossil fuels. If stimulus packages are invested the right way, the International Energy Agency has found, they could trim expected 2030 emissions by as much as 25 percent. Not since the end of World War II has society seen such an opportunity to reinvent itself.\\n\\nBut if humanity does not reverse course on climate change in the coming year, we will find ourselves locked into escalating warming for decades to come. This is the one chance we have, German climatologist Niklas Höhne told The Post. Governments will not spend this much money again in 10 years.\\n\\nrestaurants by Tim Carman\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nDitch the kitchen 'concept,' chefs\\n\\nConcept has always been king for restaurants. The concept, or business plan, informs everything: what food is served and how, the decor and tableware, the marketing and target customers, the selection of employees, the location, even the name of the place. The success of a restaurant, the thinking went, flowed directly from the originality of its concept and its owners' ability to stick to it. Straying from the plan was an indication of weakness, and a sure warning sign to customers and investors that the business was doomed.\\n\\nTim Carman is a food reporter and restaurant critic @timcarman\\n\\nBut if the pandemic has proved anything, it's that restaurant business plans are meant to be scrapped, or at least adapted. White-tablecloth restaurateurs have simplified menus to pivot into carryout and third-party delivery. Chefs have carved out spaces in the back of the house for ghost kitchens selling comfort foods far removed from their original concepts, available just for takeaway or delivery. Operators have opened small retail markets, subleased spaces for pop-ups or developed branded products to sell in retail stores. Flexibility and adaptability have become keys to survival, and no one bats an eye when, say, a refined seafood restaurant now sells chicken parm, meatloaf, and mac and cheese.\\n\\nWith labor and overhead costs rising for years, the restaurant industry was obviously ripe for reinvention. In the fall, chef, restaurateur and media darling David Chang told Fortune magazine that, even before the pandemic, he had set a long-term goal to generate 50 percent of his revenue from consumer goods, not from the four walls of a restaurant. The Momofuku Group had a five-year plan, and now we've tried to accelerate that into six months, Chang said.\\n\\nChefs and restaurateurs will continue to blow up their concepts in 2021. No one knows for sure when diners will feel comfortable sitting inside restaurants again, which means operators at all levels will continue to devote resources to takeout, ghost kitchens and other solutions. But the pandemic has also forced countless owners to go into debt, including back rent, and restaurateurs who survive this mess will need to diversify their revenue streams to help settle those accounts.\\n\\nThe good news, if you want to call it that, is that older restaurants (the ones whose owners complain about never getting media coverage) can reinvent and reinvigorate themselves, and no one will call them desperate. Diversification is now just baked into the business plan.\\n\\npandemic by Leonard Bernstein\\n\\nJordy van den Nieuwendijk for The Washington Post (For The Washington Post)\\n\\nVaccines will help, but normal is still elusive\\n\\nWhen will life return to normal?\\n\\nChances are, no single question will be asked more often as the new year begins and 2020, one of the darkest periods in U.S. history, comes to a merciful end.\\n\\nLeonard Bernstein is a health and medicine reporter @Leonard Bernstein\\n\\nWith the delivery of the first doses of vaccine to hospitals in mid-December, the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel grew a bit brighter. The initial shipment of 2.9 million doses was enough only to start inoculating health-care workers and nursing-home residents. But it portended the beginning of the end — the hope that by the middle of 2021, perhaps, anyone who wanted to be vaccinated against the coronavirus could be.\\n\\nAs always, there are questions: Are the vaccines safe? Will they have side effects? Will the difficult task of transporting and delivering them be accomplished? And most important, will enough Americans be willing to take them?\\n\\nScientists say 70 to 80 percent of us must, in order for all to be protected against the virus. Polls showed acceptance of the idea edging into that range as 2020 ended. And that was before a campaign to persuade the reluctant began in earnest. So when will life return to normal?\\n\\nMasks, social distancing and frequent hand-washing still will be features of the first half of the year. Gathering with loved ones, working together without fear and sending children to school campuses full-time may have to wait until the fall.\\n\\nBut if all goes well — a plausible if difficult-to-reach outcome — the latter part of 2021 could look more like 2019, before the pandemic altered life as we knew it.\\n\\nspace by Christian Davenport\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nSpace Force is here to stay\\n\\nBetween his over-the-top salesmanship — one tweet read, simply, SPACE FORCE. VOTE! — and the Star Trek-esque branding, the U.S. Space Force will forever be associated with President Trump. But while some are urging President-elect Joe Biden to eliminate his predecessor's prized program, that's not likely to happen.\\n\\nChristian Davenport is a defense and space industries reporter @wapodavenport\\n\\nIn 2020, the Space Force became the first new military branch since the Air Force was established in 1947, in part because of bipartisan support in Congress, which concluded that space — like the land, sea and air — is a warfighting domain that needs to be defended. It's here to stay, said Rep. Kendra Horn (D-Okla.), who lost her reelection bid but served on the House Armed Services Committee and as chair of a subcommittee on space. It was not about this administration — this was a long-term, thoughtful and bipartisan effort looking at the current and future needs of our national security.\\n\\nWith American military satellites guiding precision munitions and everyday traffic — yes, that blue GPS dot on your phone comes courtesy of the Pentagon — there is a lot at stake in space. And it isn't just superpowers competing for the high ground.\\n\\nSpace has also become a new front in corporate battles funded by billionaire entrepreneurs. There's a race to flood Earth's orbit with satellites that would beam the Internet to billions of people without access to broadband. And there's the human race: Having flown NASA astronauts to the International Space Station for the first time in 2020, Elon Musk's SpaceX is ahead of rival Boeing, which stumbled in the development of its new capsule. Both companies plan to fly astronauts in 2021, and SpaceX is even planning a launch that could ferry private space tourists.\\n\\nRichard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin are also looking toward space tourism, starting with flights for wealthy travelers that would not reach orbit, grazing the edge of space before returning to Earth. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Both companies expect to start flights in 2021.\\n\\nThose tourists won't run into any uniformed military up there, however. Eventually, the Space Force may train a corps of guardians as astronauts — after all, its motto is Semper Supra, Always Above. But that day is a long way off. For now, the newest military branch is just trying to determine where on Earth its headquarters will be located.\\n\\nSupreme Court by Robert Barnes\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nIt's Amy Coney Barrett's court now\\n\\nFor a while now, the Supreme Court's essential question has been, What does Chief Justice John Roberts want? Starting in 2021, the central question might become, What does Justice Amy Coney Barrett think?\\n\\nCourt commentators struggled at the end of the term last July to find words to describe Roberts's influence. He was a part of every majority as the court decided cases involving some of the nation's most controversial issues: abortion, gun control, religious liberty, legal protections for LGBT workers and President Trump's sweeping claims of executive autonomy.\\n\\nRobert Barnes is a reporter covering the U.S. Supreme Court @scotusreporter\\n\\nBut there already are signs that Barrett's replacement of liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg could diminish Roberts's pivotal role. Barrett provided the fifth and decisive vote to do away with the court's general deference to local officials regarding pandemic restrictions — the position Roberts had championed. She joined fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to strike a blow for religious organizations that had chafed at what they said were unconstitutional boundaries on their right to worship.\\n\\nThe right is looking at Barrett's judicial record and daring to dream big again. As a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, Barrett abided by the court's precedents on restricting protesters from the doors of abortion clinics and health centers. But she and fellow judges criticized the jurisprudence as incoherent. Conservative lawyers are hoping that a case from Pittsburgh will allow Barrett and like-minded colleagues to ease or eliminate the limitations.\\n\\nOne of her most important opinions as a circuit court judge was an against-the-grain dissent that said felons should not necessarily be forbidden from gun ownership. Such a deprivation of Second Amendment rights should depend on whether a person is dangerous, she wrote, not the classification of his crime. The Firearms Policy Coalition has filed a petition on behalf of a Pennsylvania man similarly barred from gun ownership, which could provide the chance for the court's new conservative majority to consider the issue anew.\\n\\nRoberts is a conservative, of course, but one who has been wary of advancing the court's movement on gun control and abortion too far and too fast. On these and other issues, Barrett might not be so reluctant.\\n\\nTheater by Peter Marks\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nBlack Lives Matter comes to Broadway\\n\\nTheater blooms in the fertile ground of political turmoil. It's one of the form's most resilient characteristics. Revolt sometimes springs directly from the stage; a dissident Czech playwright, the late Vaclav Havel, after all, rose out of revolution to lead a country away from Soviet domination.\\n\\nPeter Marks is a theater critic @petermarksdrama\\n\\nSo if the pandemic-driven shutdown of 2020 imposed an existential crisis on theater in this country, a simultaneous upheaval — the widespread protests over white supremacy, spurred by a reinvigorated Black Lives Matter movement — has created the conditions for a revolution on the stage in 2021.\\n\\nLook, then, for a renaissance, on Broadway and other stages, in plays by Black artists and other people of color. The groundwork is being laid — if the coronavirus vaccines are distributed fast enough — for a return to live performance with far more input from generations of Black playwrights, directors and administrators. As a result, the theater world will find itself connected in a profound way to the world evolving just outside the playhouse doors.\\n\\nThe seeds of a new order are already apparent: In October, the Tony Awards belatedly announced the nominees for Broadway's truncated 2019-20 season, which ended in early March. The searing seriocomedy Slave Play, by a young Black dramatist making his Broadway debut, Jeremy O. Harris, garnered an astonishing 12 nominations — the most ever for a nonmusical.\\n\\nEven before vaccines were authorized, Thoughts of a Colored Man, by Keenan Scott II, the stories set in Brooklyn of seven Black men, was scheduled for a reopened Broadway. And the long, long-awaited Broadway debut of Alice Childress's Trouble in Mind — a brilliant 1955 backstage comedy-drama about racism in the rehearsal room — will come via New York's Roundabout Theatre Company.\\n\\nBlack playmaking, of course, has been a vibrant aspect of the American theater for decades; Lynn Nottage, Suzan-Lori Parks and Jackie Sibblies Drury are among the Black writers who have won Pulitzer Prizes for drama over the past two decades. In the wings now, an accelerated recognition of the creative power of theater artists of color is waiting for us all.\\n\\nPop culture by Emily Yahr\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nCelebrity in the palm of your hand\\n\\nThe love affair between celebrities and Instagram Live is poised to grow in 2021. Not only have direct broadcasts over the Internet become an easy pandemic-era way for stars to endear themselves to fans with near-guaranteed publicity, but the celebrities have complete control over what they say. They don't need to write a witty caption or agonize over the perfect filter; viewers crave — and expect — authenticity in a spontaneous real-time chat.\\n\\nEmily Yahr is an entertainment reporter @EmilyYahr\\n\\nIn 2020, Selena Gomez revealed her bipolar diagnosis on Miley Cyrus's Instagram Live series and said she felt comfortable sharing the news there because she liked the rawness of the show. Stars chatted with their co-stars, interviewed politicians, held cocktail hours, patched up old feuds, spilled details on future projects and even streamed their daughter's stuffed-animal wedding (that was Chrissy Teigen and John Legend).\\n\\nOne unfortunate side effect is that the trend of celebrities preferring to interview each other rather than face questions from journalists will endure. There's no doubt that this new model will remain popular — especially because fans feel even more connected to their favorite stars in such casual settings. Of course, some stars will feel so at home, they will basically forget that they're speaking to millions, leading to controversies. Just look at actress Vanessa Hudgens, who went live to shrug off the pandemic in March, noting that people are going to die, which is terrible — but inevitable? (She later apologized.)\\n\\nMusicians have been some of the most frequent users of the streaming platform, keeping their performance muscles strong while tours have been shut down. That development may fade as life slowly returns to normal, but Instagram did recently announce that it's expanding live streams to a maximum of four hours instead of just one — so as we start the new year, much of our entertainment will still be found in the Instagram app, just as it was for much of 2020.\\n\\nEducation by Laura Meckler\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe great academic catch-up\\n\\nChildren are likely to return en masse to school buildings in 2021, wrapping up our involuntary national experiment with home schooling. But the effects of the pandemic on American education will extend long beyond the end of Zoom school. And even before the fights over reopening campuses have ended, attention is turning to the next challenge: How to help children make up the ground they've lost. One answer, experts say, could be an unprecedented large-scale tutoring program.\\n\\nLaura Meckler is a national education writer @laurameckler\\n\\nSignificant academic damage to children has already been recorded, particularly in math, as students have struggled to connect and teachers have struggled to teach remotely. Students of color and those in low-income families are seeing the steepest losses — exacerbating existing inequities. In a December report, the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. predicted that White students could lose the equivalent of eight months of math if schools stayed closed through June, while students of color could lose as much as 12 months. McKinsey estimates that high-intensity tutoring to cover half of U.S. students would cost $66 billion (at $2,500 per student), and advocates hope the federal government and private foundations will pay the bill.\\n\\nIt's a big tab, and it's far from a sure thing that there will be any money. Still, research — including a recent meta-analysis of 96 tutoring programs by J-PAL North America, an MIT lab focused on poverty issues — suggests that well-executed tutoring programs are effective at helping students catch up quickly, even more than other large-scale interventions (including reducing class sizes, providing additional training for teachers or purchasing new curriculums).\\n\\nTo be effective, experts say, tutoring needs to be consistent — at least two or three hours a week, for at least several months. The best programs are embedded within schools so that learning aligns with the local curriculum (and so students show up). Tutors don't necessarily have to be teachers, however: Lower-paid paraprofessionals have nearly as much success, the research shows.\\n\\nSchools are already strapped for cash, tax collections are down, and it's been hard to pry funding out of Washington. If districts are left on their own, there's little doubt that wealthy ones will be far better positioned to help kids catch up than their higher-need, higher-poverty counterparts. Schools appear eager to ramp up tutoring in 2021, but who will pay for the project — if anyone — is far less clear.\\n\\nforeign by Ishaan Tharoor\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nReversing Trump's havoc on the world stage\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden promises a grand restoration of American leadership on the world stage. As soon as he enters the White House, he will try to reverse some of the havoc wreaked by President Trump abroad. He'll rescind the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization, return to the Paris climate accords and start salvaging the nuclear deal with Iran.\\n\\nIshaan Tharoor is a columnist covering foreign affairs, geopolitics and history @ishaantharoor\\n\\nBut Biden and the myriad Obama-era veterans in his administration also have grander ambitions, beyond setting the clock back to 2016: He says he aims to counter the global tide of rising authoritarianism. His aides have floated new geopolitical groupings that would prioritize human rights and liberal values, an alliance of democracies that could serve as a counterweight to autocrats and elected illiberal strongmen. Biden also says he'll put the world's kleptocrats on notice and bring greater transparency to the global financial system. Targeting corruption and illicit tax havens, the thinking goes, would chip away at the inequities that fuel nationalist populism.\\n\\nOn all those fronts, the new administration will have its work cut out. On climate, any collaboration with China — the world's biggest carbon emitter but also an emerging green-tech giant — will be met with Republican fury at home. On Iran, the landscape has markedly changed after four years of Trumpist maximum pressure; trust between all parties is low. On challenging authoritarianism and upholding liberal values, the mixed record of Biden's own time in office as vice president — which saw the sputtering of democratic revolutions in the Arab world and unchecked military adventurism by Russia — suggests that a liberal renaissance may not be around the corner.\\n\\nUltimately, no foreign policy priority in 2021 will matter as much as Biden's ability to lift the country out of the pandemic. Other nations are hoping that Washington can help lead efforts to distribute vaccines in the developing world, but the United States still has a long struggle ahead to heal itself. No matter Biden's avowed internationalism, the era of America First may not be over just yet.\\n\\nfilm by Stephen Zeitchik\\n\\n(For The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe movies come home\\n\\nIn theory, 2021 should be the year of massive movies. After all, a slew of films that didn't come out during a pandemic-stricken 2020 were pushed to 2021 — a list that includes the James Bond installment No Time to Die, Marvel's Black Widow, the Quiet Place sequel, a new Fast & Furious film and even Steven Spielberg's West Side Story.\\n\\nStephen Zeitchik is a reporter covering the business of entertainment in the U.S. @zeitchikWaPo\\n\\nWhat reality will look like is another question. We know that at least a few movies will be coming — Warner Bros. says it will make available all 17 of its scheduled films, including Dune and In the Heights, on HBO Max, no matter how many theaters it can put them in. But that still leaves four other major studios, including every big movie from Disney, in limbo.\\n\\nThere are two likely scenarios. In one, the virus quiets down, thanks to the vaccine, a few months into the year. People quickly feel comfortable returning to theaters (and enough of those theaters hang on until then), and the rest of 2021 is a bonanza, a cinematic splashdown the likes of which the world has never seen.\\n\\nIn the second scenario, the vaccine doesn't bring us to herd immunity as quickly, keeping cities — and theaters — closed. You might assume that studios would then move many films to streaming, as Warner Bros. has already done.\\n\\nNot necessarily. A number of these titles cost $200 million or more to make. Studios can earn that back fast in theaters if a movie does well. On streaming only? Not so much. While studios often take upward of 60 percent of theatrical ticket sales in the United States, streaming dollars can be measured only in subscribers acquired or retained — and, given that one title rarely compels a subscription, sometimes not even that. Most studios would rather relax and recoup than rush and lose.\\n\\nThat's especially true for Disney, which doesn't need these films to supercharge its already-robust Disney Plus service. Executives know that billions await if they just hold out. In fact, it's not even clear that all of Warner Bros.' films will really be on HBO Max. A few of them, such as Dune, have deals or financial backers that may not give the studio the final say.\\n\\nSo 2021 probably won't be the year of big movies on your small screen. It will either be the year of cinema or the year of waiting — two futures battling it out as fiercely, and uncertainly, as the Sharks and the Jets."}
{"original": "I am not sure what to believe in this area. On the one hand, many anecdotes suggest that pressures to manage earnings hold back investment. And the short termism view is very widely believed.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some of what is done in the name of long term may be unmonitored waste. The observation that many unicorn companies with no profits, and sometimes no revenue or even fully developed products, get valued so highly makes me skeptical of the idea that the capital market is systematically myopic. It is also the case that the companies generating the highest immediate cash flows — which should be overvalued on the myopia theory — historically have had the highest stock market returns, implying undervaluation rather than overvaluation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI was therefore excited to see that McKinsey had a new empirical study that provides evidence in favor of the view that corporations should take longer views. They have a reasonable methodology. They divide their sample between companies that take a long-term view and those that do not and then compare their performance. They find that companies that take a long-term view perform better on many metrics such as employment growth and shareholder return.\\n\\nTheir findings deserve much discussion, debate and attempts at replication. At this point, though, I would give a Scottish verdict of not proven to their case. They may be right, but I do not think they have provided evidence that would convince anyone other than a prior believer.\\n\\nConsider an analogy. It is doubtless the case that golfers with long swings such as Phil Mickelson hit the ball farther and more accurately than golfers with short swings like myself. An index of swing length would be highly correlated with almost any measure of golf performance. Does this mean I should lengthen my swing? I doubt it. Those with more flexibility and coordination are able to take and control longer swings and play golf better. If I were to try to swing like Mickelson, I would mishit the ball and maybe break my back.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome companies have great ideas, great management teams and compelling strategies. They invest heavily, seek to grow revenue, ignore the management of earnings and do limited stock buybacks. These are the criteria McKinsey uses to measure long termism. Others lack vision and have mediocre management. They invest less, cut costs more, manage earnings and buy back stock. McKinsey deems them short-term focused.\\n\\nIt's no surprise that the long-term companies outperform the short-term companies. But this may be because of their vision and execution capacity, not their long-term focus. Mediocre companies seeking to imitate them will be like me trying to imitate Mickelson — painful failures. I do not see any basis in the McKinsey results for saying that companies should extend their horizons.\\n\\nMcKinsey tries to address this issue by doing comparisons within industries. But everything we know suggests that there are substantial differences in company quality within industries as well as across industries.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAgain, it may be that the long-termism hypothesis is right, and there may be ways of teasing causality out of the very interesting data set that McKinsey has created. But at this point, I think the issue is still unresolved."}
{"original": "Others fall somewhere in between. We asked several experts on workplace technology, data, compensation and other issues to make predictions on the rest — their bets on the likely-but-not-obvious trends they believe will take hold, the challenges managers will face and the new perks employees could see. Some are quirky — a phone booth in the office? — while others will remind us of the risks that exist for our personal data at work. Here are five trends you may see when you're back in the office to start the new year.\\n\\nBENEFITS: Family leave for non-parents will become more common\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn recent years, extended parental leave — even a promised year off at some tech companies — has become all the rage for new mothers and even fathers as companies try to recruit and retain millennial workers. But Carol Sladek, who leads Aon's work-life consulting program, believes more companies in 2019 will start to extend family leave to non-parents who want time off to care for an aging parent, grieve for a lost family member or help with a sick spouse.\\n\\nIt's come up in almost every conversation I've had in the last six months, she says of her discussions with clients. More companies may decide to broaden family leave coverage out of a sense of equity, as employees sense that  'I'm sitting here trying to care for my 83-year-old father, and Jane, sitting next to me, gets 18 weeks of paid maternity leave. That doesn't feel right,'  she said.\\n\\nWhile the Family and Medical Leave Act allows employees to take up to 12 weeks to care for an ailing family member, many employees don't know about it, and it only guarantees unpaid time off. A benefit of paid leave for family care may not explode in 2019, Sladek said, but she expects enough growth that Aon plans to include it in its annual benefits surveys. Organizations are getting that 'Aha, we solved that problem, but we missed this group.' \\n\\nCOMPENSATION: A wage gap between old and new workers will create new headaches\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the labor market remains tight and people switch jobs more often, there's a different kind of wage gap forming, said Brian Kropp, the group vice president for Gartner's human resources practice. Companies have to dangle more to lure in new workers, making pay disparity grow between workers who've been in a job with a company for years and those who've been newly recruited.\\n\\nIn today's labor market, the best way to get a raise is to go find a job at another company, Kropp said. Employers are not as willing to pay more for the people they've got. It's a really interesting dynamic.\\n\\nYet as pay transparency becomes more common — with more employees opening up about what they are paid or websites such as Glassdoor making such data more available — the problem could lead to morale issues between workers and headaches for managers. Companies, Kropp said, will need to make more-frequent adjustments. Too many companies don't do that, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey haven't done the follow-through, he said. In some places, it could get worse.\\n\\nBut Laura Sejen, a managing director with Willis Towers Watson, says the increased focus on the gender pay gap and pay equity should help address gaps that occur between incoming and existing workers.\\n\\nIf not all, a large majority of organizations, as part of their annual pay review cycle, are now including a gender pay equity analysis, she said. Whether they did the initial analysis two years ago or five months ago, they've been moving fairly systematically.\\n\\nPRIVACY: Workers will demand that employers do more to insure their personal data\\n\\nA global awakening about threats to the privacy of our data as consumers will spill over into concerns about the personal data we give our employers, predicts Kristina Bergman, the CEO of Integris Software, which helps organizations manage the personal information they store and meet compliance mandates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are an increasing number of protections in place for consumers — things like the ability to opt in and opt out, or needing consent to use their data, she said. Employees, however, have less control over how their employers use their data. Yet plenty of data is at risk. Beyond social security numbers and bank account information from direct deposits, data like what movies you watched in a hotel room on a business trip (charged to a corporate credit card) or what vacation days you took could reveal other personal tastes or even religious information to outside parties.\\n\\nBergman predicts more pressure for employers to provide some of the same options to their workers that customers have, such as being able to request access to information that companies have about them.\\n\\nI think what they'll start to demand is that employers specify a certain duty of care when it comes to dealing with their data, Bergman said. I think it will become part of their marketing pitch, in the same way benefits packages are, as employers start to disclose how they treat employers' data, too, and use that as an indicator of the moral and ethical fabric of the company.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOFFICE DESIGN: The office phone booth will become a workplace staple\\n\\nPeople may hate the open office design — and there are plenty of reasons to, including their stifling of collaboration and the incessant noise and lack of concentration — but it's probably here to stay, albeit with design tweaks around the edges: more small conference rooms and collaboration areas for people to find some privacy or host a meeting. Furniture designs that allow people to put up barriers around their desk.\\n\\nAnd increasingly, says Jonathan Webb, vice president of workplace strategy at the design firm KI, office phone booths or privacy pods for people to have private conversations without taking up an entire meeting room designed for a larger group.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile they've already begun showing up in some workplaces, such booths are poised to become commonplace in 2019, Webb says.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPeople are going to start to figure out how to make these things more efficiently — lowering the high price for companies to purchase them — and make them a little more flexible in their design, he said. (KI is working on its own version, he said.) The Wall Street Journal reported in November that in 2015, only one booth-maker was part of the commercial-design industry's trade show in Chicago. In 2018, there were more than a dozen.\\n\\nAs the cost of real estate continues to increase and the size of individual workspaces continues to decrease, we have this issue of letting employees have different work styles to allow them to conduct all kinds of different business, he said — including the lost art of the private phone call at work.\\n\\nWORKPLACE TECH: Email will move past its peak and continue its demise\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCompanies have been moving toward messaging and away from email for internal communications for years, but 2019 will be the year email moves past its peak — at least at work, predicts Josh Bersin, an industry analyst who studies workplace technology.\\n\\nIf you're working with less than 200 people at a time, you really don't need email — it's a waste, he said.\\n\\nThe popularity of messaging tools such as Slack will continue, he said, but he also believes greater adoption of Microsoft's Teams — its take on the group messaging app that's integrated into Office 365 — will be a game-changer. Although Teams was released in 2017, it's still being adopted or turned on by many corporate IT departments, and Bersin believes 2019 will be the year it takes off because of how closely it's embedded with other Microsoft software or features.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBoth Bersin and Kropp also see greater adoption of workplace tech tools that nudge managers or employees via texts or other alerts that could divert users, too, from traditional emails (though the nudges are likely to come through email initially, too). From reminding managers with a phone alert that an employee in a competitive field hasn't had a raise to nudging people within an HR software system about using their remaining days of paid time off, artificial intelligence is likely to do more and more to urge behaviors among managers and employees. (Former Google HR chief Laszlo Bock is behind one start-up working in this area, Humu.)\\n\\nI think it's a new communications paradigm at work — a paradigm of nudges, texts and alerts, Bersin said. That is, until we overload that channel, too."}

{"original": "The raids, which involved more than 1,000 officers, marked the most dramatic onslaught in Chinese President Xi Jinping's transformation of once freewheeling Hong Kong into a city gripped by fear under authoritarian rule. China has moved in recent months to reshape Hong Kong institutions, including schools, the media and the legislature, and observers warned that the sweep signaled more to come.\\n\\nOn July 1, China implemented an authoritarian national security law aimed at stifling dissent and protests in Hong Kong, breaking its treaty with Britain. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nFar from preserving Hong Kong's way of life in the post-colonial era, as it promised, Beijing is deploying a variation of tactics honed in its repressive campaigns in Tibet and Xinjiang to crush Hong Kong civil society and political opposition, rights groups and activists say.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe idea of 'political opposition,' a common phenomenon in democratic systems, is seen by Beijing as inherently illegitimate, said Jude Blanchette, who holds the Freeman Chair in China Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It is tragic yet predictable that the Xi administration will continue to squeeze [Hong Kong] until there's total submission.\\n\\nCarl Minzner, an expert on Chinese law and governance at Fordham University, added that Beijing's control in Hong Kong, as in China's other restive peripheral regions, involves a particular emphasis on remodeling communities viewed as insufficiently patriotic and loyal through ideological education and mass arrests, and aims to co-opt institutions that Beijing feels it does not fully control.\\n\\nJohn Lee, Hong Kong's secretary for security, lauded the police operation as necessary and accused those involved in the primary vote of attempting to paralyze the government by seeking to win a majority in the legislature. Police said that more people could be arrested and that the investigation was ongoing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe government will not tolerate subversion of state power, Lee said. This is severe, and we will prosecute accordingly.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Chinese central government's liaison office in Hong Kong said in a statement Wednesday that the office firmly supported the Hong Kong police and government in the detentions. The statement called the national security law a turning point from chaos to rule of law.\\n\\nHong Kong has emerged as a major point of tension in the U.S.-China relationship, posing a challenge for the incoming Biden administration. Under President Trump, Washington imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials responsible for undermining freedoms in the city and ceased special trade privileges for Hong Kong.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAntony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's nominee for secretary of state, said in a tweet that the arrests were an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights and that the new administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA statement from British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the mass arrests a grievous attack on Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and said Chinese authorities deliberately misled the world about the true purpose of the National Security Law, which is being used to crush dissent and opposing political views.\\n\\nPunished over a primary\\n\\nThe dozens of people arrested Wednesday were either candidates in or had helped facilitate a primary in July designed to select pro-democracy candidates who would run in legislative elections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHeld days after Beijing enacted the new security law that sharply curtailed freedoms in Hong Kong, the primary vote symbolized defiance and a way for residents to express their will. Street protests against Beijing's tightening grip by that point had fizzled out because of the coronavirus pandemic and the new law, which imposes heavy prison sentences for broadly worded crimes such as secession and foreign interference.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShops and restaurants that support the democracy movement transformed into polling stations. Far exceeding expectations, over 600,000 people participated, choosing candidates who were more resistant to cooperation with Beijing than some of the more moderate stalwarts of the pro-democracy camp. They included activists Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho.\\n\\nBenny Tai, a legal scholar and activist who launched protests in 2014 that spiraled into a 79-day occupation of city streets, said that the primary represented a new form of civil disobedience, and that if the democratic camp had a majority in the legislature, it could stymie the Hong Kong government's efforts to achieve anything, even passing a budget. The primary was lauded by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who praised voters for making their voices heard in the face of the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to suffocate the territory's freedoms.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBeijing's liaison office declared the exercise illegal, saying that the goal of the opposition camp was to seize the ruling power of Hong Kong and that the candidates intended to carry out a color revolution. Lee on Wednesday added that the plan is to create mutual destruction, so that society jumps off the cliff.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOnly half of Hong Kong's legislature is elected. Its chief executive is selected from a field of candidates picked by Beijing, and then voted on by a committee of about 1,200 members.\\n\\nThe will of the people, however, was quashed by Hong Kong authorities, who disqualified many of the winning candidates and then postponed the elections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe sweep Wednesday also took aim at the media. Police served three independent Hong Kong news organizations with search warrants, demanding information related to the candidates and the vote, according to journalists working there.\\n\\nLau Siu-kai, a senior adviser to Beijing on Hong Kong policy, said the government had warned the pro-democracy camp not to go ahead with the primary.\\n\\nThe warning was defied and ignored, he said. The priority, he added, should be to safeguard national security.\\n\\nPresumption of guilt\\n\\nSeveral others, including billionaire media tycoon Jimmy Lai and a man who rode a motorcycle that rammed into police in unclear circumstances, had previously been arrested and charged under the national security law. Only Lai was briefly granted bail, a decision criticized by Chinese state media as contrary to the provisions in the security law. Hong Kong's top court subsequently revoked Lai's bail, sending him back to jail on New Year's Eve.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis precedent, legal experts and associates of those arrested Wednesday say, raises concern that they would not be granted bail if charged under the security law — leaving dozens in detention until formal hearings begin. Of the more than 50 arrested, many were defeated in the primary and have continued their work in the community and civil society, including Jeffrey Andrews, Hong Kong's first ethnic minority candidate to run in legislative elections and a longtime advocate of minority and refugee rights.\\n\\nOthers arrested included John Clancey, an American lawyer who represented one of the pro-democracy groups that organized the primary. A video shared widely Wednesday showed Clancey hobbling away from his office building on a single forearm crutch before police escorted him into a black van. The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nHong Kong democracy activists, a growing number of whom have fled to Western countries to avoid arrest and continue their advocacy, are lobbying the incoming Biden administration to impose tougher penalties on Beijing and for the European Union to call off an investment deal with China.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHuman rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, along with Western politicians, condemned the arrests as a blatant violation of peaceful expression and the right to association.\\n\\nBeijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle, said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch.\\n\\nOther experts on China, however, struck a more somber tone, pointing to the Chinese Communist Party's record.\\n\\nThe iron lesson Beijing has taken away from dealing with political disturbances, both large and small, over its 100-year history is that violence and a tarnished global reputation are always preferred over the possible success of democratic movements, said CSIS's Blanchette."}
{"original": "That decision caught Washington off-guard and sparked considerable controversy. But in the ensuing weeks, both Trump and administration officials have offered conflicting — and often confusing — statements about the timing of the exit and what the U.S. strategy in Syria entails.\\n\\nSo what is actually going on? Here's a rundown.\\n\\nHow did this start?\\n\\nTrump tweeted Dec. 19 that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had been defeated in Syria — a goal that he said was the only reason for a U.S. presence there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House later confirmed that the United States would move quickly to withdraw all its forces from Syria. They're all coming back, and they're coming back now, Trump said in a video message.\\n\\nPresident Trump said U.S. troops have succeeded in their mission to defeat the Islamic State in Syria in a video posted to Twitter on Dec. 19. (Reuters)\\n\\nTrump framed his decision to pull U.S. troops out as the fulfillment of a campaign promise. The president was a longtime critic of the Barack Obama administration's policy on fighting the Islamic State in Syria, writing in 2013 that the United States should stay the hell out of Syria.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIs that still the policy?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's allies have also suggested that the pullout plans are up in the air. After a meeting with the president on Dec. 30, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters that it was a pause situation rather than a pullout.\\n\\nAt the moment, it seems that no one knows when a pullout might occur. During a visit to Israel on Sunday, national security adviser John Bolton said that some objectives would have to be met before a withdrawal takes place. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a tweet on Monday, Trump claimed that the new timetable is no different from my original statements. He added: We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhy was there so much resistance to withdrawing the troops?\\n\\nMany of Trump's foreign policy advisers and allies support a strong line against Iran and view the U.S. presence in Syria as key to checking Tehran.\\n\\nAs recently as September, the State Department's special representative for Syria engagement, James Jeffrey, told reporters that the U.S. mission in Syria included the departure of all Iranian military and proxy forces and the installation of a stable new government. That means we are not in a hurry, Jeffrey said.\\n\\nAmong the Iran hawks was Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned the day after Trump announced his Syria move. In his resignation letter, Mattis said the president deserves a Pentagon chief who is better aligned with his views.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow many U.S. troops are in Syria at the moment?\\n\\nAbout 2,200 U.S. service members are in Syria. Although the Pentagon has released little information about the deployment, some details have spilled out: During the push to retake the city of Raqqa, the Islamic State's self-declared capital, in 2017, Special Operations forces and artillery soldiers were deployed there. Army Rangers also were sent to Syria to keep the peace between Syrian Kurdish fighters and forces loyal to Turkey.\\n\\nThere are also about 5,200 U.S. troops in neighboring Iraq, where they assist the government in the fight against the Islamic State. When Trump visited those troops Dec. 26, he suggested that we could use this as the base if we wanted to do something in Syria.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHas the Islamic State really been defeated?\\n\\nThe organization has lost almost all of the territory it held at its peak in 2014 and 2015. The U.S.-led military intervention that began during the Obama administration has helped with this, particularly the use of U.S. air power.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat effect could a pullout have on Syria's warring parties?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTurkey has emerged as a potential winner. Meanwhile, the prospect of a pullout has deeply alarmed the Syrian Kurdish forces allied with the United States. Turkey considers them terrorists and has vowed to drive them out of northeastern Syria. Bolton said Sunday that an agreement would be reached to keep the Kurds out of jeopardy, but Kurdish officials have told reporters that they are seeking a deal with President Bashar al-Assad's government just in case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAny agreement with the Kurds would be a boon for Assad, who has retaken control of much of the country. It would also be a win for Assad's allies in Russia and Iran. The Trump administration had earlier made countering Iran one of its key goals in the Middle East, but at a recent Cabinet meeting, Trump suggested that he wasn't worried about Iranian influence in Syria.\\n\\nThey can do what they want, Trump said of Iran in Syria on Thursday."}
{"original": "This happened on the day Trump promised he'd be handing out his Fake News Awards to journalists and outlets that he finds displeasing, an event that is just about as crazy and idiotic as you'd expect from this president.\\n\\nWhich raises a question: Is Trump losing his war on the media?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's been an underlying assumption that there is not only a method to this war, but that it carries political benefits for Trump. That was probably true during the 2016 election: The media's wide-eyed wonder at the Trump spectacle reduced his primary opponents to afterthoughts. It also meant that stories that would have ended the presidential bids of ordinary candidates were reported briefly and then pushed aside. Meanwhile, the media treated Hillary Clinton as someone who is fundamentally corrupt and whose every move should be greeted with screaming 72-point headlines.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd yet, through that campaign and for every day since, Trump has rained contempt and calumny upon journalists to a degree unprecedented in American life. During the election, the idea that the media was the enemy of him and everyone who loved him no doubt helped drive his supporters to the polls. But it may not be helping anymore.\\n\\nMany of President Trump's frequent jabs at the press have the ring of former president Richard Nixon's attacks on the media. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAs he has done on so many different topics, Trump has taken what others had implied and made it explicit. While Republicans built an alternative media apparatus on the notion that the mainstream media are hopelessly biased against them, Trump said outright that any story that didn't offer him the praise he felt he deserved was literally fake news. For Trump, reality is a joke and lying is as reflexive as breathing, and the war on the media hasn't been just about creating an alternate reality. It also involves relentless, angry, bitter, petty attacks on anyone who questions him. One of the consequences is that he has forced reporters to change how they operate — in ways that don't help him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor instance, Trump's extraordinarily promiscuous lying has lifted the journalistic taboo on saying a politician lied. The media may still use the term sparingly, but the presumption every other politician of any party is granted — that when they say something, they're telling the truth unless and until we have evidence otherwise — is no longer granted to the president. When he makes suspicious claims, reporters know they have to check them out, and will say forthrightly when they are false. Not all the time, of course, but more often than they've done in the past.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is also obvious that Trump's attempt to intimidate particular outlets and reporters — of which his Fake News Awards is only the latest and most cretinous example — hasn't tamed them in the way he wants. Journalists such as CNN's Jake Tapper or Jim Acosta have, if anything, become even more openly critical after Trump attacked them personally. Here again, the president took an old conservative tactic to an extreme, and it backfired. While conservatives found great success in charging reporters with liberal bias, which often led them to bend over backward to prove they were being objective, Trump's personal attacks have only caused reporters to dig in on their professionalism and demonstrate that they won't be cowed.\\n\\nThen there's the conservative information bubble. Trump wants his people to retreat further inside of it, so they'll never hear a discouraging word about him and his greatness. So how is that working out for him? Is it keeping his approval ratings from being the lowest of any president in history at this point in his term? Does it enable him to win arguments over things like whether he referred to shithole countries? Is it keeping Democrats from winning one stunning victory after another in off-year and special elections? Is it going to stave off the anti-Trump wave election in November that even some Republicans now believe they can do nothing to stop?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo one is more firmly ensconced inside that bubble than the president himself. Despite having the collective resources of the U.S. government at his disposal, he prefers to learn what's going on in the world from a daily three-hour immersion in the carnival of numbskullery that is Fox & Friends. But does this help Trump in any way? Does it allow him to make smart policy decisions or point him toward clever political strategies? He may watch for the unceasing ego massage the trio of nitwit hosts reliably deliver to him, but it can't help but make him dumber every time he tunes in."}
{"original": "Being a dog owner changes your children's poop. In fact, just by looking at a kid's feces, scientists can tell whether there's a pooch at home.\\n\\nThis is the sort of thing you can expect to learn more about on You Make Me Sick, a new podcast from the Environmental Defense Fund's Health Program. Hosted by Jennifer McPartland, a senior scientist with the Health Program, and Jonathan Choi, a chemical policy fellow there, it features chatty interviews with environmental-health experts who break down the latest findings in their fields.\\n\\nThe debut episode, which was released Jan. 30, dived deep into the effects of lead exposure. Summary: It's really bad. Next up is a conversation with Canadian microbiologist B. Brett Finlay, co-author of Let Them Eat Dirt: Saving Your Child From an Oversanitized World. His message is that we've gotten too obsessed with hygiene, managing to throw out the good microbes along with the bad ones.\\n\\n[Stop keeping your kids too clean]\\n\\nOne method he suggests for increasing your offspring's exposure to microbes is to get a dog. They muck about outdoors and then lick their little human friends like crazy, and this can reduce a kid's chance of asthma by 20 percent, Finlay says. (What does having a cat do? Nada.)\\n\\nFor folks in need of more microbes pronto, there's a more direct option: fecal transplants. It's what it sounds like: putting one person's waste into another.\\n\\nThe technique has been remarkably effective in some cases and has had mixed results in others. Finlay says the difference probably lies in the donor, because everyone has a different mix of microbes and no one knows which ones should be passed on. He predicts that researchers will someday be able to pinpoint a select set of microbes that can safely repoopulate a person.\\n\\nAnd there are some microbes we'd all be better off without, Finlay notes. For instance, there are the ones that start the process of turning red meat into hardening of the arteries. There are others, he adds, that seep into the gums of older people and cause dementia and Alzheimer's.\\n\\nUnfortunately, having a dog won't help with that.\\n\\n— Vicky Hallett"}
{"original": "Even if we imagine that the value of the dollar could instantly rise by 25%, circumventing the adjustment process, the list of unintended consequences would still be immense. Much of the world's public and private debt is denominated in dollars, and a rapid increase in the value of the dollar would cause massive financial upheavals and bankruptcies. A 25% increase in the dollar's value would imperil American investments abroad—including hundreds of billions of dollars in private and state pension funds and university endowments. The domestic tourism industry, which does not get a tax subsidy on its sales to foreigners visiting the U.S., would be devastated.\\n\\nBorder adjustment will be challenged under international trade agreements. Proponents tell us that not taxing exports is only treating our income tax like a value-added tax, which normally is not imposed on exports. But countries with VATs also have income taxes. Could the U.S. persuade the World Trade Organization that exempting exports from income taxes is the equivalent of doing so for a VAT or sales tax? That's doubtful, but if the answer is yes, other countries could do it as well—dissipating any U.S. advantage from subsidizing exports."}
{"original": "AD\\n\\nDemocrats are still trying to persuade Trump to open the government on a short-term basis to get people back to work and use that time to negotiate a border security deal. Democrats are willing to allocate money for border security enhancements but not new structural barriers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn early January, Trump told congressional leaders in a meeting that the shutdown could go on for months or even years. At the time, it seemed like an empty threat. Now it looks like a possibility.\\n\\nIt's hard to imagine how this will be resolved. So let's run through the various scenarios:\\n\\n1. Trump declares a national emergency\\n\\nAfter floating this option, Trump has said he has no plans to go this route, and most congressional Republicans have said it's not a good strategy. But if a legislative fix really can't be found, this could be a way out for all sides. In this scenario, Trump declares border security a national emergency, which he would argue allows him to reallocate money to build a wall. It would be challenged in the courts, and while it bounced around the legal system, the government would reopen with both sides being able to claim victory for not caving.\\n\\n2. Trump simply caves\\n\\nThe longer the shutdown goes on, the worse the ripple effect on the economy and for average Americans. If political pressure mounts, congressional Republicans could lean on Trump to reopen the government without border wall funding. In this scenario, he'd probably fight for an assurance from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that the Senate GOP would prioritize border security in the immediate aftermath. Then, if the Senate reached a compromise on border wall funding and a permanent fix to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, it's conceivable that Pelosi might feel an incentive to push something through the House. If Trump thought this was possible, he could cave and sign a clean bill to reopen the government. But the president has rejected similar suggestions from Republicans such as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.).\\n\\n3. Congress overrides Trump's veto\\n\\nAnother possibility: Senate Republicans actually endorse one of the clean funding bills the House has already passed. It's unlikely that one of these could get the 60 votes needed to move forward with a final vote, but even if it did, Trump has said he would veto it. But Congress could override that if the bills pass both chambers with two-thirds support. It would be a stretch in the Senate, where 19 Republicans would have to vote with the entire Democratic caucus. McConnell is unlikely to bring up a bill that doesn't have majority GOP backing. But enough Republicans are up for reelection in 2020 in swing-ish states that it could be done, especially because the Senate unanimously passed a clean funding bill before the shutdown.\\n\\n4. A concession from both sides\\n\\nIn the very recent past, Democrats offered Trump some options. In December, they were prepared to give him $2.1 billion for border security, but Trump said he would accept nothing less than $5 billion (now $5.7 billion). After that, Democrats officially gained control of the House and dug in, saying they won't give any money for a wall. Now they're talking about approving Trump's dollar amount for other border security enhancements but stipulating that it can't be used for any kind of physical barrier. But again, Trump has made clear that no wall money means no government reopening.\\n\\n5. A big bargain\\n\\nThe Democrats could revive their deal from last year that would have exchanged $25 billion toward a border wall for a path to citizenship for dreamers. Trump initially signaled interest but was talked out of it by the hard-line anti-immigration people around him. That deal is probably looking pretty good right about now to Trump. It could also appeal to Democrats, who have made protecting dreamers a priority, but committing $25 billion is a huge leap from the $5.7 billion they are refusing now.\\n\\n6. It doesn't end\\n\\nIn this most unlikely of scenarios, neither side folds, and the agencies remain shut down through the end of 2020, when there's a presidential election. If a Democrat wins, he or she could reopen the government. If Trump wins, he wouldn't need to placate his base anymore and might give up on his fight.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}

{"original": "To explain the impeachment inquiry, the GOP has promulgated a flurry of baseless conspiracy theories about the forces arrayed against President Trump. It has been surreal to hear some of the nation's most influential elected officials spouting ideas basically concocted from thin air. The House Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Devin Nunes (Calif.), denounces Ukrainian election meddling in 2016 . . . aimed against the Trump campaign. The Judiciary Committee's Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) claims that if Congress could only talk to a certain three Democratic officials, then every fact of this investigation would be unearthed. Conservatives online hold that former White House aide Fiona Hill was a mole planted by George Soros.\\n\\nOf course, no one purveys these theories with as much verve as Trump. The president has suggested that the nation's first African American president was born abroad (he wasn't), that the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had a part in JFK's assassination (he didn't), that Ukraine rather than Russia was responsible for election interference (it wasn't), that the Mueller investigation empaneled by his own administration was a Democratic plot against him, that the Clintons orchestrated the prison killing of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (who committed suicide, according to an autopsy) and that the Obama administration spied on his campaign, a claim most recently debunked by the Justice Department's inspector general.\\n\\nIt certainly appears, more than ever, that the truth itself is on trial, as Peter Baker recently wrote in the New York Times. Some conservatives say Trump, and Trumpism, represent a new frontier of conspiratorial politics — that the theories are unique to Trump's sensibility and peculiar to his paranoid White House. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication, former president George W. Bush said in a 2017 speech. The main problem behind the proliferation of political conspiracy theories is a president who is also a self-invented fabulist, argued Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson.\\n\\nBut in truth, the stew of alternative facts has been simmering for more than half a century on the right fringe. The GOP had endless opportunities across the decades to banish these theories — about scheming bureaucrats, Jews, the Federal Reserve, the United Nations — and its leaders often saw them as absurd. But they were also useful, helping to rally support from an aggrieved government-hating base. So the party's mandarins allowed them to fester and grow until they spread from the toxic fringe to the mainstream, which they have finally overtaken. It's no wonder someone who embraced those ideas would become successful; Trump validates notions that his voters have long believed, ideas that the party refused to condemn and failed to repudiate.\\n\\nTrump, then, isn't what caused these conspiracy theories. He's what happens when nobody stands in their way.\\n\\nThe intellectual life of the American right since Sen. Joe McCarthy's rise to prominence in 1950 can be seen partially as a series of flirtations with conspiracists and a dedicated reluctance to read fringe crackpots out of its ranks. Yes, William F. Buckley Jr.'s National Review attacked John Birch Society founder Robert Welch, who called Dwight Eisenhower a dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy, in an iconic moment of movement history.\\n\\nBut conservative leaders more typically embraced the passion and support of the Birchers at the grass roots. At its 1964 national convention, the GOP rejected a plank condemning the society, along with its conspiratorial beliefs. Birchers such as John Rousselot and John Schmitz served in Congress as Republicans in good standing, while conservative oilman and family patriarch Fred Koch was a founding member of the society. Birchers took active part in Republican election campaigns and ran right-wing bookstores packed with conspiratorial treatises such as John Stormer's None Dare Call It Treason (about Soviet infiltration of American government) and Fred Schwarz's You Can Trust the Communists (to Be Communists). They served as members of local school boards and state legislatures. Other Republicans rarely spoke up to debunk the Birch view that fluoride in drinking water was part of a communist plot to cause cancer or control Americans' minds.\\n\\nAt times, the wild-eyed conspiracism came from the top. Vice President Spiro Agnew delivered speeches identifying a cabal of Washington- and New York-based power brokers who supposedly controlled the news media, whipping up what journalists at the time considered a frenzy of anti-Semitism on the far right. (In 1976, a few years after he'd been indicted on bribery and other charges, Agnew published a novel pushing the anti-Semitic trope that the media's Zionist lobby was controlling America's foreign policy in the Middle East.)\\n\\nAt other times, understanding that they had to court the conspiracy-minded activists of the base, the party's leaders went out of their way to confer legitimacy on extremists. Take the GOP's relationship with Christian Coalition leader Pat Robertson, who won four states in the 1988 Republican presidential primary contest. In 1991, Robertson published The New World Order, holding that scheming government pooh-bahs were working to set up world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all. He even suggested that President George H.W. Bush was complicit in establishing this new world order. Still, Republicans wanted votes and donations from Robertson's acolytes, so Newt Gingrich, Oliver North, William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jesse Helms and Dinesh D'Souza all happily spoke at his Road to Victory conferences. Sen. Bob Dole, a pillar of the Republican establishment and at the time a presidential candidate, told Robertson's followers in 1995 that I am proud to stand up here and say that I've been awarded a 100 percent voting record in '93 and 100 percent in 1994 and 100 percent in 1995 from the Christian Coalition.\\n\\nDuring the Clinton years, the crackpot theorizing became harder and harder to distinguish from the Republican Party itself. Conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife sent investigators to Arkansas to dig up dirt on the president's past, and when they failed, they settled for salacious fabrications that Bill Clinton was part of a drug-smuggling ring. Scaife became what The Washington Post called a guiding force behind Gingrich's Contract With America and a later generation of tea party activists. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right (his son is a big Trump supporter), started selling a $43 videotape that, among other charges, said Clinton was responsible for the deaths of countless people.\\n\\nOf course, Republican leaders didn't always or uniformly tolerate gonzo conspiracy theories. Presidential nominee John McCain, for instance, contradicted one of his supporters at a 2008 campaign event, telling her that Barack Obama was not, in fact, an Arab. Onetime senator and 1996 presidential hopeful Arlen Specter (Pa.) also stuck up for the truth when he assailed two leading GOP conspiracy theorists, Robertson and Pat Buchanan, as leaders of the intolerant right.\\n\\nYet over the past seven decades, such voices — pro-fact, pro-science and pro-reason — lost the internal debate over how to treat the tinfoil-hat folks. And such moments of truth-telling by Republicans at all levels have been fleeting and rare.\\n\\nHouse Intelligence Committee chair, Adam Schiff (D-CA) looks on as U.S. Representative Devin Nunes (R-CA) speaks as David A. Holmes, Department of State political counselor for the United States Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine and Dr. Fiona Hill, former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia appear before the House Intelligence Committee during an impeachment inquiry hearing at the Longworth House Office Building on Thursday November 21, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\\n\\nWhile the GOP was actively courting allies who propagated conspiracy theories, the Democratic Party took much the opposite tack — mostly rejecting the outlandish left-wing theories that surfaced from time to time. Although some research has found a recent uptick in Democratic support for conspiracy theories (a jump caused by a lack of political power), elected Democrats have typically fenced their party off from wild-eyed claims promulgated on the left. They never embraced the theory that the 9/11 attacks were an inside job carried out by the Bush administration, for example. During the 2004 presidential primary race, even the most lefty antiwar candidates — Dennis Kucinich, Howard Dean, Carol Moseley Braun — largely eschewed conspiracy theories that President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had gone to war for oil or to enrich their friends in the construction business. The left has its share of anti-vaxxers who believe that vaccines cause autism, yet Democratic officials have battled that lie (which Trump himself has promoted).\\n\\nOne reason is that Democrats have been reluctant to use anti-government theories to tear down the things they would prefer to burnish, such as government and international institutions that they believe work for social justice and economic progress. Republicans' conspiracy theories about powerful secret actors are consistent with their small-government views; it is a shorter leap for conservatives to portray Washington as a swamp where individualism, justice and decency go to die.\\n\\nThanks to years of GOP tolerance for surreal thinking on the right, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringe to the center. One poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 63 percent of registered voters subscribe to at least one such theory. Some social science research suggests that people who feel alienated from politics are more prone to thinking conspiratorially. Trump capitalized on that climate of suspicion.\\n\\nIt's easy to see the line from older conspiracy theories to the fact-free claims by Trump supporters today. White House adviser Stephen Miller has drawn anti-immigration rhetoric from white-nationalist publications like the 1973 French novel The Camp of the Saints, which envisions hordes of immigrants obliterating Western civilization. Breitbart News has featured anti-immigrant, anti-gay and anti-black theories that could have been found in an earlier generation of far-right publications, including American Opinion and American Mercury.\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest change of the Trump era is the approach of Republican leaders. In the past, they indulged these theories but never really espoused them. Today, elective officeholders embrace them openly, in the face of explicit counterevidence from the government they purport to run. National security officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that Ukraine did not meddle in the 2016 election and that those who repeat the claim are advancing pro-Russian propaganda. Yet most Republican members of Congress now seem to believe this theory, pointing to a thin report in Politico that documented no top-down, coordinated interference. Trump's racism (calling Mexican immigrants rapists; telling four congresswomen of color who are all U.S. citizens to go back to their crime infested home countries) and anti-Semitism (he implies Jews are loyal primarily to Israel and motivated mostly by money) align well with old allegations that Jewish bankers and assorted globalists have enriched themselves while inflicting economic havoc on the people, as his closing 2016 television ad suggested.\\n\\nPolarization has also made mainstream American culture hospitable to ideas once relegated to the margins. Voters have grown more tolerant of political leaders' failings as long as they adhere to the correct ideological positions, opening a space for someone like Trump to win the presidency and then govern with the support of a minority of the electorate. And grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. For instance, Twitter equips Trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. Fox News also capitalizes on this shift to amplify Trumpian claims (Russia didn't hack our democracy, Fox host Tucker Carlson recently parroted). It's no wonder that, as Gallup found last February, 30 percent of Republicans see Russia in a favorable light. One recent Post survey of attitudes toward 2016 election conspiracy theories found that 26 percent of Americans believed that CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, invented a story of Russian election meddling in order to hide Ukraine's efforts to help Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nUltimately, Trump was the logical consequence of a posture followed for decades at the top echelons of the conservative movement: The batty screeds are silly, but since they help us, we won't work zealously to purge them. Trump's conspiracy-based capture of the GOP has less to do with him and his perspective than with a party that sought and often won the support of people who believe those notions.\\n\\n[CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the year of a Fairleigh Dickinson University poll about conspiracy theories.]"}
{"original": "FEMA's new funding rules were released in an update to the policy guide for the agency. Similar rules are in a House measure that passed late last year and in a pending Senate bill. They are being challenged by church-state advocacy groups that say they violate the First Amendment's prohibition on the government establishing religion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe issue is also pending in federal courts because of lawsuits against FEMA by three Texas churches and two Florida synagogues hit last year by hurricanes that were denied FEMA funding. Lawyers for those houses of worship are waiting to make sure funding comes through, the San Antonio Express-News reported Wednesday.\\n\\nWe thank the Trump administration for righting this longtime wrong and treating disaster-damaged churches, synagogues and other houses of worship fairly — on the same terms as other nonprofits such as museums, community centers and libraries stricken by natural disaster, said Nathan Diament, executive director for public policy at the Orthodox Union, a major U.S. Orthodox Jewish organization.\\n\\nThe debate about FEMA funding doesn't affect a huge number of institutions, since FEMA designation only happens after rare major disasters such as the trio of hurricanes that hit the United States last year — Harvey in Texas, Irma in Florida and Maria in Puerto Rico. For example, Diament said after Harvey four or five synagogues and a few dozen churches sought such aid, while in Florida there was less damage to such spots.\\n\\nHowever, it's a symbolically important issue to some faith groups, particularly in the last decade as religious conservatives have seen their standing challenged by growing liberal and secular forces.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHistorically, Diament said, the issue was bipartisan. It's unclear what will happen going forward if the issue gains public attention, but at the moment a mix of lawmakers is supporting the measure to directly fund houses of worship, including Republican Reps. Christopher H. Smith (N.J.) and Peter T. King (N.Y.) and Democratic Rep. Grace Meng (N.Y.). In the Senate it has backing from Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Roy Blunt, both of Missouri.\\n\\nFaith groups advocating for the change include the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Agudath Israel of America (which represents Orthodox Jews), the Southern Baptist Convention and the Jewish Federations of North America.\\n\\nThe debate about whether FEMA can pay to rebuild churches and other places of worship increased in the early 2000s. Federal disaster assistance had been increasing as the agency grew, prompting debates about who got what. In 2002 the Bush administration changed the practice regarding certain types of funding to religious groups — granting $550,000 to the Seattle Hebrew Academy, a private school devastated by an earthquake.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe issue came to the fore again with Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when religious organizations — not just houses of worship but major nonprofit agencies and institutions — suffered millions in property damage. The Bush administration said it would help rebuild parochial schools, nursing homes and similar religious institutions but would not pay for the rebuilding of houses of worship.\\n\\nI just want to make it clear that any facility that's used primarily for inherently religious activities is not going to be covered, H. James Towey, director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, was quoted as saying in a 2005 article in The Washington Post.\\n\\nPresident George W. Bush established the network of faith-based offices across the federal government to help government work with faith-based nonprofits. President Barack Obama continued them, but Trump has not filled most of the key positions in the network, though he's not formally killed it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome faith groups praised the Bush administration for recognizing the public service faith groups provide and simply not discriminating, while separationist groups said institutions like religious schools were primarily serving a religious purpose and shouldn't get government funds.\\n\\nDiament said while Bush refused to change the policy explicitly, his staff found ways to get many — not all — churches FEMA funds. The rules were applied flexibly he said, with the government focusing on the parts of houses of worship that could be characterized as not exclusively religious — like community halls that serve the homeless, for example.\\n\\nThe federal law behind these various FEMA policies is called the Stafford Act of 1988. Diament said it is silent about the issue of religion altogether. It includes a section about private nonprofits that can get post-disaster funds. It has a list that isn't comprehensive, but more illustrative, Diament said — it just lists the type of groups, and includes community centers, museums and art centers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe issue came up again after Hurricane Sandy, but the Obama administration was less flexible than the Bush White House, Diament said.\\n\\nHouses of worship aren't the only buildings denied FEMA funding by White House policies. The guidelines issued this week use preexisting language, which deems ineligible facilities established or primarily used for political, athletic, recreational, vocational or academic training, conferences.\\n\\nI won't pretend the system of inclusion or exclusion has logic to it, Diament said of the Stafford Act.\\n\\nDena Sher, assistant legislative director for Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said until this week the FEMA guidelines treated religious and nonreligious nonprofits equally, and determined eligibility based on what activities take place. Now this gives houses of worship special treatment, she said."}

{"original": "The academic's answer to the What's Russia thinking? question is invariably We don't know — at least not in the theory-driven, hypothesis-testing, evidence-based way we usually think about knowledge. We do not and cannot know who ordered Whelan's arrest and on what basis. We don't know whether Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved. And we can't calculate exactly what the Kremlin — or the White House, for that matter — will do next.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom: An asset for a spy swap\\n\\nThat, of course, hasn't stopped the punditariat from jumping to what may seem like an obvious conclusion: Russian security picked up Whelan to gain an asset to trade for Maria Butina, a Russian arrested in the United States in July and accused of running clandestine influence operations in Washington without registering as a foreign agent. Indeed, it is very hard to find another explanation in the U.S. media.\\n\\nThe evidence behind this theory is thin, however. Many reporters and pundits are interpreting the Russian government's indignation over the Butina case — including the Foreign Ministry pushing a #FreeMariaButina hashtag and Putin's own statements — to indicate Moscow's intent to retaliate. Others point to history, particularly the 1986 arrest of U.S. journalist Nick Daniloff on spying charges and the quick exchange for Soviet diplomat Gennady Zakharov.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat approach, however, assumes that domestic decision-making is driven by foreign policy imperatives — an assumption that is rarely if ever true. My own approach to Russian foreign policy begins from the argument that in Russia, as in most other countries, domestic factors are in the driver's seat. When we see Whelan's arrest from a Russian vantage point — rather than from the banks of the Potomac — three big questions emerge:\\n\\n1. Why is Moscow being so quiet about the arrest?\\n\\nThe most glaring fact about the Whelan case is how little noise it is making in Russia. Previous espionage cases were instant media circuses. Remember the arrest of U.S. diplomat Ryan Fogle in 2013, caught in the street in a blond wig and carrying a map and compass? Or the trio of British diplomats accused in 2006 of using a fake rock and a network of human rights and media activists to gather intelligence? Or Edmond Pope, the Pennsylvania businessman arrested in 2000 and accused of trying to buy the plans for a hypersonic torpedo?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn all of those cases, agents of the Russian FSB, one of the successors to the Soviet-era KGB, tasked with domestic security and counterintelligence, were followed closely — or in some cases even preceded — by Russian TV cameras, which beamed the purported evidence across the world before the U.S. and British governments could respond.\\n\\nBut not in this case: Whelan hardly made the television news in Russia; we saw no pictures of his arrest or even of the offending flash drive; and what information has leaked out has been mostly through Rosbalt, a marginal if well-connected news website. None of this suggests a well-prepared operation.\\n\\n2. Is a spy swap in keeping with past Russian behavior?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat else do we know? History and official rhetoric suggest that the Kremlin takes reciprocity and parity very seriously, and spy swaps are infrequent. In fact, the only spy swap between Russia and a Western government since the fall of the U.S.S.R. took place in 2010, when Moscow was forced to scrounge up four convicted spies to exchange for 10 sleeper agents, including Anna Chapman, who had been caught in the United States.\\n\\nIn that case, Moscow never denied that the 10 were Russian spies. The people sent West in exchange — all of them Russian citizens, including Sergei Skripal — were convicted of similar offenses at home. But Moscow has steadfastly denied the charges against Butina, who in any case did not go on trial for espionage. A Whelan-for-Butina swap, then, would be heavily out of whack, and thus out of keeping with Russian diplomatic practice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n3. Or are Russian security services settling domestic scores?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat we seem to be seeing is a much more haphazard process than the conventional wisdom would suggest. Rather than an order coming from Putin's own office to arrest and make an example of an American citizen before organizing a swap for Butina, most of the domestic evidence points to a political machine caught off guard by events on the ground.\\n\\nIf the Kremlin itself didn't order Whelan's arrest, what's the alternative explanation? One other thing we know is that all is not well in the world of Russia's secret services. The various branches — the FSB counterintelligence agency, the SVR foreign intelligence service and the GRU military intelligence agency, most prominently — have always competed for prestige, turf and money.\\n\\nFaced with tightening budgets, Russia's security agencies and even ambitious individual officers have evidently climbed over one another to prove their value, with the GRU taking center stage in 2018 — albeit with decidedly mixed results. It was the GRU, after all, that was responsible for the Novichok nerve agent attack on Skripal in Salisbury, England, and for a string of spy scandals in Switzerland, Austria and the Netherlands.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt would thus be far from surprising if there were also FSB agents looking to demonstrate their own worth by, say, arresting an American spy within a stone's throw of the Kremlin. That last bit, of course, is speculation. And that's the point: All of this is speculation. Spy stories always are."}
{"original": "But Metro isn't the first transit agency to institute such a policy, or offer some other kind of formal mea culpa when its trains fail to run on time.\\n\\nOther agencies' policies range from the modest (apology notes and middle-school-style late passes) to the extremely generous. And those policies have garnered mix results.\\n\\nCheck out how other transit systems have executed their own passenger refund programs:\\n\\nIn London, riders demand their 'pound' of flesh\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTransport for London, the agency that runs the city's subway system, has a policy similar to the one that Metro officials are seeking to adopt.\\n\\nAccording to their guidelines, refunds are issued for trips that take at least 15 minutes longer than they should have, and passengers must apply for a refund within 28 days of the subpar commute. The exceptions are even more sweeping than those proposed by Metro: Riders are not eligible for a refund if the delay in question was caused by a strike, a security issue, weather, scheduled repair work, or medical emergencies.\\n\\nAnd yet, even with those wide-ranging exceptions, Transport for London still doles out a significant amount of money each month in passenger reimbursements. From September 2016 to August 2017, the transit agency reimbursed riders for a total of 135,011 delayed trips. That amounts to 503,920 pounds — about $680,972 — in refunded fare revenue.\\n\\nThe refunds are automatically added to riders' Oyster cards, the name of the fare passes that riders use for the London subway and other British transit systems — which have followed Transport for London's lead and offered refunds when trains are significantly delayed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd still, people aren't always happy with the restitution.\\n\\nAnd, as British commuters demonstrate, just because riders are receiving fare reimbursements doesn't mean they will cease to complain about late trains.\\n\\nIn Boston, even golden retrievers (used to) get refunds\\n\\nYears ago, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority in Boston had its own delay reimbursement program, refunding fares when trains were more than 30 minutes late. The program was canceled in 2011.\\n\\nAt the time, the MBTA's general manager, Richard Davey, estimated that the system would save $1 million annually by nixing refunds.\\n\\nWhile some customers may be disappointed with the program's elimination, it's important that people know that this money will be put to very good use, said Davey (who, incidentally, is now a consultant who performs work for Metro). By reallocating these funds into the development of more customer service enhancements, we expect a greater number of T riders to benefit from this money.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the refunds weren't just costly — they were ripe with opportunity for abuse.\\n\\nThat became clear in 2006, when a Boston Herald investigation revealed that the MBTA, known locally as the T, was consistently handing out cash for fraudulent claims. Staff hardly ever bothered to check records to determine whether trains were actually delayed at the times listed in refund requests.\\n\\nFrom a recap in the Boston Herald:\\n\\nA Herald review of fraud cases last year found grifters were submitting heaps of phony claims on behalf of relatives, unwitting friends and even the dead. A Whitman family was caught submitting requests in the name of its golden retriever Max. … Under its customer bill of rights, the T grants refunds to riders if service is 30 minutes late. But officials said money was being returned without efforts to verify if trains or buses were actually behind schedule. In 2005, the T granted every request it received.\\n\\nThe Herald's investigation prompted the T's transit police agency to conduct a year-long crackdown. That year, the T received 68,500 filed claims — less than half from the year before. And of those filed claims, 30 percent were debunked and denied. From the Herald:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNew statistics on refunds paid through the T's on-time performance guarantee program show the cash-strapped authority was being bilked regularly, with some checks going to people claiming to be on two trains at once. The backroom business of people trying to cheat the system was even more rampant than we thought, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Agency General Manager Daniel Grabauskas said. It's taken a lot of extra work on our part to get control of it. … During the investigation, Transit police forced several charlatans to pay thousands of dollars in restitution and prosecuted one woman who initially refused to return the money. The T has since changed refund forms to require more information from riders and has inserted new language warning fraud will be prosecuted.\\n\\nThis, too, was part of the reason the T canceled the program.\\n\\nThere were many fraudulent claims, MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo told the Boston Globe in 2015. The process of verifying the claims was a costly and time-consuming strain on our limited resources.\\n\\nIn Tokyo, it's never too early to say 'sorry'\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's one thing to offer refunds to significantly delayed passengers. It's another thing to run a service that's so punctual that such a reimbursement system would be absurd.\\n\\nSuch is the state of the subway in Tokyo, where delays are measured not in minutes, but in seconds. And in the rare instances that trains are (slightly) tardy, administrators of Tokyo's transit systems deliver profuse apologies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Tokyo's Metropolitan Intercity Railway Company garnered international attention last year when a train operator mistakenly departed the station 20 seconds early. The company issued a statement, saying that workers had failed to double-check the exact scheduled time of departure, 9:44:40 a.m., before pulling out of the station at 9:44:20 a.m. (Still, they pointed out in the statement, there was no evidence that anyone had actually been left behind on the platform.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's the kind of problem that most American transit agencies would love to have.\\n\\nJack Evans, chairman of the Metro board, said this week that the Japanese adherence to punctuality is the kind of service for which Metro should be aiming. Evans said Metro's proposed fare refund program is in keeping with the spirit of the Japanese ethos, if not the execution.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think this is a step toward saying we're serious, Evans said. Contrast that, however, with my trip to Tokyo, where the on-time rate is 99 percent, and when you're not, the conductor comes down and apologizes to everybody on the train.\\n\\nThat's the goal, Evans said, and we're 15 minutes out.\\n\\nFaiz Siddiqui contributed to this report."}

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders added that we have started returning United States troops home.\\n\\nOn Dec. 23 — after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest of Trump's withdrawal decision — Trump tweeted that he had discussed what he called a slow and coordinated [U.S.] pullout from Syria with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring a Christmas visit to troops in Iraq, Trump said that he would deny any request from the military to extend the mission in Syria. They said again, recently, 'Can we have more time?'  Trump said of U.S. generals. I said: 'Nope. You can't have any more time. You've had enough time.' We've knocked them out, he said of the Islamic State. We've knocked them silly.\\n\\nPompeo is also headed to the region this week to reassure Arab allies that the United States will not abandon them to either the Islamic State or to Iran. Reports that the Americans were leaving, said a senior administration official who briefed reporters Friday on Pompeo's trip, were false news and there was no Syria departure timeline.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPlans and assurances offered by Bolton in Israel were additional confirmation that withdrawal plans are on hold until conditions on the ground match the president's stated assessment of the situation in Syria.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Bolton said that the defense of Israel and other friends in the region is absolutely assured, that the Kurds and others would be protected, and that the administration would make sure ISIS is defeated and is not able to revive itself and become a threat again.\\n\\nWhile Bolton's reassurances may have come as a relief to some, a top House Democrat stressed that the priorities the national security adviser outlined were obvious — and simply highlighted how dangerous Trump's initial withdrawal announcement was.\\n\\nWe don't want ISIS to rise again and be a transnational terrorist threat, and we don't want our allies the Kurds to be slaughtered by Erdogan in Turkey. That was obvious, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said Sunday on ABC News's This Week.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm pleased that John Bolton has recognized the national security interest, and that's what we want to have, Smith said,  . . . not a tweet going 'Eh, let's get out of Syria.'\\n\\nSmith said he hoped to have Mattis testify before his panel, calling the former defense secretary's views invaluable.\\n\\nIn his resignation letter, Mattis noted disagreements he'd had with Trump over the president's approach to U.S. allies and adversaries and stated that Trump deserved a defense secretary whose views would be more aligned with his. Smith was more succinct in his assessment of Trump's approach to global relations, saying Sunday that our allies matter enormously and the president treats them like dirt.\\n\\nRepublicans, too, have worried about whether the president is listening to his advisers, warning him that the administration's actions in Syria will affect the United States' reputation globally. At the time of Trump's announcement, some wondered openly whether he was unduly influenced by foreign leaders such as Erdogan, whose agenda in the region is somewhat different from that of the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAsked Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation whether Bolton's comments were an admission that Trump had made a mistake, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said, I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out . . . He has a goal of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.\\n\\nThere are three things we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal, Graham said. We want to make sure that, when we leave, the Kurds do not get slaughtered . . . We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated, and Iran is not the biggest winner.\\n\\nTrump, he said, is slowing down and he's reevaluating his policies in light of those three objectives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSimilar questions arose last week, after Trump offered a perplexing take on world history, incorrectly claiming that the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan was to combat terrorists infiltrating into Soviet territory, and that the invasion — and the 10-year war that followed — were the cause of the Soviet Union's 1991 collapse.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhite House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney distanced himself from those comments Sunday, defending the advice that he and others give Trump.\\n\\nThe fact that he makes a decision that might be different than his advisers doesn't mean that he's getting bad information, Mulvaney told CNN. It means he's relying on information other than what his advisers are giving him."}
{"original": "Among the changes sought by the Department of Housing and Urban Development: redefining what it means to promote fair housing, eliminating the assessment used to address barriers to racial integration, and encouraging cities to remove regulations that stand in the way of affordable housing, according to the proposed rule obtained by The Washington Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFair housing advocates say the proposal reduces the financial pressure on local governments to end residential segregation, as required by the 1968 Fair Housing Act, and is the latest erosion of Obama-era regulations designed to enforce the landmark legislation.\\n\\nThe 2015 regulations required communities to take meaningful action against long-standing segregation by analyzing housing patterns, concentrated poverty and disparities in access to transportation, jobs and good schools.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHUD Secretary Ben Carson has characterized those steps as overly burdensome and too prescriptive, saying that transforming segregated living patterns and poor neighborhoods into areas of opportunity is often not within a community's control.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe proposed rules focus on increasing what the administration is calling fair housing choice — through greater housing supply along with safe and sanitary housing conditions that HUD says will better allow families to live where they want — rather than racially integrating communities.\\n\\nThe proposed rule entirely ignores the essential racial desegregation obligations of fair housing law, said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\\n\\nThomas Silverstein, a fair housing attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that discrimination and segregation will continue unabated when HUD doesn't provide meaningful fair housing oversight of local governments.\\n\\nHUD officials declined to comment on Friday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe housing agency also wants to rank communities based on housing costs and fair market rents, and give top performers priority for federal housing grants.\\n\\nThe administration says such incentives would bolster the availability of affordable housing. But Silverstein said it would punish high-cost coastal cities with great housing needs — areas that are less supportive of Trump — and reward smaller, cheaper ones.\\n\\nThe proposed rules, to be published in the Federal Register ahead of a 60-day public comment period, come two years after Carson suspended the 2015 rule requiring more than 1,200 communities receiving federal housing dollars to draft plans to desegregate their communities — or risk losing billions in federal funds.\\n\\nFair housing advocates unsuccessfully sued HUD in 2018 over what they characterized as its failure to enforce fair housing laws.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHUD subsequently withdrew a computer assessment tool that provided communities with data and maps to help them gauge neighborhood segregation.\\n\\nHousing advocates said the proposed new rule represents a dangerous and fundamental misunderstanding of fair housing issues. The provision known as Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing was put in place five decades ago to prompt communities and public housing authorities that receive federal funds to address the harmful effects of their historical actions, said Lisa Rice, president and chief executive of the National Fair Housing Alliance.\\n\\nThose lingering effects are still with us today, Rice said. There is an inextricable link between race, place and opportunity. The fact is that communities of color disproportionately do not have banks, do not have grocery stores, do not have basic infrastructure or equal access to municipal services and amenities like sewer lines and paved roads.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe proposed rule also limits enforcement by only toughening federal scrutiny of communities sued by the federal government — and not private entities including civil rights and fair housing organizations, Rice said. That means jurisdictions found liable for discrimination through private lawsuits would still be eligible to receive federal funding, she said.\\n\\nSecretary Carson is scrapping years of extensive input and intensive work that went into the fair housing rule and essentially reverting to the agency's previous flawed and failed system, Yentel said. In doing so, Secretary Carson continues his pattern of attempts to weaken and disrupt the agency's responsibility to uphold its fair housing duties.\\n\\nCarson has long criticized federal efforts to desegregate American neighborhoods as failed socialist experiments. When questioned about the agency's intention regarding the fair housing provision during congressional hearings last spring, Carson testified that it costs a lot of money and man hours to do that analysis. He signaled that he intended to focus on building affordable housing across all communities by deregulating and easing zoning restrictions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhy do you have segregation in housing? Not because George Wallace is blocking the door. It's because people can only afford to live in certain places, Carson said at a House hearing in May.\\n\\nSome libertarian economists characterized the previous rule requiring communities to document segregation patterns and barriers to fair housing as an exercise in bureaucratic symbolism and praised the Trump administration for getting rid of the tedious reporting requirements."}
{"original": "That is some screwed-up stuff. So the Erik Wemple Blog asked the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) for its take on the situation, and this statement came forth from President Margaret Talev: It is longstanding practice for reporters to ask questions of the president during events like the one today, and it is at the president's discretion to decide whether and how to answer those questions. It is up to news organizations to determine which journalists they assign to represent them in the pool.\\n\\nThe statement made the point that journalists decide who covers the president, and how they do so. Though it was a touch diplomatic for some:\\n\\nIn an interview last week, Talev spoke about the role of the WHCA in such matters. I think everybody was certainly alarmed when they first heard that, said Talev, senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg, but our job is to find out what's going on before we react and we wanted to get a real sense of whether there was actually a threat to restrict access. According to Talev, Sanders gave assurances that there would be no such restriction.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n[We] have spoken and continue to speak out on our right to freely ask questions of the president, but there haven't been any steps to restrict that. I think that if there had been, you would have seen a much different reaction, said Talev, who didn't take issue with Acosta's version of events.\\n\\nStephen Miller, President Trump's senior policy adviser, got into a tense exchange on Aug. 2 with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about immigration. (Reuters)\\n\\nSuch are the nuts-and-bolts issues that the WHCA has been tackling for decades. The association launched in 1914 amid squabbles with President Woodrow Wilson over his news-conference policy. Certain evening newspapers, griped the president, were publishing quotes that he'd deemed off the record. More than a century of fighting for access to all manner of presidential events — bill signings, fundraisers and so on — ensued.\\n\\nAnd then came President Trump, along with press secretary Sean Spicer. On his first day in the briefing room, Spicer lambasted the assembled media for allegedly misreporting inauguration crowds — an attack based on well-exposed falsehoods — and then left the lectern without taking questions. In one appearance, Spicer combined access problems with something new: an official White House policy of media hostility on a level with no parallel in modern memory.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll year long the WHCA has labored to handle the double threat. As the president has harangued about fake news and otherwise riffed about de-licensing media organizations, the WHCA found working-level problems — like the decision, under Spicer's time as press secretary, to ban cameras from a series of press briefings. The WHCA's position on this issue is clear: we believe strongly that Americans should be able to watch and listen to senior government officials face questions from an independent news media, in keeping with the principles of the First Amendment and the need for transparency at the highest levels of government, noted then-WHCA President Jeff Mason in a June statement.\\n\\nSince then, Spicer has left the White House; Sanders has succeeded him, tamping down the tension in the room; and access problems have eased. The president's hostility toward the media has not:\\n\\nSo how does the WHCA break it all down? Here's a list of pluses and minuses that Talev included in her New Year's memo, which was circulated Tuesday evening.\\n\\nAfter the Erik Wemple Blog tweeted that inventory, dissenters converged.\\n\\nThere is indeed a problem of tonality here. Areas for improvement is a term commonly used in educational or employment settings, in which the person being evaluated presumably has the will to make adjustments. Such is not the situation here: Trump publicly denigrates the media as a matter of core political strategy. The harmful and baseless slams on the Fourth Estate started early in his presidential campaign and haven't abated.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn her interview with this blog, Talev was careful to note that the WHCA isn't happy with the White House, even though some of the access problems of the Spicer months have gone away. The ongoing public undercutting and assault of the free press is really problematic, she said. It's troubling to me as a journalist and troubling to me as an American, but it's something we have to do our jobs in the face of for now. … It's very troubling to have the most powerful figure in the U.S. or in the world telling people that they can't trust facts. Nothing works if you can't trust facts. Society doesn't work if you can't trust facts."}
{"original": "Kosovo President Hashim Thaci made a previously unreported diplomatic trip to Berlin last month, where he met with U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell, a Trump confidant. Thaci pledged then that he would reverse course on punitive tariffs imposed on all Serb goods.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn an exchange with The Washington Post on Friday, conducted in English over email, Thaci said he is ready to consider lifting the tariffs if a clear way to proceed towards reaching a Final Peace Agreement with Serbia is opened for Kosovo.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe tariffs imposed last month — a move that has infuriated Serbia and Russia and alarmed the European Union — were accompanied by threats from Kosovo to raise a standing army over apparent violation of its agreement with NATO, which maintains a small defense force in Kosovo a decade after its separation from Serbia and formation as a sovereign country.\\n\\nSerbia has never recognized Kosovo's independence and has warned of an armed intervention over the latest disagreements. Russia considers the vital role that the United States played in creating the country to be illegitimate meddling at its doorstep.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYes, tariffs are an exceptional measure, Thaci said. The willingness from our side to do away with it is there. It becomes a stronger resolve if we feel support and guidance from our partners in this. For my part, I will reassure the Kosovo people that guidance and support is totally there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThaci's view, which has not been previously reported, comes at some political peril as nationalist tensions spike. He cannot reverse the tariffs on his own and he faces internal opposition from Kosovo's prime minister, his sometimes political rival. But the United States considers his overture a first step toward stopping a tit-for-tat escalation over the past two months and a potential return to what had appeared to be the most fruitful efforts in a decade toward a final peace accord.\\n\\nKosovo's friends and I share a clear and vivid understanding of the enormous challenge we have in front of us in terms of doing what we are called to do by our conscience, and by our historical duty — to make peace possible and viable, Thaci said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump sent personal letters to the leaders of both countries last month, urging them to return to peace talks and offering the possibility of a joint White House invitation. Although the White House has not widely discussed the outreach, Thaci and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic published their copies online.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFailure to capi­tal­ize on this unique opportunity would be a tragic setback, as another chance for a comprehensive peace is unlikely to occur again soon, Trump wrote to the Kosovar leader.\\n\\nWe stand ready to assist your efforts to reach an agreement that balances the interests of both Kosovo and Serbia. Such an agreement is within reach. I look forward to hosting you and President Aleksandar Vucic at the White House to celebrate what would be an historic accord, the letter to Thaci read.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBoth leaders said they took the letters as a sign that Trump is willing to take a more active role as mediator, although U.S. officials said they maintain a hands-off approach.\\n\\nFor resolving a complex and difficult issue like the generations- [and] even centuries-long conflict like this, strong leadership is needed, Vucic said in an interview. The participation of great powers with influence in the region is a must. As the leader of one of world's great nations, one with deep involvement in the region, I am sure President Trump could make an important contribution to resolving this conflict.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVucic expressed skepticism that Thaci is sincere about reversing tariffs and said Thaci and his prime minister are playing a self-serving game of good cop, bad cop.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTry to put yourselves into our shoes, Vucic said. What would you want if you were in our place? We want the best relations possible, reliable partnership and also some breathing space, so we can look after our own interests. In return, we offer genuine and reliable support for peace and development of this part of Europe, and mutual respect.\\n\\nGrenell urged normalization of the Kosovo-Serb relationship and direct negotiations between the two countries when he met with Thaci, U.S. officials said. He also raised concerns about gay rights in Kosovo, including light prosecution of violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, U.S. officials said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe has not met individually with Vucic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGrenell was a spokesman and adviser for now-White House national security adviser John Bolton and other U.S. ambassadors at the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration. He was a conservative foreign policy commentator before taking up his post in Berlin last year. Thaci said he has a close relationship with the U.S. ambassador in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, but approached Grenell separately as Trump's go-to person in Europe. He traveled to Berlin with three aides on Dec. 21, a few days after he received Trump's letter.\\n\\nPresident Thaci and I spoke about the importance of making long-term decisions instead of reacting in the short term. I was pleased that he agreed and committed to work to end the tariffs that were recently imposed on Serbian products, Grenell said in a statement to The Post. This move would help send the right signals that he is serious about negotiating and help build trust between the parties.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThaci called Trump's communication groundbreaking and said U.S. support for Kosovo is vital to its future. Kosovo's 2008 birth was a passion project for many conservative advisers to Bush, a few of whom now work for Trump, but Trump himself had not previously indicated detailed views on the Balkan conflicts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBolton said in August that the United States would not oppose mutually agreed land swaps then being floated by Serbia and Kosovo as a way to reach a final accord. That put the Trump administration at odds with Germany and numerous other E.U. nations that fear any realignment of borders could reopen conflicts that ripped the Balkans apart in the 1990s.\\n\\nBut talk of a grand bargain between Kosovo and Serbia fizzled last fall, and each nation hardened its positions.\\n\\nKosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, writing in The Washington Post on Nov. 28, defended the 100 percent tariffs on Serbian goods as a defensive action in the name of fair trade, national security and our vital national interests.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump sidestepped the issue of land swaps in his letter, but his language suggests he would accept a redrawn border if both sides agreed to it.\\n\\nPresident Trump's letter made many things clear in a situation that until recently was marked by a growing sense of confusion and uneasiness because of a whole array of contradicting positions, statements, and ideas in relation to Kosovo and Serbia, Thaci said.\\n\\nHe urged bilateral talks with the U.S. in a leading role in coordinating international input for the final Peace Agreement that will bring recognition of Kosovo by Serbia.\\n\\nDaniel Vajdich, a former senior adviser for Europe and Eurasia on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, welcomed Trump's intervention.\\n\\nThere is real potential right now to solve one of Europe's last remaining territorial disputes, said Vajdich, president of strategic advisory firm Yorktown Solutions and a fellow at the Atlantic Council.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe U.S. strategic interest is to settle a dispute that Russia uses to blackmail Serbia into submission and keep the Balkans perpetually destabilized, Vajdich said. Solving the Kosovo question would virtually eliminate Russia's leverage over Serbia and its influence in the Balkans. Achieving this should be one of the U.S.'s core interests in Europe."}
{"original": "For starters, a number of Republicans have joined Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in denouncing the attempted coup. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), in a written statement, declared that after two months of recounts and legal challenges, not a single state recount changed a result and, of the dozens of lawsuits filed, not one found evidence of fraud or irregularities widespread enough to change the result of the election. Portman, therefore, concluded: Over the course of my public service career, I have taken the same oath on numerous occasions, swearing to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. I plan on honoring that oath by supporting the state certifications and the will of the people. I will vote to certify in accordance with my duty under the Constitution. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of the Senate's most conservative members, will also decline to join the mob.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Georgia, we got an earful from Republican officials outraged by President Trump's attempt to strong-arm Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's secretary of state, into changing vote totals there. Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official who previously denounced attempts to change the state's results and threats made against public officials, spoke on behalf of sane Americans. I wanted to scream, he said of Trump's call with Raffensperger, during a news conference on Monday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are people in positions of authority and respect who have said their votes didn't count, and it's not true, Sterling declared. It's Whac-A-Mole again. It is Groundhog Day again. I'm going to talk about the things I've talked about repeatedly for two months, but I'm going to do it for one last time, he said.\\n\\nThe U.S. is more politically polarized than ever. The Post's Kate Woodsome asks experts what drives political sectarianism — and what we can do about it. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nSterling provided a thorough debunking of the conspiracy theories Trump and his lackeys are pushing. The bottom line, he reiterated: This is all easily, provably false. And yet the president persists. As do his Dirty Dozen co-conspirators.\\n\\nRaffensperger also denounced the attempt to force him to fabricate the results. He told CBS News: We get complaints all the time. We investigate those. But we looked at their data. Their data is not correct. And we can go down that line point by point and show what our data shows. Raffensperger also revealed that he was not planning to release the tape of the call with Trump, but then Trump lied about it on Twitter. Once again, Trump is his own worst enemy. In any event, Raffensperger said, I know what we're going to do. We're going to follow the law. We're going to follow the process.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, big business came down on the side of elections matter. The Business Roundtable, made up executives from the country's largest companies, put out a statement: There is no authority for Congress to reject or overturn electoral votes lawfully certified by the states and affirmed by the Electoral College. . . . Business Roundtable opposes efforts to delay or overturn the clear outcome of the election. A similar letter was signed by a group of 200 executives, who wrote: This presidential election has been decided and it is time for the country to move forward. . . . Attempts to thwart or delay this process run counter to the essential tenets of our democracy. Now, these business leaders need to remember the politicians who sought to overthrow our democracy when they start handing out campaign donations.\\n\\nHawley and Cruz, both likely harboring presidential ambitions, blew it. They apparently figured they would raise a fuss, and that the others would go along. Did they not anticipate that some of their colleagues would rediscover their oaths of office — or at least be bright enough to surmise that sedition could block the path to higher office? There is something fitting that two supremely ambitious men may have doomed their own quest for the presidency through an act of unbridled cynicism and contempt for democracy.\\n\\nIn any event, perhaps we have reached the best point for the Republican Party to divide in two. On one side are supporters of an authoritarian putsch. On the other is everyone else. The latter have plenty to do to come up with rational policy ideas, but at least they are not traitors to democracy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}

{"original": "Regardless of the final outcome in Georgia, Biden will not have a free hand by any means, given the country's and Congress's divisions. One more sign of the turbulence surrounding his future presidency will play out as a joint session of Congress begins the process of counting the electoral college votes, with Republicans poised to raise multiple objections.\\n\\nBut on a day that will ultimately seal Biden's electoral college victory, Georgia voters have given the president-elect one big present and the possibility of a second — something few Democrats thought possible a few months ago.\\n\\nBiden and the Democrats can thank Trump in part for what is happening in Georgia. The president, in denial over his election defeat, did everything imaginable to cloud and disrupt the Senate runoffs with his repeated claims that the state, along with several others, had been stolen from him in November.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe final days of the runoff campaign were all about Trump. On Saturday, he badgered Brad Raffensperger, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, in a phone call, pressing him to find enough votes to declare Trump the winner of the November election. His Monday night rally in Dalton was a textbook case of a president wallowing in conspiracy theories, baseless charges and long-refuted arguments.\\n\\nHow much all of that affected the outcome in the runoffs is anyone's guess, but few Republicans thought he was anything but harmful. Trump's insistence that the results of presidential election be reversed, his call for Republicans to raise objections to the electoral college votes during Wednesday's joint session of Congress and his pressure campaign against Vice President Pence to do what is not possible have split his party at the worst possible moment. That might have influenced enough Republican voters in Georgia to stay home, helping Democrats' cause.\\n\\nBiden, meanwhile, took a different course as he approached the Georgia races. In his final appearance on Monday, he focused on the differences that Democratic control of the Senate would make for the voters — beginning with $2,000 covid relief payments, which were blocked in the Republican-controlled Senate. He never mentioned Trump's phone call to Raffensperger.\\n\\nThe Georgia runoff campaigns were the most closely watched and consequential Senate contests anyone could remember. The two races drew brigades of organizers, who flooded the state trying to turn out every possible voter. Much credit goes to the multiple efforts to mobilize Black voters, led by Stacey Abrams, LaTosha Brown of Black Voters Matter, and others.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHundreds of millions of dollars were spent in a matter of weeks, much of the money used for television ads that rained almost nonstop on the voters. Around the world, people were focused on Georgia — and on Trump.\\n\\nThe two Senate contests presented Georgia voters with an elemental choice: whether to continue with a divided government, as Americans have often preferred, or to seal the rejection of Trump after a single term and give the Democrats the narrowest of advantages in the coming legislative maneuvering.\\n\\nBut there was another choice — Biden and the Democrats or Trump and the Republicans — for this was a tribal election in a nation of political tribes. The four candidates — Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Republicans David Perdue, whose term expired Sunday, and Kelly Loeffler, who was appointed to the Senate a year ago — fought their individual races but were merely players in a much larger battle over the direction of the country in the post-Trump era.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarnock has been declared the winner over Loeffler, while Ossoff holds a narrow lead over Perdue.\\n\\nEven if Democrats end up with control of both houses of Congress, little will come easily for Biden. The country remains deeply divided, and the party divisions in Congress reflect the nation as a whole. Trump will be out of office, but he will not necessarily be out of sight — still able to make noise and create disruptions. Republicans could snap back from fighting among themselves to unite in ideological opposition to Biden's agenda, as they did when he was vice president during Barack Obama's presidency.\\n\\nThe Democrats' margin in the House is the smallest the party has had in more than a century, and it will require every bit of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's political savvy — and muscle — to keep her caucus united behind Biden's agenda. A Senate that relies on a vice president to break ties offers no margin for error and probably calls for considerable compromise.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAhead of the vote-counting in Georgia, Biden advisers had said that the results, whichever way they went, would not fundamentally change his approach as president. They said that he would seek the broadest possible consensus for his agenda and that he remains committed to his pledge to try to work constructively with Republicans in Congress, wherever possible.\\n\\nStill, no Democrat underestimates the difference for Biden between Democrats having the gavel and not having the gavel in the Senate. In a variety of practical ways, control gives Democrats levers of power that will ease his ability to govern.\\n\\nOf immediate importance, Democratic control would affect the process of confirming Biden's Cabinet nominees. With Democrats in charge, hearings and votes could move ahead more swiftly, with the prospect of having nominees for the State and Defense departments and perhaps a few other key positions ready by Inauguration Day. If Republicans remained in control, confirmation delays would be inevitable and potentially costly, and some of Biden's nominees would struggle to be confirmed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the longer term, Democratic control of the Senate would have a major effect on judicial nominations, as Republicans, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), have demonstrated during both the Obama and Trump presidencies.\\n\\nAnother difference is what a Senate in Republican hands rather than Democratic hands would mean for investigations and oversight hearings. A Republican Senate could put Biden and the Democrats on the defensive, pursuing Trump-inspired investigations.\\n\\nThe most significant procedural advantage for Biden with Democrats in control would be the ability to use the process known as reconciliation to move some parts of his agenda. Because Biden does not favor ending the filibuster, he would still need 60 votes to enact major policy changes. Through reconciliation, a simple Democratic majority could do considerable business on spending and tax issues.\\n\\nThese concrete implications of Democratic control of the Senate, although important, still do not fully encompass the significance of what is taking place in Georgia.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite Trump's defeat in November, many Republicans took solace in the fact that their down-ballot candidates in key House and Senate races did better than the president. In Georgia, Perdue came within three-tenths of a percentage point of winning outright. Loeffler was in a multicandidate field and so was always destined to be in a runoff.\\n\\nThe Republicans entered the runoff elections narrowly favored to win for several reasons: Both were incumbents; Georgia, while a changing state, still seemed more center-right in its posture; and Republicans have generally been more effective at turning out their voters in runoff contests. Democrats were dubious-to-pessimistic at the start of the runoff campaigns.\\n\\nThen Trump intervened. For two months, he insisted that the presidential election in Georgia — among other states — was rigged, stolen, subject to irregularities, fraudulent and on and on. Exit polls Tuesday showed that three-quarters of Republican voters said the November election was not fair, while 9 in 10 Democrats said it was fair.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "Travelers easily could adapt in the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, when the illness was mostly contained to a province in China. Then cases started turning up — and spreading — in other countries.\\n\\nConcerns about widespread illness in such places as Italy have brought anxieties closer to American travelers. Late Friday, the U.S. State Department raised its advisory level to warn Americans to reconsider travel to all of Italy because of sustained community spread of the virus and warned against traveling in the Lombardy and Veneto regions. More than 1,600 people have tested positive there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also elevated its language about the country, issuing a warning to avoid all nonessential travel.\\n\\nI wouldn't have predicted a week ago that Northern Italy would be a place you wouldn't want to travel to right now, Robert Quigley, regional medical director for travel risk mitigation company International SOS, said Thursday before the advisories were raised. You can't predict where there's going to be the next hit.\\n\\nLate last week, authorities confirmed cases in the United States with no known origin, marking a new chapter for the spread in the country.\\n\\nAs each day brings news of more cases, what is a potential traveler to do? Is it time to cancel a trip? Should people move forward with their already-scheduled vacations? And for those still set on traveling, what's the best way to plan?\\n\\n[Coronavirus live updates]\\n\\nIf you decide to cancel\\n\\nStaying put is not an uncommon practice of late. Major corporations called off large gatherings, and hotel chains reported rising cancellations. Some travel agents report that clients are canceling cruise plans abroad and changing to U.S.-based sailings or all-inclusive resorts. Airlines including American, JetBlue and Alaska waived change and cancellation fees for new bookings in case customers get nervous about traveling.\\n\\nExperts say there are resources potential travelers should consider when deciding whether to call off a trip, including advice and situation reports from the World Health Organization, advisories from the State Department — which often contain detailed information about specific regions within a country — and notices from the CDC. As of Monday, the health agency warned Americans to avoid nonessential travel to China, Iran, South Korea and Italy and to enhance precautions in Japan because of the coronavirus.\\n\\n\\n\\nFew people are seen March 2 in Rome's Piazza Navona, which would usually be full of tourists. Italy's tourism industry has been affected by a coronavirus outbreak, with hotels reporting mass cancellations even in cities with few or no cases of the virus. (Remo Casilli/Reuters)\\n\\nI think right now what we're seeing is there is more transmission in certain parts of the world, and so it's important to keep an eye on where the transmission is being reported, said Crystal Watson, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Right now those places might not be the best places to go if you can avoid traveling there. But I think soon we're going to see a lot more transmission around the world.\\n\\n[These airlines are offering flexible travel options to adapt to the spread of coronavirus]\\n\\nThose deciding what to do, Watson said, should consider whether they are at a higher risk for severe illness if they are infected. That includes people 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions.\\n\\nIsaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases physician and scientist based at the University of Toronto, said that although patterns so far show most people infected with the coronavirus will have mild symptoms, there are still many questions.\\n\\nI think we still have to remain humble that we don't have the answers yet, he said. Because of that and because we don't have a vaccine and because we don't know a lot about this virus, people may have some fear wherever there are unknowns.\\n\\nSquaremouth, the travel insurance comparison website, noted a very large spike in calls from customers last week after the virus spread to Italy. According to a survey the company provides after people buy insurance, 27 percent said they made the purchase because of the coronavirus.\\n\\nRight now we are primarily hearing from customers who want to cancel their trip because they are worried about how the virus is going to spread, just general feelings of fear and uncertainty, said Squaremouth spokeswoman Kasara Barto. Or they are still planning on traveling, but they want to be able to purchase a policy that lets them cancel in case the outbreak spreads.\\n\\n[Companies are canceling U.S. domestic travel over coronavirus fears]\\n\\nMost who have booked and want to cancel because they're scared to travel — or because their original reason for traveling might no longer be valid — are out of luck, unless they bought a comprehensive policy that allows them to call off their trip for any reason.\\n\\nBarto recommends calling hotels, airlines and cruise lines to find out if they can waive rebooking fees, change trip dates or otherwise offer flexibility. Those who booked a trip with a travel agent should ask whether that person — who may have ongoing relationships with travel companies — can help make changes without a penalty, Becky Powell, president of Protravel International, said in an email.\\n\\nLaurel Brunvoll, owner of Unforgettable Trips travel agency, recommends taking a wait-and-see approach to cancellation to watch how the situation plays out.\\n\\nFor areas with a heightened risk, it may all depend upon when someone is planning to travel there, she said in an email.\\n\\nIf you go ahead with a trip\\n\\nMaybe it would be too costly to cancel. Maybe travelers just don't want to reschedule, they're not in a high-risk group and the destination isn't under an advisory. Whatever the reason, the trip is still on the table.\\n\\nExperts say the key before heading out is preparing in case the situation changes.\\n\\nI think if you're going to travel — and I'm not saying that's a bad idea, I would really like to take a vacation myself — I think people should be aware that there's a possibility you could get stuck somewhere for an extended period of time, Watson said.\\n\\n[What you need to know about coronavirus]\\n\\nBc the corona virus has made Italy a level 3: 'do not travel to if u can help it' zone me my sister and my mom are calling to see where we can go instead of Italy lol — ahtzy (@bwabiewonnie) March 1, 2020\\n\\nShe said during a trip, travelers should watch for news of changes and adjust their behavior accordingly if the disease is circulating in a community by staying away from public places, anyone who appears sick and large gatherings of people.\\n\\nSome countries are restricting where people can go or whether anyone is allowed to enter from affected areas, which could interfere with travel plans.

The CDC said it may be possible for someone to get the coronavirus by touching something that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but it's still not known how long the virus can survive on surfaces.\\n\\nThe basics are key to preventing infection, Courtney Kansler, senior health intelligence analyst at WorldAware, said in an email.\\n\\nThis includes frequent hand washing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are unavailable, she said. Use social distancing and avoid obviously sick people. Transit quickly through airports or similarly crowded transportation hubs.\\n\\nTravelers who didn't buy travel insurance when they booked a trip should consider adding a medical policy before heading out, Squaremouth's Barto said — though coverage is limited. She said last week that about a third of providers on the site are offering coverage that would include the virus.\\n\\nI'm sincerely concerned about coronavirus, but I'm also worried about the insane amount of money my mom and I won't get back if travel is completely shut down in the next month 😰 — Jacqueline Buringa (@jackieburinga) February 28, 2020\\n\\nIf you plan future travel\\n\\nFor some travelers, no spreading virus will be enough to stifle wanderlust, especially with spring break and summer vacation season approaching.

But experts caution against merely picking a spot that has not yet seen a confirmed case.\\n\\nEvery day we see more and more countries reporting their first case of this virus, and in addition to that, we see countries known to have this virus reporting an increase, said Bogoch, the infectious diseases specialist, who has co-written research on the spread of the virus. If we're not calling this a pandemic, we're at least sitting at the precipice of a pandemic.\\n\\nQuigley said it's important for travelers to look constantly at the regulations and rules being enforced wherever they're going — and to realize everything could change if and when the World Health Organization declares a pandemic.\\n\\nThe responses will all be different, but clearly there will be a significant impact on travel both domestic and across borders, he said.\\n\\nTravelers considering where to go need to factor potential consequences of the virus' spread into their decision-making, said Roccaforte, of WorldAware. He said that includes the possibility of quarantines, travel restrictions, public transportation bans, food and water rationing, civil unrest and strained health-care systems.\\n\\n[Sign up for our coronavirus newsletter to stay updated on the outbreak]\\n\\nAnyone traveling should think about how they would find medical care if they got sick or hurt.\\n\\nThis is more important for people who have underlying health conditions, and it becomes even more important if there is an infectious disease outbreak, said Watson, of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\\n\\nThose making plans now still can buy insurance if they decide later to cancel because of coronavirus fears — though the policy won't be cheap.\\n\\nRight now, the only and best option we are recommending for people is a 'cancel for any reason' policy, Barto said. That's only available within the first 10 to 21 days of booking a trip, she said, and it costs about 40 percent more than a standard cancellation policy.

{"original": "There's no way we lost Georgia, there is no way. This was such a rigged election.\\n\\nFrom his first sentence, Trump starts to lie. He lost Georgia, narrowly, to Joe Biden.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI've had two elections. I won both of them. It's amazing. And I actually did much better on the second one.\\n\\nA signature line of Trump's rallies is that he only once ran for political office — for president — and he won. (That's not true, as he briefly sought the Reform Party nomination in 2000.) Here, he's trying to adjust his line by falsely claiming he won the second election — even though he lost.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRight here in Georgia, there were tens of thousands of illegal votes cast and counted. You know that.\\n\\nThere is no evidence this is the case. Georgia election officials insist the count was accurate. The vote was counted, then counted by hand and then recounted again. Officials say there is no evidence of widespread fraud.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n10,315 ballots were cast by individuals whose name and date of birth matches a Georgia resident who died in 2020 prior to the election. And your wacky secretary of state said two people, two people. 66,000 votes in Georgia were cast by people under the legal voting age. At least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to the November 3 election.\\n\\nThese are old chestnuts. Trump is citing claims made by Bryan Geels, a certified public accountant who owns a data analytics firm, and Matt Braynard, a former Trump campaign staffer and election data analyst. Geels came up with the first two figures and Braynard the third. But they were rejected by state officials in December and again when Trump raised them in a phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Saturday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe sworn statements of both analysts contain caveats and disclaimers, noted the Atlantic Journal-Constitution in December. They asserted their findings with 'a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.' They acknowledged their analyses could have produced 'false positives' — cases in which votes were legitimately cast. They admitted they didn't have access to state data that would allow them to be certain of their findings. … In sworn statements filed in court, election experts and state officials offered withering assessments of the analyses by Braynard and Geels.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder questioning at a state hearing, Braynard acknowledged his analyses included apparent errors. In my affidavit, I don't believe I specifically accused anybody of committing a crime, he said. I said these were indications. Over and over again, 'potential illegal ballots' has been my language.\\n\\nGeorgia's absentee ballot rejection rate went from an average of 3 percent in 2016 and then went down very low to almost zero. … If you multiply that out and this is with many, many more ballots pouring, it went to almost zero. … These absentee ballot rejection rates prove that the tens of thousands of illegitimate ballots were counted.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has been flogging this claim since November. But state officials have explained he's comparing incorrect data.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne of the numbers you're seeing out there is that a 3 percent rejection rate versus this 0.5 percent rejection rate, but they're comparing it to apples to oranges, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia's voting system implementation manager, said at Nov. 17 news conference. That is including [all rejected] ballots. The biggest chunk of ballots are rejected or counted as rejected showed up after the 7 p.m. deadline. That is where the majority of rejections come from. But for signature matches always run around 0.15 to 0.2 percent. That is the normal thing we've seen in Georgia for years.\\n\\nOfficials egregiously violated state laws in order to solicit, facilitate and promote cheating and theft on a scale never seen before. These crooked and incompetent officials suspended signature verification.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nActually, state officials say they strengthened the signature match process. A signature is checked when a voter requests a mail-in ballot and then again when the ballot is returned.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLet's address this disinformation about signature match, Raffensperger wrote on Facebook in November. We strengthened signature match. We helped train election officials on GBI [Georgia Bureau of Investigation] signature match — which is confirmed twice before a ballot is ever cast.\\n\\nI said, I want you to go to Fulton County to check the signatures because hundreds of thousands of ballots came in. I want you to check the signature to see if it compares to somebody that lived there two years, four years or six years ago.\\n\\nTrump is making up numbers here. There were only about 147,000 absentee ballots cast in Fulton County, making it impossible for hundreds of thousands of forged signatures. In any case, for privacy reasons, the envelope is separated from the ballot once the signature is confirmed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey put these drop boxes there and in a number of cases, they'd be gone for three days. … Where are they? Where are they? They were gone.\\n\\nThe secretary of state's counsel, Ryan Germany, previously told the state House Government Affairs Committee that video reviews found this to be false.\\n\\nGeorgia's secretary of state agreed to a litigation settlement, which is something that nobody's ever seen. One like this. I want to just tell you that [voting rights advocate] Stacey Abrams took him to the cleaners, that drastically and illegally changed the state's election procedures.\\n\\nThe litigation settlement refers to a legal settlement signed in March, after a lawsuit by the Democratic Party, that set statewide standards for judging signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. The Democrats had argued that minorities ended up having a larger proportion of their ballots rejected, so the settlement laid out steps to notify voters if there was a potential problem with a signature match. Under the settlement, voters must be contacted the next business day — by phone or email — if their absentee ballot is rejected because of a signature issue.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe State of Georgia entered a consent decree that essentially did one thing and one thing only … instead of giving three days to inform a voter there was an issue with their ballot, [it] is down to 24 hours when you're within 11 days of the election, Sterling said on Nov. 17. That is the one and only thing that that consent order addressed in any real way.\\n\\nRaffensperger, in a Facebook post in November, noted that the rejection rate from 2018 to 2020 was the exact same. … So, the idea that some settlement agreement that we entered into changed how counties were doing this is basically nonsense.\\n\\nThe most unhappy person right now anywhere in the United States is Hillary Clinton, because she's asking the Democrat Party, why the hell didn't you do this for me? Through? Why didn't you do it for me?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump baselessly suggests the Democrats could have stolen the 2016 election but chose not to do it.\\n\\nMake sure your vote is counted. Make sure they don't let you say: 'I'm sorry. Somebody else has already voted for you.' \\n\\nThis has been a persistent claim by the Trump campaign in various states — that Trump supporters went to vote, only to find their ballot had already been cast (presumably by Democratic operatives) and thus they were given a provisional ballot. No evidence has ever emerged to prove this. There have no reports of anyone being turned away on Election Day, Raffensperger told CBS Evening News, noting the situation described by Trump surely would have been reported.\\n\\nWhen you win in a landslide and they steal it and it's rigged, it's not acceptable. Not acceptable.\\n\\nNot only did Trump lose the electoral college by 306-232 — a result that in 2016 he called a landslide — but he lost the popular vote by more than 7 million.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen we got ballots in from the military with Trump all over it and they got thrown into a river, you saw that. They threw ballots into a river from the military with my name all over it. We want Trump, boom, goes into the river.\\n\\nTrump appears to make a Frankenstein-claim out of two separate, previous stories of missing ballots. The president often says a large number of military ballots were found in a garbage can in Pennsylvania. Luzerne County, Pa., officials explained in a statement that a temporary seasonal independent contractor … incorrectly discarded [nine ballots] into the office trash during that person's three-day period of employment. The county's top election official caught wind, fired the employee and launched an investigation. The Justice Department at first said all nine ballots were for Trump, violating ballot secrecy, before issuing an unusual correction to note that, actually, seven were for Trump. The department did not, however, say how many — if any — of these ballots were from military personnel.\\n\\nSometimes the president claims that Trump ballots were dumped in a river. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany previously explained that this claim was a reference to an investigation in Wisconsin. Some lost mail in Wisconsin was found on the side of a road and in a ditch line in Greenville, a small town of about 12,000 people outside the city of Appleton. The mail was supposed to be in transit to the post office, according to the Outagamie County Sheriff's Office. Several absentee ballots were found among three trays of mail, according to the sheriff's office. Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe announced that she'd been informed by post office officials that no Wisconsin ballots were among the lost mail.\\n\\nRegardless, it is not clear how the president mashed these two false tales together. There is no evidence that military ballots with Trump all over it were thrown into a river.\\n\\nWe won the largest share of non-White vote of any Republican president in 60 years.\\n\\nExit polls only go back to 1972, but this is false. While exit polls indicate Trump received 26 percent of the non-White vote, that still would fall short of the 27 percent share that George W. Bush received in 2004.\\n\\nMexico is paying for the wall. If I were here, that would be because we were going to charge him a nice fee right at the entry points. And they were paying for the wall.\\n\\nSaying it does not make it so. Mexico is not paying for Trump's border barrier. U.S. taxpayers are paying, via money Trump diverted from authorized military construction projects.\\n\\nThis was perhaps Trump's most famous campaign promise — during the 2016 campaign, Trump more than 200 times said Mexico would pay for the wall — so he simply pretends that Mexico, in some way, is paying for the project or will in the future, in some ill-defined way, such as through a toll. But he has proposed no actual policy to implement this idea — and neither has Mexico accepted it.\\n\\nAt one point, Trump even said the reworking of the North American Free Trade Agreement will earn enough money to pay for the wall. This betrays a misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not lose money on trade deficits, so there is no money to earn — or appropriate for the construction of a border barrier or anything else.\\n\\nThat is, you catch a criminal and you take his name. You say you're released into our country. I ended it. You're released. Come back in four years. We're going to take you to court. So far, nobody's ever shown up. I mean, literally, they almost don't show up and turn out. That's when I had the big debate with Biden. They come back for court. I said, no, they don't.\\n\\nThis is a regular complaint of the president's, but it was not accurate when he debated Biden and is not accurate now.\\n\\nThe chain of events that Trump describes — and calls catch and release — applies when someone first appeals for asylum. The United States follows the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which says that a refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts.\\n\\nThe vast majority — almost 85 percent of all deportations — in the United States are ordered quickly, without a hearing before a judge. Still, Justice Department data shows the vast majority of non-detained migrants given a court date have returned and attended their immigration court proceedings. For asylum seekers, data suggests the return rate is even higher.\\n\\nIn other words, Trump was wrong and Biden was right.\\n\\nIt'll be the largest tax increase in the history of our country.\\n\\nBiden has proposed a significant tax increase over 10 years, with about three-quarters of the increase paid by the top 1 percent of households. It was initially estimated at $4 trillion by the Tax Policy Center, a figure often used by Trump, but a more recent analysis pegged it at $2.1 trillion. (Note: an earlier version of this fact check originally linked only to the first estimate.)\\n\\nBut Trump is wrong to claim this would be the biggest tax increase in history. When comparing revenue bills over many decades, percentage of the gross domestic product is the correct measure, not nominal dollars. Calculations by the Treasury Department show that tax increases in 1941 and 1942 were a larger share of the economy. Tax increases in 1951 and 1968 were also larger, but they were designed to be temporary and so are harder to compare to Biden's proposed tax hike.\\n\\nIn the first year, Biden's tax plan would increase federal revenue by 0.68 percent of GDP [gross domestic product], making it the tenth largest tax increase since the 1940s, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation. In the second year of Biden's plan, when the temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit expires, the plan would increase federal revenue by 1.52 percent of GDP, tying for the fourth largest tax increase as a share of GDP since the 1940s. The biggest tax increase, the Revenue Act of 1942, boosted revenues 5.04 percent of GDP.\\n\\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\\n\\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter"}
{"original": "Responding to a question from Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) about Trump's apparent public solicitation of compromising materials on his campaign rivals from Russia and China, White House Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin ventured a sweeping defense of the president's remarks — claiming they did not, in fact, represent a violation of campaign finance laws that make it illegal to accept or solicit a thing of value from foreign sources.\\n\\nMere information is not something that would violate the campaign finance laws, he said. If there is credible information, credible information of wrongdoing by someone who is running for a public office, it's not campaign interference for credible information about wrongdoing to be brought to light.\\n\\nThat left Democrats nothing short of irate, accusing Philbin of engaging in a wholesale rewrite of federal law to cover for Trump.\\n\\nApparently it's okay for the president to get information from foreign governments in an election — that's news to me, said Rep.

And this is where, every time she outgrows another size, things get ugly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYes, Alice has an older brother, and she would be overjoyed to wear his hand-me-downs, assuming they weren't demolished by the time he's finished with them, which is rare.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut also, Alice is a petite 5-year-old. She swims in clothing cut for boys — even the toddler sizes. As Alice will tell you, she's a girl who likes boy stuff. She doesn't mind being confused for a boy, and when asked why she dresses like one, will respond, I can wear whatever I want. She may be unfazed, but she doesn't exactly like having to explain herself, either.\\n\\nAs anyone who's been in a major retailer recently can tell you, it's slim pickings out there for girls who love Batman and Diplodocus. And if you're a boy who loves ballet or slogans love makes the world go round? Well, that one pretty much answers itself.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 2017, the world has changed enough that Target now carries girl-sized dino T-shirts. Among the pastel blandishments to Smile! is one proclaiming the wearer as Future President. Lands' End has a couple with Pluto and Saturn, which happen to be Alice's favorite stellar bodies. I know all of this because I scour various sites when the sales hit my inbox, looking for clothes that are affordable and will let my kid express herself the way she wants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI've seen the indie clothing websites, where kids defy stereotypes in organic cotton. I'm glad they're out there. But it's invariably $30 for a T-shirt and they rarely go on sale. Either that, or the science- and ninja- patterns only come in dresses, because there's only so many stereotypes girls should challenge at a time. (Alice hasn't tolerated a dress since she was 18 months old, so those are out, too.)\\n\\nAnd what about all the families who don't have the money or patience to look beyond the local big box store? What should they do for girls who love Iron Man? What about the boys who want a shirt with Rey from Star Wars, not Kylo Ren?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWell, they're finally getting a few options.

{"original": "Mueller's probe became a lightning rod for criticism under House Republican leadership, as GOP members alleged that bias displayed by certain FBI and Justice Department officials working on probes of Trump and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server compromised the origins of Mueller's probe. Their concerns drove a year-long investigation into the agencies' conduct, while Democrats charged that GOP lawmakers were simply trying to help the president undermine Mueller.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow that Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is leading the House for her third term, she faces a tricky political landscape and a big agenda. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThose Democrats, now in charge, say the further Mueller's probe progresses, the more endangered he may be. And they have no faith that acting attorney general Matthew G. Whitaker — who ignored Justice Department ethics recommendations to recuse himself from supervising Mueller's probe — will stand up to Trump if he orders Mueller's firing.\\n\\nAs the Special Counsel announced new indictments and guilty pleas from Trump's closest allies and associates, it's clear that the threat to the Mueller investigation will only grow stronger, Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) wrote in a statement with Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.) and Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.). Now is the time for Congress to finally act and pass this legislation to protect the integrity of the Special Counsel's investigation and the rule of law.\\n\\nDemocrats will easily be able to pass the bill in the House, with or without significant Republican support. But the bill faces difficult odds in the Senate, where the bulk of the GOP has eschewed the measure's approach, either because they believe Trump would not be so politically reckless as to order his attorney general to fire Mueller or because they believe it would set an undesirable constitutional precedent by making the president's staffing decisions subject to judicial review.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNonetheless, the fact that House Democrats made the Mueller protection bill their opening salvo, just hours after taking over the majority, signals the importance and influence the special counsel's probe and its findings will have as Democratic lawmakers use their committee gavels to investigate all aspects of Trump's orbit.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in an interview with NBC's Today that Democratic leaders would not make a decision about whether to pursue impeachment of Trump until Mueller released his findings. Thus far, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) has announced plans to reintroduce articles of impeachment against the president, but the effort has not been embraced by leaders of the Judiciary Committee, where such proceedings would take place.\\n\\nIn the meantime, various panels have committed to do everything from release Trump's tax returns to challenge his zero-tolerance border policy that has resulted in the separation of immigrant children from their parents, as well as their detention. Those probes, however, are not expected to begin in earnest until later this month, after leaders have determined which members will sit on each committee — decisions panel leaders aren't expecting until later next week, due to leaders' immediate focus on ending the partial government shutdown.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said Thursday that his top priority will be a good-governance bill that addresses voting rights and money in politics — and then, the census.\\n\\nThe Trump administration announced last year that it would be adding a question about citizenship status to the 2020 Census, prompting a spate of court challenges and public charges that the administration is trying to suppress responses from immigrant-heavy communities. Cummings plans to challenge that decision — and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for his claims about it — in a hearing before his panel.\\n\\nLate Wednesday, the Senate confirmed Steve Dillingham as the new director of the U.S. Census Bureau."}
{"original": "While EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler signed the final rule last week, he announced it Tuesday at a virtual session hosted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that advocates fewer federal regulations and disputes the idea that climate change poses a major threat to the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe American public deserves to know which studies we are using to craft our regulations, Wheeler said. We want to make all this information available to the public and shine some light on it.\\n\\nMany of the nation's leading researchers and academic organizations, however, argue that the criteria will actually restrict the EPA from using some of the most consequential research on human subjects because it often includes confidential medical records and other proprietary data that cannot be released because of privacy concerns.\\n\\nThe people pushing it are claiming it's in the interest of science, but the entire independent science world says it's not, said Chris Zarba, a former director of the EPA's Science Advisory Board who retired in 2018 after nearly four decades at the agency. It sounds good on the surface. But this is a bold attempt to get science out of the way so special interests can do what they want.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe new standards affect not just significant regulatory actions, according to the new rule, but also influential scientific information that the EPA shares with the public, on its websites and elsewhere.\\n\\nThe rule reflects the Trump administration's dogged push to lock in as many policies as possible before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. Although the new administration will probably seek to overturn it, such an effort will take months, if not longer. The EPA administrator is allowed to waive the requirement on a case-by-case basis, but it is possible that outside groups could challenge those waivers in court.\\n\\nForcing researchers to disclose their raw data has for years been a top priority for conservative Republicans — including some now working in the EPA's upper ranks. The new rule was modeled on a bill championed by former House Science Committee chairman Lamar Smith (R-Tex.). One of the panel's former staffers, Richard Yamada, helped write an early version of the regulation while serving at the EPA.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConservatives have been particularly critical of two studies that have spurred increased regulation: a 1993 Harvard University Six Cities project that linked air pollution to premature deaths and a Columbia University analysis of a widely used pesticide, chlorpyrifos, that suggested the chemical causes neurological damage in babies.\\n\\nAccording to a document obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Trump officials discussed how to block such research in a Jan. 25, 2018, briefing on the proposed rule. Referring to Harvard's Six Cities study and another pollution study conducted by the American Cancer Society, the notes read, The scientific community has identified major shortcomings in the methodologies and findings of these studies, all of which could be addressed if EPA provided the underlying data for independent review.\\n\\nIn the wake of protests from public health experts and congressional Democrats, the EPA revised the proposal so that it would not apply retroactively to past assessments of studies like the ones cited in the 2018 meeting.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Environmental Defense Fund General Counsel Vickie Patton, whose group obtained the document, said in an email that it reveals the Trump EPA is focused on attacking the peer-reviewed health science that has saved tens of thousands of lives each year from deadly air pollution and protected America's children from pesticides.\\n\\nAndrew Rosenberg, who directs the Union of Concerned Scientists' Center for Science and Democracy and regularly reviews scientific studies before they are published in academic journals, said that the agency's emphasis on the need for raw data is misplaced.\\n\\nAs a well-experienced peer reviewer, I very rarely scrutinize raw data, he said. Rather, I look at data collection and analysis methods, summary and other statistics and graphics and results and conclusions to determine the validity of a study and the strength of its scientific evidence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe EPA has not published estimates on how much it will cost to implement the rule and what effect it will have on public health.\\n\\nBecause researchers are particularly reluctant to release individual medical records used in human studies, Rosenberg said, the rule disproportionately affects epidemiological studies, which is ironic in the midst of a pandemic. Because these data can't be made public, EPA will ignore epidemiological evidence of population-level effects of contaminants, pollution and other environmental threats.\\n\\nWheeler said critics of the rule had distorted both its intent and its impact. He said that a pivotal study like the Harvard one, which has influenced key federal pollution standards that have saved thousands of lives and been economically beneficial, might still be able to inform future policies if the next administrator determines it is justified and publishes the reasoning behind that decision.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is no study that will automatically be cut out from review by the agency, he said. What this new rule would undoubtedly do is provide transparency needed to allow the public the opportunity needed to check our work.\\n\\nThe American Chemistry Council, the primary trade association for U.S. chemical companies, was among the supporters who welcomed the new rule.\\n\\nIt will strengthen EPA's regulatory process by helping ensure that it is relying on the best available science — science that is reliable and unbiased — and by making the underlying research and data publicly available in ways that protect personal privacy, confidential business information, proprietary interests and intellectual property rights, ACC spokesman Jon Corley said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThomas Sinks, who previously led the Office of the Science Advisor at the EPA and oversaw its rules on research involving human subjects, is among numerous scientists who note that the EPA already has a robust scientific integrity policy and a long-standing peer-review process for any data upon which it relies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is based on a conspiracy theory, which is that EPA practices secret science, Sinks, who wrote a forceful rebuke of the new rule before his retirement in September, said of the effort. But there's no evidence EPA practices secret science. I'm unaware of an example where EPA hasn't clearly stated what science it is using in its rulemaking.\\n\\nSinks said he also worries that Tuesday's final rule deepens the broader attack on science by the Trump administration, and that it could have a lasting impact that goes beyond any single regulation."}

I let my emotions and genuine excitement get the best of me, and I wanted to share that moment with our fans, Brown said in a statement posted to his Twitter account. It was wrong of me to do, against team and NFL policy, and I have apologized to Coach Tomlin and my teammates for my actions.\\n\\nI'm sorry to them for letting it become a distraction and something that they've had to answer questions about while we're preparing for a big game on Sunday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEarlier on Tuesday, Tomlin had called Brown foolish, selfish and inconsiderate for posting the video, which was seen by hundreds of thousands of Facebook users before the wide receiver took it down. The 44-year-old coach also apologized for the language he used, calling it regrettable.\\n\\nReferring to the fact that after the Patriots had defeated the Texans on Saturday, the Steeler's game at Kansas City was moved to Sunday night because of weather concerns, Tomlin had told his team, We just spotted these a——- a day and a half. Brown's video also caught Tomlin saying, We'll be ready for their a—-. But you ain't got to tell them we're coming.\\n\\nBrown, a five-time Pro Bowler who led the NFL in receptions in 2014 and 2015, was also chided by Roethlisberger. The locker room is a sacred place where things are said and hugs and tears, and it's kind of a special place. So a little disappointed with AB for that, Roethlisberger said Tuesday on a Pittsburgh radio show. Coach talks and then I talk, and you just don't want everyone to know what's going on in there with the family. And also, I wish AB would have been listening to Coach and myself instead of being on the other side of the locker room filming.\\n\\nTomlin said the Steelers won't suspend Brown, at least not while the team is in the playoffs, but will punish him swiftly. The NFL may also choose to punish Brown, possibly with a fine, given that he violated its social-media policy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe use of social media by coaches, players, and other club football operations personnel is prohibited on game day (including halftime) beginning 90 minutes before kickoff until after the post-game locker room is open to the media and players have first fulfilled their obligation to be available to the news media who are at the game, the policy states.

{"original": "Now, however, the New York firm — with $7.8 trillion in assets under management — could face its biggest threat yet, with Democratic control of the White House and influential figures on the left bent on breaking Wall Street apart.\\n\\nBut BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is entering this era in a unique position: Two of President-elect Joe Biden's senior economic advisers worked there in the years after they left the Obama administration.\\n\\nBrian Deese, who until Dec. 18 led sustainable investing at BlackRock, is Biden's pick to lead the White House National Economic Council. And Wally Adeyemo, who worked at BlackRock for just over two years, including as an interim chief of staff to founder Larry Fink, is slated to be deputy treasury secretary, with a direct hand in shaping the Biden administration's approach to financial regulation. Adeyemo left the firm in 2019 to lead the Obama Foundation.\\n\\nA Biden transition official said the incoming administration expects Deese and Adeyemo to recuse themselves from matters pertaining specifically to BlackRock for an appropriate period determined by law and an ethics agreement that is still in development. Still, their prominence within the top tier of Biden's economic team, and BlackRock's heavy investment in Washington influence in recent years, puts the company in a unique position heading into a period when its business lines could be coming under close scrutiny.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe firm's ability to emerge victorious during battles in the Obama administration offers clues about how it could seek to survive and thrive during Biden's time in office, and it presents the incoming administration with thorny questions about how it will seek to regulate a powerful firm with direct connections to its team.\\n\\nBlackRock has a lot at stake. Janet L. Yellen, Biden's nominee to run the Treasury Department, has been sharply critical of moves by the Trump administration to ease oversight of companies such as BlackRock. If Yellen tightens restrictions, the company could find itself in a much different regulatory environment, potentially forcing it to set aside more reserves and hire more compliance officials.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden on Dec. 1 introduced economist Janet L. Yellen to lead the Treasury amid a deep crisis. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nNo U.S. firm can match its presence across the global economy. It has made purchases on behalf of the Fed and holds 5 percent or more of the shares of nearly all the companies traded on the S&P 500, according to one analysis published in 2019.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, combining a deft touch and an unrelenting lobbying blitz, it has kept policymakers at bay and been allowed to continue growing.\\n\\nThe way that we proceeded reflected what I think was a correct view that you have to ask the questions without knowing the answers, said a former senior Obama administration official, who like other current and former officials interviewed for this report spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations or preserve working relationships. Candidly in some ways, the aggressive nature of the BlackRock advocacy made that harder, not easier.\\n\\nBlackRock said in a statement that as an asset manager, it is subject to regulation by a range of agencies, and that it supports regulatory reform that increases transparency, protects investors and facilitates responsible growth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe believe in the value of open dialogue and transparency on important policy issues, and over the last decade, as regulators around the world implemented new rules and regulations that have re-shaped the regulatory environment governing a wide range of asset management products and practices, we aimed to be a helpful contributor to this process, the company said.\\n\\nFormer officials who worked with Adeyemo and Deese pointed out that neither worked at BlackRock or other finance firms for long portions of their careers and said they believe it unlikely that they would have adopted the firm's views on financial regulation. Adeyemo previously worked for now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a frequent antagonist of Wall Street, at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. When he announced Adeyemo's nomination, Biden said he was highly recommended by Warren.\\n\\nNeither Adeyemo nor Deese consulted with BlackRock executives about the firm's engagement with the Treasury Department or regulators during their time with the company, said a person familiar with the matter.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Washington observers said that even if BlackRock does not lobby Deese and Adeyemo directly, the perception of the firm being well connected within the Biden team will give it extra sway at a critical time. Finance experts and former officials said the Biden administration will need to strengthen the very government institutions and regulatory mechanisms that BlackRock has spent years aggressively lobbying against, and some worried that BlackRock could try to use its connections to undermine tougher enforcement.\\n\\nThis is an area that the Biden administration really needs to take a close look at, and hopefully there aren't going to be conflicts of interest affecting things, said Marcus Stanley, policy director for Americans for Financial Reform, a liberal nonprofit group that advocates for stricter regulation of Wall Street. BlackRock's policy positions are very relevant to choices that the Biden administration is going to have to make.\\n\\nBiden transition spokeswoman Rosemary Boeglin said in an emailed statement that the incoming administration has committed to establishing the most ethically rigorous administration in American history.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll nominees and appointees will commit to following all appropriate ethics rules in their work, including by meeting financial disclosure requirements, stepping down from outside positions, divesting assets, and recusing themselves from matters as required by federal ethics rules, their agencies, and the White House, Boeglin said.\\n\\nBlackRock is a massive financial company, but it is not a bank. It does not take government-insured deposits. It is an asset manager, investing and holding money on behalf of clients.\\n\\nThe firm aggressively snapped up senior and mid-level Obama administration officials from the White House and Treasury Department, giving it connections that have now proved fortuitous with Biden's victory. And its political action committee and employees have given millions of dollars in campaign donations to politicians over the past decade, with more funds going to Democrats than Republicans, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.\\n\\nShortly after Barack Obama took office in 2009, BlackRock executives began meeting with mid-level and senior White House economics officials, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and, later, Chief of Staff William Daley, according to White House visitor logs. In 2014, Fink met three times with Jeff Zients, then the director of President Obama's National Economic Council and now slated to take on the role of coronavirus czar in the Biden administration.\\n\\nBecause it is not an investment bank — risk-taking in the investment banking sector helped cause the 2008 financial crisis — BlackRock could present itself as a constructive voice with useful perspectives on a range of issues facing policymakers, former officials said. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York turned to BlackRock for help in 2008, asking it to oversee failing assets held by Bear Stearns and American International Group. During meetings at the White House and in Congress during the Obama era, Fink would offer his insights on the health-care industry, infrastructure and gig workers, said people who met with him. BlackRock has further honed this stance through its Investment Institute, a sort of internal think tank that publishes bulletins with commentary on geopolitics, and an entire section on its website devoted to commentary on financial stability.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut BlackRock's engagement in Washington took on a different tenor when it came to the prospect of regulations it saw as a serious threat to the firm's business model. Former Obama officials and congressional aides pointed to how BlackRock reacted to the possibility of being named a systemically important non-bank financial institution by regulators, another way of saying the company was too big to fail.\\n\\nSuch a designation, a power granted by Congress to a group of regulators called the Financial Stability Oversight Council, could have cut into BlackRock's profits by requiring it to set aside more capital reserves or hire more compliance specialists, for instance, and it would have placed BlackRock under the direct supervision of the Fed. In late 2013, news leaked that the FSOC was reviewing BlackRock and Fidelity, another asset manager, as it studied the issue.\\n\\nFormer officials said the chances of BlackRock actually being designated were minimal, but the firm still unleashed what they saw as a disproportionate, aggressive lobbying effort, blanketing congressional aides and regulators directly and via industry trade groups with meeting requests, letters and white papers laying out their views.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBlackRock's main position has been that instead of targeting individual firms, regulators ought to review potentially risky activities in a sector, such as exchange-traded funds. Opponents of the activities-based approach say such a method would not have prevented the 2008 financial collapse.\\n\\nBut former officials said much of their frustration with BlackRock stemmed not from any specific policy position but rather what they saw as the firm's aggressiveness and its willingness to exaggerate regulators' actions to members of Congress. They viewed its bare-knuckles approach in Washington as contrary to its public stance of praising regulators for their actions after the 2008 crisis.\\n\\nYou cannot do financial regulatory policy without some measure of trust in regulators' judgment, said a former Obama-era Treasury Department official. BlackRock's efforts were not just focused on policy changes but were focused on undermining that trust.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther officials said they found BlackRock to be sincere in its effort to educate policymakers about complex lines of business.\\n\\nI did find them to be very knowledgeable, said one former Obama-era regulator who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal meetings. They did lots of research and published the findings of that research, thought about the issues and commented on the issues in a thoughtful way.\\n\\nSpurred by BlackRock's push, members of the GOP-led Congress held public hearings in which they lacerated Obama administration officials and criticized their decision-making process as opaque.\\n\\nIn a related episode, BlackRock also led a charge to discredit the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research (OFR), created by Congress in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The agency was designed to be an independent bureau empowered to demand data from Wall Street giants, shed light on opaque financial markets and hold its own against the same regulators who had missed the warning signs before the 2008 crash.\\n\\nFour former officials said BlackRock's lobbyists were by far the most vocal in pushing back against a 34-page September 2013 OFR report on the asset management industry that concluded those firms could pose a risk to financial stability. The report had been commissioned by the FSOC to help it figure out a framework for judging whether such firms were systemically important.\\n\\nFor its part, BlackRock felt the OFR report had not been prepared transparently, unhappy that it was granted just two meetings a year apart, to engage with the agency on the report, said a person familiar with the matter. The firm filed six letters with the Securities and Exchange Commission commenting on the OFR report between November 2013 and May 2014. By comparison, its three biggest competitors in the asset management industry — Vanguard, Fidelity and State Street — filed five letters total. The fallout over the report permanently damaged the OFR's reputation, several former officials said, and eroded its support in Congress.\\n\\nFormer officials attributed BlackRock's aggressive approach to vice chair and firm co-founder Barbara Novick, who has a reputation as a dogged, dedicated operator who makes it her job to get to know everyone, from 24-year-old entry-level agency staffers to senior White House advisers, Republicans and Democrats.\\n\\nWe believe policy decisions should be data driven, and we have approached advocacy by publishing educational materials drawing on data and facts, Novick said in a statement. We are proud of our contributions to policy issues that impact investors globally.\\n\\nNovick and her staff made themselves ubiquitous, spreading their influence through industry groups such as the Managed Funds Association, the Investment Company Institute, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, officials said.\\n\\nThere are some companies or trade associations who will wait until a particular issue gathers momentum before intervening, but BlackRock seems pretty determined to quash anything, one former Democratic congressional aide said. They don't miss anything, and they intervene early and often.\\n\\nBy 2014, BlackRock had notched a key victory when the FSOC announced it would focus on potentially risky activities rather than labeling individual firms as risks.\\n\\nIn 2019, the Trump administration went further, overhauling the process by which the FSOC could assess the risks presented by non-bank financial firms and making it unlikely, experts said, that any company would draw tighter regulation. The new approach, which among other changes requires a cost-benefit analysis before a company is designated, was hailed in its draft form by BlackRock, in a 72-page submission complete with appendixes, as a very significant improvement on the existing process.\\n\\nDennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets, an advocacy group that favors more robust Wall Street oversight, said the changes created this Rube Goldberg set of procedures that make it almost impossible for the FSOC to ever designate any activity as systemically significant and even harder to designate any entity, either.\\n\\nIt is entirely consistent with everything the shadow banking system lobbyists all wanted, including asset managers, private equity firms, hedge funds and others, said Kelleher, who is a volunteer with the Biden transition team.\\n\\nThe new approach drew rare public criticism from four former senior U.S. economic officials, including Yellen. She and her colleagues wrote in a letter that the changes would make it impossible to prevent the build-up of risk in financial institutions whose failure would threaten the stability of the system as a whole.\\n\\nThe Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment on the 2019 guidance. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's former counselor at the agency, Craig Phillips, was a managing director at BlackRock before he joined the Trump administration.\\n\\nIn her new role, Yellen could try to rescind the guidance and push the FSOC to increase its scrutiny of non-bank financial firms. A Biden transition official said that there is no daylight between Yellen and Adeyemo on financial regulation and that Adeyemo agrees with Yellen's stance in the 2019 letter.\\n\\nAnother major issue regulators were examining in the years after the financial crisis was what kinds of new rules to institute for money-market funds, which are not guaranteed by the federal government like regular bank accounts but which still typically serve as risk-free places for investors to store cash. They are run by asset managers such as BlackRock.\\n\\nIn 2008, when investors fled money-market funds, the Fed had to step in to prevent further mayhem. In response, the FSOC proposed three possible changes in November 2012 and questioned the wisdom of an approach BlackRock had advocated months earlier, for liquidity fees that would activate only in times of crisis. But the FSOC could only recommend rules, and it was then up to the SEC to debate and adopt them.\\n\\nNovick filed a letter with the FSOC pushing back against its proposals. Then she and her team met with SEC officials around a week before Christmas in 2012, presenting their views in PowerPoint form. BlackRock was one of many Wall Street players that lobbied the SEC during this time period, including Vanguard, Fidelity and Federated. BlackRock also organized a 2013 letter that suggested a new definition for retail money-market funds, which the SEC ended up adopting.\\n\\nThe eventual changes adopted by the SEC in 2014 were weaker than what the FSOC had proposed. They incorporated liquidity fees and were greeted with cautious praise by industry players. Now, those who wanted stronger regulations feel they have been vindicated. In March, as investors rushed to pull money out of the market during the first weeks of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed was forced to intervene, announcing it would establish a special backstop for money-market funds, among several other emergency actions. The industry was effectively bailed out again.\\n\\nBlackRock has already moved to shape the discussion around further measures, issuing a paper in July that deflected blame for the instability away from money-market funds.\\n\\nThe turmoil last spring revealed unstable practices in parts of the asset management industry, including in money-market funds, said Sheila Bair, former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp."}
{"original": "The bans have taken an immeasurable toll since they were enacted. Ramez Alghazzouli, a Syrian American man, was separated from his wife Asmaa for years before she was able to receive a visa and reunite with him in the United States. This can destroy a human being. I'm not an emotional guy but it distracted and destroyed me, Alghazzouli has said of his family's journey. His story is one of thousands.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA few weeks ago, as part of our nearly four-year-long fight against the bans, our coalition met with members of the Biden transition team to reiterate the urgent need for repeal, make specific recommendations to address the harms suffered by those impacted, and underscore the need to undo the bigotry the bans are premised on. These are critical steps as we continue to work for a more just and inclusive America.\\n\\nFirst, the Biden administration should work to reunite families separated by the bans by expediting consideration of visas for those who have been refused or held in administrative limbo. More than 41,000 people have been refused visas based on the bans. The stories of those affected include Yassin Terou, a recently naturalized Syrian American restaurant owner who has been indefinitely separated from his ailing and nearly 70-year-old father. Or Mohammed Salem Ali, a 64-year-old Somali man living in Malaysia whose wife and children were admitted as refugees 10 years ago, and who dreams of attending his daughter's college graduation next spring. Reuniting families is not only a policy imperative; it is core to our country's social and moral fabric. The Biden administration must make amends for the immense harm sustained by individuals and families, including Americans.\\n\\nSecond, the next administration should increase refugee numbers from the countries impacted by the bans. The number of refugee admissions has decreased dramatically after the initial admission of more than 207,000 refugees in 1980, when the Refugee Act was passed. For 2020, President Trump set the number at just 18,000, having already severely restricted refugee resettlement from nearly a dozen Muslim-majority nations through his so-called refugee ban. Meanwhile, Syrians who have suffered from a nearly decade-long civil war continue to be barred indefinitely, and Yemenis who have witnessed a near-total health-care and economic collapse are denied refuge. Biden's intent to increase refugee admissions to 125,000 is welcome, but to truly heal the wounds from the incalculable harm inflicted by the bans, including Trump's refugee ban, the incoming administration must prioritize admissions from impacted countries. Doing so will help restore the United States' promise as a haven; failing to do so risks repeating the tragic mistakes of our past.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFinally, the Biden administration must take steps to address the deeper context from which such prejudiced policies arose in the first place. The bans are premised on the false and bigoted claim that African, Muslim and other communities constitute an inherent threat to our country's national security. Other policies pre-dating the bans have long been justified on the same premise. Biden's administration should consult with these communities, their leaders, and grass-roots organizations serving them to ensure they are no longer treated as suspect. It must end discriminatory policing and surveillance programs, such as the Department of Homeland Security's Countering Violent Extremism and the targeting of Black, Arab, South Asian, and other communities under policing partnerships such as the Joint Terrorism Task Force. These programs treat Black and brown people as suspect and inherently violent, criminalizing our communities and eroding trust while failing to achieve their own stated goals. Our communities deserve safety and dignity, not suspicion and bigotry.\\n\\nRepealing the bans is a promising start, and we welcome the steps being taken by Biden's transition team to deliver that long-awaited relief. But repeals must go hand in hand with deliberate steps that reflect the promise we all seek from this nation: building an inclusive vision of what the United States can be, valuing immigrants and refugees based on our shared humanity, and providing true sanctuary to all.\\n\\nA repeal of the bans does not finish the work. It only begins it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) misconstrued the proposal as a broad-based tax hike on all income:\\n\\nAs did anti-tax lobbyist Grover Norquist, likening it to slavery:\\n\\nBut left-leaning economists note the proposal is hardly radical, given rates that high — and higher — were on the books for for the top income bracket amid the prosperous middle decades of the last century. And some recent research (including from Nobel-winning economist Peter Diamond) argues a top rate slightly north of 70 percent is optimal for the ultra-rich. (The idea also drew praise from at least one figure on the right, with Ann Coulter tweeting she agrees.) Julián Castro, the former Obama administration housing chief moving toward a presidential bid, pointed to history in endorsing Ocasio-Cortez's idea during a Sunday appearance on ABC's This Week.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs my colleague Dave Weigel noted, Castro's breezy co-signing signals just how quickly the tax policy discussion within the party can leap to the left:\\n\\nExpect other Democratic 2020 hopefuls to go there soon, too. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), for example, has said she wants to roll back Republican tax cuts passed in 2017. Though she has eschewed naming a number she would favor for a top marginal rate, she has pointed out it was well above 50 percent in the post-World War II era. And in her kickoff tour through Iowa this weekend, she said Washington needs to embrace big structural change to restore economic fairness.\\n\\nThe goal for aspiring Democratic leaders won't simply be extracting a pound of flesh from point-one-percenters. Ocasio-Cortez invoked the idea as a revenue source for a moonshot proposal — and her party's presidential pool will shortly be teeming with others looking to for ways to pay for similarly ambitious projects. (One estimate puts a $2.8 trillion price tag on Sen. Kamala D. Harris's proposal to offer tax credits or direct payments to lower and middle-income families.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Washington Post's Jeff Stein crunched the numbers with tax experts and found a new bracket for those earning more than $10 million a year would hit 16,000 households. Roughly doubling the rate they pay on income over that threshold, as a 70 percent rate would, could generate $720 billion over a decade. That could pay for a number of liberal dream programs. From Jeff: It could come close to funding the entirety of Sanders's free college tuition plan ($800 billion), fund President Barack Obama's plan to get close to universal prekindergarten ($75 billion over a decade), forgive more than half the student debt in America ($1.4 trillion), cover Democratic leaders' plan for boosting teacher pay and school funding ($100 billion), or come close to funding a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.\\n\\nThe soak-the-rich idea's early traction points to party in which the center of gravity has already moved measurably to the left. Barely two years ago, Hillary Clinton's platform called for imposing a surcharge on the incomes of those earning more than $5 million, effectively saddling them with a 44 percent top marginal rate. And four years before that, after winning a resounding reelection victory in part on a pledge to raise taxes on the rich, Obama signed a package that raised the top rate from 35 percent to 39.6 percent for couples earning more than $450,000 a year. Obama negotiated that deal with a Republican Congress.\\n\\nBut the fact remains that the Democrats' last two standard bearers proposed tax policy changes at the margins. The party's next one is likely to call for a much sharper departure.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMARKET MOVERS\\n\\n— Second thoughts on 2019 market forecasts. The Wall Street Journal's Michael Wursthorn and Akane Otani: The market's roller-coaster ride has prompted some Wall Street analysts to cut their 2019 forecasts, the latest sign of unease as the stock bull market approaches its 10th year. Major indexes rallied Friday after a stronger-than-expected jobs report boosted investors' confidence in the U.S. economy, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggested the central bank would be flexible with its policy plans.\\n\\nStill, a brutal December selloff and lingering worries about the health of the global economy have kept major indexes well below their records. Investors' confidence also took a hit after Apple Inc. late Wednesday slashed its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years due to slowing iPhone sales in China, raising anxieties that other companies could follow suit in a nod to the ramifications of ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.\\n\\nNervous investors seek refuge in yen and gold. WSJ's Ira Iosebashvili: Uneven economic data and volatility in stocks have accelerated a surge into assets perceived as relatively safe, highlighting the unease felt by many investors at the start of 2019. The Japanese yen is up nearly 5% against the dollar since markets began sliding at the end of last year's third quarter. That move picked up speed after weaker-than-expected manufacturing data and a sales warning from Apple Inc. last week bolstered fears of a global slowdown.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther so-called haven assets are also rising. Gold prices have strengthened around 7% in that period and stand near their highest level in about half a year, and gold-focused funds have notched inflows in 12 of the past 13 weeks ... The broad shift toward havens suggests that investors are now more eager to diversify their holdings in the face of recent market swings.\\n\\nAmerica is a world leader ... in volatility. Bloomberg's Justina Lee: As the world's largest and deepest equity market, the U.S. tends to be the relatively steady hand among volatile peers. Not anymore. The country is at the epicenter of global market anxieties from trade to monetary tightening and an economic slowdown. The U.S. gauge of future volatility, the VIX, has exceeded the equivalents in Europe, Hong Kong and even emerging markets a few times over the past month. This is an anomaly that's become more commonplace since the market sell-off in February 2018.\\n\\n— Powell attempts a soft landing. WSJ's Greg Ip, Nick Timiraos and Eric Moriath: Federal Reserve officials, after navigating the U.S. economy through the financial crisis and its rebound, face a fresh test in 2019: engineering an economic soft landing. The central bank's challenge is to manage a moderation in growth that keeps inflation contained but avoids a recession. It was a main topic at an annual economic conference in Atlanta this weekend that featured top current and former Fed officials. Investors will look this week to talks by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Vice Chairman Richard Clarida for new clues on the officials' thinking, as well as Wednesday's release of minutes from the Fed's December meeting.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGoldman sees Fed pausing. Jan Hatzius, the firm's chief economist, writes in a note this morning: Fed officials are acutely focused on both financial conditions and the growth outlook, at a time when they have the luxury to be 'patient' because core PCE inflation is at 1.9% year-on-year and unlikely to rise significantly for at least the next several months. This implies a pause in the rate hike process until conditions have settled down, as well as a strong incentive to sound market-friendly in the near term.\\n\\n— A majority of Britons want a Brexit re-do. CNBC: More Britons want to remain a member of the European Union than leave, according to a survey published on Sunday which also showed voters want to make the final decision themselves. Britain is due leave the EU on March 29, but Prime Minister Theresa May is struggling to get her exit deal approved by parliament, opening up huge uncertainty over whether a deal is possible, or even whether the country will leave at all.\\n\\nThe survey by polling firm YouGov showed that if a referendum were held immediately, 46 percent would vote to remain, 39 percent would vote to leave, and the rest either did not know, would not vote, or refused to answer the question. When the undecided and those who refused to answer were removed from the sample, the split was 54-46 in favor of remaining. That is broadly in line with other polls in recent months which show a deeply divided electorate, in which opinion has swung slightly towards remaining in the EU.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTRUMP TRACKER\\n\\nTRADE FLY-AROUND:\\n\\n— Trade talks with China finally get underway. CNN's Donna Borak: Trump claims his administration is 'doing very well in negotiations with China,' but the US team heading to Beijing this week is starting almost from scratch. While China has made some preemptive concessions in the weeks since Trump met with his counterpart Xi Jinping in Argentina, including lowering auto tariffs and restarting purchases of American soybeans, little concrete progress has been made toward developing a comprehensive trade agreement between Beijing and Washington.\\n\\nInstead, the meeting of deputy-level negotiators will give each side a chance to take stock and serve as a litmus test for whether a deal can be achieved before March 1, when Trump has threatened to impose another round of tariffs and to raise duties on imports to 25% from 10%. 'Next week's negotiations are important because they will establish expectations,' said Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce. 'However, we shouldn't expect major breakthroughs next week.'\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPositive sign? Liu He joins talks. Bloomberg: Chinese Vice Premier Liu He unexpectedly attended the first day of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies, according to people familiar with the matter and a photo seen by Bloomberg. Liu is the top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who led previous negotiations in Washington that produced a deal that President Donald Trump then repudiated. China had previously said the talks would be led by a lower-ranking official from the Ministry of Commerce.\\n\\nChinese economy slows as trade talks loom. WSJ's Lingling Wei: China's economy is slowing faster than expected as Beijing this week heads into a crucial new round of negotiations with the U.S. over trade. For the past couple of months, senior Chinese officials have sought to play down the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions on the world's second-largest economy, telling the public the conflict is doing little more than hurting the nation's stock indexes, making it a good time to buy China again. ...\\n\\n[But] the Trump administration's trade offensive, say the people and business executives, is hitting China's export-oriented manufacturing sector especially hard, reducing new orders for business and forcing factories to cut production and delay decisions on investing and hiring.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nU.S. has leverage in trade talks, Trump says. Alan Rappeport and Jim Tankersley at the New York Times: Trump is cheerleading his way past the economic warning signs that have rattled financial markets and unnerved economists, insisting that the United States has an advantage in a crucial first round of trade negotiations beginning on Monday in Beijing. It helps his case that the Labor Department published a jobs report for December that soared past expectations.\\n\\n'China's not doing very well now,' Mr. Trump said in a news conference at the White House, hours after the report came out on Friday. 'It puts us in a very strong position. We are doing very well.' Mr. Trump is correct about China's economy, which by several measures appears to be hobbled by American tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports. But the president's confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats.\\n\\nMeet in the middle? Given the stakes, Horizon Investment's Greg Valliere predicts progress. Both sides have compelling reasons to act – China quite clearly is suffering from an economic slowdown, and Donald Trump obviously fears that a nervous stock market could imperil his re-election, he writes in his morning note. Thus we believe there will be a constructive statement tomorrow, with hints that high-level officials will meet later this month to hammer out an agreement in principle.\\n\\n— Tariffs, not jobs for the industrial U.S. Peter S. Goodman at the NYT: Plants in every direction shut down and moved their operations to Mexico, succumbing to the relentless pressure to cut costs in an age of globalization. Not EBW Electronics. As the decades passed, the family-owned business stayed put, on the eastern edge of Lake Michigan, churning out lights for the auto industry. But now, the company's management is reluctantly mulling the possibility of moving its production to Mexico to escape the tariffs that President Trump has put on imported components, his primary weapons in a trade war waged in the name of bringing jobs home to America.\\n\\n'It's killing us,' said the chairman of the company, Pat LeBlanc, 63, a Republican who voted for Mr. Trump. He now expects the president's tariffs will chop his 2019 profits in half. 'I just feel so betrayed. If we fail because the company is being harmed by the government, that just makes me sick.' Across the industrial United States, including in the crucial political battleground state of Michigan, such complaints are intensifying as the trade war disrupts factory operations that depend on imported parts.\\n\\nMELTDOWN WATCH:\\n\\nPOCKET CHANGE\\n\\n— On the front lines of the app wars. The Post's Brian Fung: A growing number of software companies are looking to bypass the dominant app store gatekeepers at Apple and Google — selling their services directly to consumers and undercutting the tech giants that for years have controlled how most of iPhone and Android users discover, download and pay for their apps.\\n\\nThe revolt is being led by companies such as Netflix, which became the latest firm to cut off a lucrative relationship for Apple when it confirmed that new customers will no longer be able to pay their monthly subscription fees through iTunes. Instead, subscribers are being redirected to make payments on Netflix's own website. ... Netflix's announcement could save it hundreds of millions of dollars, and is potentially devastating for Apple.\\n\\n— When box stores use a tax loophole, small towns bear the brunt. NYT's Patricia Cohen: With astonishing range and rapidity, big-box retailers and corporate giants are using an aggressive legal tactic to shrink their property tax bills, a strategy that is costing local governments and school districts around the country hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. These businesses — many of them brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Home Depot, Target, Kohl's, Menards and Walgreens that have faced fierce online competition — maintain that no matter how valuable a thriving store is to its current owner, these warehouse-type structures are not worth much to anyone else.\\n\\nSo the best way to appraise their property, they contend in their tax appeals, is to look at the sale prices on the open market of vacant or formerly vacant shells in other places. As shuttered stores spread across the landscape, their argument has resonated. To municipalities, these appeals amount to a far-fetched tax dodge that allows corporations to wriggle out of paying their fair share.\\n\\n— Possible liquidation looms over Sears. Bloomberg News's Eliza Ronalds-Hannon, Lauren Coleman-Lochner, Nabila Ahmed, Lily Katz and Tiffany Kary: Sears Holdings Corp. is preparing a potential wind down after Chairman Eddie Lampert's bid to buy several hundred stores out of bankruptcy fell short of bankers' qualifications ... The iconic retailer started laying the groundwork for a liquidation after meetings Friday in which its advisers weighed the merits of a $4.4 billion bid by Lampert's hedge fund to buy Sears as a going concern ... If the 125-year-old retailer does die in bankruptcy — like Toys R Us in 2018, and Borders Group Inc. in 2011 — it would mark the largest fatality yet in the retail apocalypse prompted by a shift to online shopping.\\n\\nMONEY ON THE HILL\\n\\nHere's what you missed at President Trump's Jan. 4 news conference on the 14th day of the partial government shutdown. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)\\n\\n— Shutdown drags on with no end in sight. The Post's Bob Costa and co.: Trump administration officials began taking extraordinary steps to contain the fallout from the partial federal government shutdown Sunday, as the budget impasse between the president and congressional Democrats showed no signs of nearing a breakthrough.\\n\\nAs agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting White House budget director Russell T. Vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. It demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border...\\n\\nA Democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the White House hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.\\n\\nDAYBOOK\\n\\nCOMING SOON:\\n\\nTHE FUNNIES\\n\\n— From The New Yorker's Mick Stevens, circa 1998:\\n\\nBULL SESSION\\n\\nFrom California to Washington, shutdown takes toll on parks and museums\\n\\nPeople are streaming into national parks to find trash cans overflowing and restrooms locked.

{"original": "It's not just the Democratic female senator from Massachusetts who may feel compelled to come up with an answer. The 2020 presidential campaign is expected to include the largest-ever field of female candidates, all of them campaigning in the wake of the defeat of the first female nominee of a major party.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe reasons for Clinton's loss are still debated two years after the election. But even as Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was elected House speaker on Wednesday, the women looking at White House campaigns continue to shoulder gendered criticism and demands not placed on their male counterparts: to be strong but not too tough; to be assertive without being pushy, lest voters turn away for reasons that they may not acknowledge are sexist but that researchers say are.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe website McSweeney's covered the flap over Warren's likability with a report whose headline, while satirical, made a pungent point: I Don't Hate Women Candidates — I Just Hated Hillary and Coincidentally I'm Starting to Hate Elizabeth Warren.\\n\\nFor Democratic women running for president, it conjured what may be a preliminary contest in 2020: demonstrating they're not Hillary Clinton — nothing like her! — before they earn the nod to take on President Trump.\\n\\nThat obstacle was also placed before Democratic female candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, as Republicans tried to tie them directly to Clinton. It has also led some Democrats to openly wonder whether the party would be smarter to avoid a female presidential candidate in 2020 — a notion offensive to many in the party.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is ridiculous, said Jess McIntosh, a Democratic strategist who worked on Clinton's campaign. We never look at loss by a man and say, 'I guess we shouldn't take another gamble on another white man' or 'I guess we should not have another veteran.' \\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's a particular oddity to the comparison between Warren and Clinton because the two women, aside from sharing a gender and being similar in age, have different life stories and views on issues.\\n\\nWarren graduated from the University of Houston, an institution she refers to as a commuter college, and Rutgers Law School — not the typical path to the elite. Clinton graduated from Wellesley College before heading to Yale Law School.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren called out Clinton by name in her 2003 book, The Two-Income Trap, suggesting that the New York senator sided with big financial institutions during a seminal fight over bankruptcy legislation because she was beholden to the financial-services industry. She did not endorse Clinton for president until June 2016, when Clinton was already the presumptive Democratic nominee.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther women considering presidential campaigns are similarly distinct from Clinton.\\n\\nThree Democratic senators mulling a run — Kamala D. Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York — are in their 50s, putting them a generation behind Clinton and Warren.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnlike Clinton, raised in Illinois before moving to Arkansas with her husband, Harris made a career in California and projects a distinctly West Coast sensibility. Klobuchar offers a Midwestern vibe.\\n\\nThat has not stopped the comparisons. Gillibrand — who took Clinton's seat in the Senate when the former first lady was named President Barack Obama's secretary of state — has been labeled by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro as a sort of Hillary Clinton mini-me.\\n\\nIn Warren's initial days as a presidential candidate, she seemed to go out of her way to push back on the likability question. On the evening of her announcement, she cracked open a bottle of beer in her kitchen, broadcasting the moment live via social media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Wednesday, en route to an appearance on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, she openly mocked the concept.\\n\\nI hear female candidates are most likable in the quiet car! she tweeted, with a video of herself and her husband on a train, and then promoted her upcoming appearance.\\n\\nOne change since Clinton's defeat that may simplify strategies for female candidates is the #MeToo movement, which created a heightened awareness about the shifting standards that women can face. That may have contributed to a growing willingness of 2018 candidates to call out what they see as sexist — and even racist — expectations.\\n\\nDuring her congressional campaign in Massachusetts, Rep. Ayanna Pressley openly talked about the biases she faced as a black woman.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'll tell you the truth. As a woman of color who has a platform, I have been asked to not come off as outraged or angry for fear of being labeled an angry black woman, Pressley said in a speech she delivered amid the battle over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh, who was accused of assaulting a woman when they were teenagers in suburban Maryland. Well, I am angry. And I am outraged. Because this is outrageous.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe midterm elections also were powered by female voters and activists, many of them animated by similar sentiments. That contributed to the Democratic House takeover that returned Pelosi to the speakership, which is seen by potential presidential candidates as a force in their favor.\\n\\nThe notion that all women are the same and that women should be judged on anything other than their own merit is just offensive and wrong, Gillibrand said. Women proved in 2018 that Democrats could win back the House majority powered by extraordinary female candidates and a women-led grass-roots movement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe disparagement of female candidates, and comparisons to Clinton, extended beyond Pressley's race.\\n\\nAs Gretchen Whitner campaigned for governor of Michigan, a state that Clinton narrowly lost, Whitmer had to battle the idea that the state would reject another female candidate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere was some of that 2016 hangover, early on, said Brandon Dillon, the chairman of Michigan's Democratic Party. There were some folks who didn't think that having a female candidate at the top of ticket was going to be a good thing.\\n\\nWhen Clinton endorsed Whitmer in the final week of the campaign, the Republican National Committee snarked that nobody knows how to win Michigan better than Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhitmer won overwhelmingly, defeating Republican Bill Schuette by about 10 percentage points.\\n\\nIn Iowa, Republicans worked to tie a number of female candidates to Clinton and Pelosi, said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Polk County Democratic Party.\\n\\nThat rattled some Democrats, who were deeply aware that their state had never elected a woman from their party to Congress, he said. But the victories of Cindy Axne and Abby Finkenauer — two women who beat Republican incumbents in House contests in the fall, convinced many activists that any curse was broken, Bagniewski said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVoters have long had higher standards for women seeking executive positions, rather than legislative. Winning one, however, seems to smooth the path for future victories, experts say.\\n\\nThere also might be strength in numbers for the upcoming crop of female presidential candidates. Not all of them can be unlikable, said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Clinton's communications director in 2016.\\n\\nIf it continues to happen to the other female candidates, it will be more obvious that there are gender biases at work, Palmieri said. You can have legitimate reasons for why you don't support a Warren candidacy. You have to hope that people look deeper when it's something intangible, like something like likability.\\n\\nFormer Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell is among the Democrats who reject the idea that the party should be shy about nominating a female candidate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere will be hell to pay if there is not a woman on the ticket, at least, Rendell said. He spoke positively about Klobuchar, albeit in terms few would use for a male candidate in the same circumstances.\\n\\nShe's tough as anyone, and yet she appears to be the girl next door, Rendell said. The person every father would like their son to meet and maybe marry.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, as Warren greeted lawmakers in Boston on the opening of the commonwealth's legislative session, there was chatter about her chances.\\n\\nThe only comment I keep hearing about Elizabeth is: Is she electable? Can she win? said state Sen. David Linsky (D). Or does she have some of the same issues that took Hillary Clinton down in terms of likability?"}
{"original": "I can't say for sure that they're wrong. There are no certainties here, and no way to account for every variable that could affect the outcome of the election, let alone events that we can't foresee.\\n\\nBut what we ought to realize is that both Sanders and Biden represent a huge risk to the Democrats — but for completely different reasons.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo simplify things a bit, I fear that Sanders would do everything right and fall short because he was fated to lose, while I fear that Biden would do everything wrong and blow a race he could have won.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLet's start with Biden. His victory in South Carolina does not change the fundamental fact that he is simply terrible at running for president — even worse than in his disastrous runs in 1988 and 2008. Those who are on the campaign trail will tell you that he is showing his age — he starts sentences then can't find his way out of them, he's surly when challenged, and he says cringeworthy things on a daily basis. His debate performances have ranged from barely acceptable to abysmal.\\n\\nSo how much confidence do you have that Biden wouldn't find a way to screw this up?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOpinion Who could win the Democratic primary? Use the Post Opinions Simulator to pick a state and see what might happen in upcoming primaries and caucuses.\\n\\nIt's possible that he can win over voters in the middle who are tired of Trump and that Biden offers the reassurance of an old white guy who talks a lot about how we can all get along if we just wind the clock back four years and pretend Trump never happened. But it's also possible, if not likely, that Biden will prove to be an uninspiring candidate of the kind Democrats have ridden to defeat so many times before, one who will lose more votes through the deadening of turnout than he'll win by converting Republicans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYes, he's getting support from African American voters — so far, anyway — but they already vote at relatively high rates, comparable to white voters. The big untapped potential for Democrats lies in young people and Latinos, neither of whom seems particularly jazzed about a Biden nomination.\\n\\nDespite Biden's insistence that he'll beat Trump like a drum, it isn't hard to imagine Trump gutting him like a fish. Republicans in Congress are already ramping their investigation of Hunter Biden back up, and you can bet they'll use that story to cast a pall over Joe Biden as corrupt or just vaguely untrustworthy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd Biden's history on issues like criminal justice and Social Security gives Trump ample ammunition to run against him from the left, a demobilization strategy designed not to convince anyone that Trump is better on those issues but to make Democrats withdraw in disgust and decide not to vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd what about Sanders? He could be just as problematic a nominee.\\n\\nThe first reason is the obvious one: He's farther to the left than any nominee we've had in pretty much forever. There's a good potential that his views on policy — especially when run through the ringer of an unsympathetic media and a highly motivated opposition — will come to seem dangerous, even frightening. I might be sympathetic to most (though not all) of his proposals, but there's no denying that he proposes radical change.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDepending on what happens with the coronavirus, to many voters the status quo, particularly the economic status quo, may seem pretty good, and even if they don't like Trump, they'll take him over a future that they've come to find unsettling. You can see that in the many stories emerging about disgruntled Republicans and independents saying they'll vote for a Democrat — unless it's Sanders. Right now those are just anecdotes, but they could begin to pile up into something more threatening to his prospects.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSanders says he'll solve all these problems with an unprecedented turnout wave, particularly among those young voters. But so far there isn't much to suggest it's happening. Turnout in the primaries has been reasonably strong, but not unprecedented — and not all benefiting him. The fact that many politically involved young people are excited about Bernie Sanders does not necessarily mean that huge numbers of young people who aren't politically involved will inevitably become excited about Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nThat's not the only reason to be skeptical. While Sanders might not depress Democratic turnout in the way some other candidate might, his ability to bring significant numbers of new voters in — without simultaneously motivating higher turnout among Republicans that would cancel it out — is for the moment a proposition without evidence to back it up.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUp until now, general election trial heats have shown both Sanders and Biden beating Trump pretty much every time. But we should never assume that what people think of the eventual nominee now tells us much about what they'll think of him in October, once the full power of Trump's disinformation machine is aimed at him, not to mention a news media that is likely to repeat the But Her Emails debacle of 2016.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou might find one of these two stories more persuasive than the other; chances are it's the one that matches up with the preference you already have for one or the other candidate. But the fact is that neither of the two men with the best chance of being the Democratic nominee looks like a strong general election candidate.\\n\\nSorry if that fills you with dread; that's certainly how I feel. But it's the truth."}
{"original": "At first, it seemed like the stomach flu. Weeks before his 24th birthday in May 2015, Alec Raeshawn Smith was overcome by troubling symptoms. His body ached, his stomach hurt and he wasn't sleeping well. Laine Lu, a co-worker at his restaurant job, urged him to see a doctor. This is not normal, she recalls telling him. Go get checked out. His mother, Nicole Smith-Holt, worried too. He called her when he decided to go to a health clinic near Minneapolis. He said, Seriously, Mom, I think something is really wrong with me.\\n\\nListen to this and other great stories from The Washington Post Magazine on the Curio app.\\n\\nThe diagnosis was surprising: Type 1 diabetes. Alec's blood sugar levels were nearly twice the healthy limit. His family didn't have a history of diabetes, and lanky, 6-foot-3 Alec looked like the picture of health. At 23, he seemed too old for Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes because it often strikes children. But as Alec discovered, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune response that can appear at any age. It is not preventable, and there is no known cure.\\n\\n(Edmon de Haro for The Washington Post)\\n\\nAt the clinic, a nurse practitioner discussed the potential complications of the chronic disease, including blindness, nerve damage, and kidney and heart problems, according to medical records. Alec came home with prescriptions for two kinds of insulin: One was long-acting; the other gave him short bursts before meals. He wrote on Facebook: Today a lot has changed. … I would never wish this upon anybody. So whoever reads this take care of yourself.\\n\\nEven for his older sister, Brittany Smith, who is a nurse, the learning curve about Type 1 diabetes was steep. I didn't really have a handle on it, she says. Most of her diabetic patients had the far more common Type 2. Both types involve an imbalance of insulin, a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels. For Type 1 diabetics, the body produces little to no insulin. In Type 2, generally, the body has become resistant to insulin's effects. Not all Type 2 diabetics take insulin, but all Type 1 diabetics do. Alec would need a steady supply for the rest of his life.\\n\\nWhat had been a carefree 20-something existence was now dominated by insulin injections, timing of doses and taking a blood sample four times a day to measure glucose levels. I know he'd get frustrated, Nicole says. Within three months, though, Alec had gotten his blood sugar under control. He maintained healthy levels as that first year wore on. He began dating Laine and worked as a manager at the restaurant where they'd met. Eventually, he moved out of his parents' home and into his own apartment on a tree-lined street near downtown Minneapolis.\\n\\nIn 2017, as his 26th birthday neared, his mother had a new worry: He would no longer be covered by her health insurance through her job in the financial aid department of a community college. Nicole paid about $100 per biweekly paycheck for a family plan, and it had not cost extra to include Alec. With it, she says, he initially had been paying about $200 to $300 a month out-of-pocket for his diabetic supplies and prescriptions, an amount he could just afford. The restaurant did not offer insurance, and his $35,000 salary put him above the income limit for Medicaid in Minnesota.\\n\\nHis mother helped him look for a health plan on the marketplace set up by the Affordable Care Act, but his options were expensive. To keep going to the same doctors, she says, he was looking at paying about $450 monthly, in addition to a high deductible of more than $7,000, which would mean months of paying out-of-pocket for most of his medical care. He opted to go without insurance, forgoing that expense to focus on paying for his insulin and supplies until he could find a better option.\\n\\nWhat Alec soon learned was just how much his insulin would end up costing: more than $1,000 a month. The price of insulin — once modest — has skyrocketed in recent years, making the lifesaving medication a significant, even burdensome, expense, especially for the uninsured and underinsured. The costs are so heavy that they have driven some patients to ration their supplies of the drug in a dangerous gamble with life-threatening consequences.\\n\\nAt the time Alec discussed skipping insurance coverage, he told his mother, It can't be that bad. Within a month of going off her policy, he would be dead.\\n\\nLaine Lu, Alec Raeshawn Smith's girlfriend, had looked for prescription discounts for him; she eventually would find him dead in his apartment.

Erick Borrome shows a photo of his best friend. (Photos by Caroline Yang for The Washington Post)\\n\\nInsulin, in its various manufactured forms, has been used to treat diabetes for almost a century, since Canadian researchers isolated the hormone in a lab in 1921. Before their discovery, what we now know as Type 1 diabetes was fatal. Even after being put on starvation diets, patients often lived no more than a few years. The researchers who transformed diabetes treatment won the Nobel Prize, and they sold their patent to the University of Toronto for a total of $3. Above all, these were discoverers who were trying to do a great humanitarian thing, and they hoped their discovery was a kind of gift to humanity, historian Michael Bliss told The Washington Post in 2016.\\n\\nSoon, though, insulin became a commercial enterprise. By 1923, the American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly was manufacturing enough insulin for diabetics across North America. For decades, manufacturers improved formulas, first using animal parts, then producing human insulin using bacteria and recombinant DNA. The 1990s saw the advent of insulin analogs, synthetic drugs made to better mimic the body's own insulin production.\\n\\nToday, critics argue that the price of insulin has far outpaced any innovations. In the past decade alone, U.S. insulin list prices have tripled, according to an analysis of data from IBM Watson Health. In 1996, when Eli Lilly debuted its Humalog brand of insulin, the list price of a 10-milliliter vial was $21. The price of the same vial is now $275. Those costs can be compounded by the multiple vials that diabetics may require to survive each month. It's a very big problem, says Robert Gabbay, chief medical officer at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. It's a tragic barrier to care.\\n\\nThe global insulin market is dominated by three companies: Eli Lilly, the French company Sanofi and the Danish firm Novo Nordisk. All three have raised list prices to similar levels. According to IBM Watson Health data, Sanofi's popular insulin brand Lantus was $35 a vial when it was introduced in 2001; it's now $270. Novo Nordisk's Novolog was priced at $40 in 2001, and as of July 2018, it's $289.\\n\\nIn Washington, the soaring price of insulin has provoked bipartisan concern. Members of Congress are trying to parse the factors that have caused the spike. In November, a congressional caucus released a report on insulin, urging legislation aimed at lowering prices through increased competition and pricing transparency, among other recommendations. In June, the American Medical Association called on the government to monitor insulin pricing and market competition and take enforcement actions as appropriate. Insulin, in some ways, serves as a proxy for the rising prices across the U.S. prescription drug market. On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump railed against high drug prices, and his administration has vowed to lower them, releasing a flurry of proposals in the past year.\\n\\nIn the meantime, a portion of the more than 7 million diabetic Americans who take insulin are stuck with debilitating costs. Though most don't pay the full list price for insulin because of insurance coverage and other rebates, some do, especially those who are uninsured, underinsured or facing a coverage gap through Medicare. The most vulnerable patients are subsidizing the system, William Cefalu, the chief scientific, medical and mission officer of the American Diabetes Association, told a Senate committee in May.\\n\\nPeople should not have to pay significant high prices for accessing a treatment that keeps them well, says economist Rena Conti.\\n\\nAt the same hearing, a father from Maine told senators that a 90-day prescription for just one of his son's insulins would cost him $1,489.46. That's with his high-deductible insurance. He testified that he has taken to buying the same three-month supply from a Canadian pharmacy for about $300 plus $50 in shipping. (It's technically illegal to import medication from other countries, but the Food and Drug Administration generally doesn't prosecute individuals if it's a short-term supply for personal use.) He is not alone in his dilemma: The website GoFundMe has thousands of posts with people pleading for help to pay for insulin.\\n\\nPatients who struggle to afford insulin sometimes ration their supply to make it last longer — a dangerous practice that can create disabling or deadly complications. It's very shortsighted to skimp on insulin, says Kasia Lipska, an endocrinologist and diabetes researcher at Yale School of Medicine. In the long term, it's going to cost us much more. Poor glycemic control can lead to blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart disease and stroke. In the short term, patients who stop taking enough insulin can lapse into diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition where blood sugars get too high and the body's blood becomes acidic. It can become fatal in just hours or a few days.\\n\\nAt the Yale Diabetes Center, Lipska and her colleagues recently found that one in four diabetic patients reported rationing insulin because of the cost. Very few of those patients were uninsured, but their out-of-pocket expenses still created a financial burden. These patients were also, not surprisingly, almost three times as likely to have poor blood sugar control as patients who didn't underuse insulin.\\n\\nAlec's mother, Nicole Smith-Holt. Under her insurance, he initially had been paying about $200 to $300 a month for his supplies and prescriptions. Without insurance, he would pay more than $1,000 a month for insulin. (Caroline Yang for The Washington Post)\\n\\nDid Alec die because he was rationing? The answer may never be absolutely clear, but his family is convinced that he was skimping on his doses. He never told his loved ones that he was rationing because of the expense, but they knew that the disease and its cost wore on him. He had talked to his parents about searching for jobs that offered health insurance. Laine had scouted the Internet for prescription discounts. Alec vented to his best friend, Erick Borrome, whose wife, Arizbeth, offered to get him cheap insulin from a pharmacy in Mexico, where she had family and a vial cost roughly $50. She says: We had many conversations about the insulin and the cost. He was pretty worried about it. But, she adds, he was too shy to accept help. He never took her up on the offer.\\n\\nNicole got the call that Alec had died on a Tuesday. It was Laine who found him. She hadn't heard from him since Sunday night, so she went to his apartment to check on him. He was on the floor beside his bed. I grabbed his shoulder, and it was ice cold, Laine says. I just knew he was gone.\\n\\nAlec's funeral was held the day after the Fourth of July, his favorite holiday. Family and friends gathered at his parents' house in Richfield, a Minneapolis suburb, to shoot off fireworks in his memory. Those first few weeks were a blur, as Nicole tried in her grief to piece together the last days of Alec's life. The medical examiner had listed diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as the cause of death. By definition, he had died of a lack of insulin, but why and how did that happen?\\n\\nIn speaking with Laine, Nicole learned that Alec had indicated he was running low on insulin before he died. That Sunday, Laine had suggested they go to a food truck festival, but she remembered Alec saying, No, I don't think I have enough insulin for that. That night, he was tired and complaining about abdominal pains. Hearing this, Nicole deduced that those symptoms may have been warning signs of DKA.\\n\\nThere were more clues: There was some healthy food in his fridge, but no stockpile of insulin. As Nicole cleaned out his cluttered blue car, littered with old prescription receipts, she started to cobble together just how much his insulin and blood sugar testing supplies cost without insurance or discounts. The total, by her count, was nearly $1,300 per month. That was roughly the same amount that Alec's local pharmacy tallied for me nearly a year later, using a list of his medications and medical supplies. It's very expensive to be diabetic without insurance, the pharmacist said. That $1,300 was almost $200 more than Alec's biweekly paycheck.\\n\\nNicole now believes that Alec was rationing his insulin because of the cost. Based upon what he had left when he was found, we came to the conclusion that he had not filled his prescription, so he had to have been rationing for a short period of time, Nicole told me. We realized that he had been taking less insulin and less often than he should, trying to make it stretch until he got his next paycheck. He was found dead three days before payday.\\n\\nNo one can truly know what happened in those final days. Alec may not have realized that his condition was so serious, or perhaps he thought he would be fine, just as he had been when he was diagnosed. DKA creates confusion as it progresses, and it can progress quickly, shutting down vital organs.\\n\\nIf I could go back in time, Nicole says, I would have found a way for him to not move out … so I could monitor this or see that he was struggling in some kind of way, and force him to take our help. One afternoon, sitting at their dining room table, her husband, James Holt, recalled encouraging Alec to get his own place. I think back and regret that, he said, wiping away tears.\\n\\nIn their search for answers, there was enough blame to go around. His family blamed the broken health-care system. They blamed unaffordable insurance and high out-of-pocket costs. They blamed a lot of things, including, in darker moments, themselves. But they kept coming back to the price of insulin. Why was a treatment that had been around for nearly 100 years so expensive? And what could be done about it?\\n\\n(Edmon de Haro for The Washington Post)\\n\\nNicole hadn't known much about the world of diabetes advocacy before Alec died. But now she felt a budding activism as she encountered a flood of information and stories like her own online.\\n\\nAdvocates were rallying around the hashtag #insulin4all, which the nonprofit organization T1International helped create in 2014 to raise awareness about the inaccessibility of insulin, particularly in developing countries. T1International's founder, Elizabeth Pfiester, an American Type 1 diabetic who now lives in the United Kingdom, still marvels at how much more affordable diabetes care is in her adopted country. It's really a shame that #insulin4all is needed as a rallying cry in the U.S., she says.\\n\\nThere are T1International activists like Hattie Saltzman, a college student in Missouri who went a year without buying insulin because she couldn't afford her monthly $550 insulin bill. Her father shared some of his insulin, and she got free samples from her doctor. At one point, she told me, I had rationed insulin so extensively that it expired. I didn't catch that until I went to the ER because my blood sugars were through the roof. When the diabetic daughter of family friends died of cystic fibrosis, the family donated her leftover insulin to Saltzman. That got her through the year until she qualified for better insurance coverage.\\n\\nThere are new cases all the time. In July, Long Island resident Doreen Rudolph tweeted about her young adult daughter's struggle to afford insulin: I just bought 2 vials of insulin for my daughter cost me $524. With a discount card. All I could buy. I left the pharmacy and sat in my car and cried. Her message struck a chord: Within five days, her tweet had been liked 70,000 times, and her $8,000 GoFundMe campaign was fully funded. To buy insulin, Rudolph told me, We've taken out loans. We've borrowed from retirement. You think, 'Where else can I get it?' \\n\\nA pharmacist and a number of physicians told me about older insulins available from Walmart. The type of insulin first came out in the 1980s and now costs about $25 per vial. So-called Walmart insulin is a controversial solution for Type 1 diabetics, many of whom believe that older formulas are more likely to lead to dangerously low blood sugar levels. A few doctors echoed that concern. Yet it could still save lives. It's very good insulin, one physician told me. Another said, It's obviously better than nothing. Researchers have found that these older insulins work just as well for Type 2 diabetics as pricier analog insulins, but some research shows a slightly better outcome for Type 1 diabetics on newer formulas.\\n\\nMany diabetics continue to hunt for coupons and discounts on high-priced insulins. Some doctors will give out samples to struggling patients. The constant search for more insulin can become all-consuming. I think about it when I wake up. I think about it when I go to bed, says Michelle Fenner, an #insulin4all activist whose diabetic son is 17. She worries about what will happen when he is a young adult and on his own. There is no way he can pay what I do, she says.\\n\\nEli Lilly, which hasn't raised its insulin prices since May 2017, declines to discuss its pricing strategies in general. Asked for comment, it offered a statement: Some people pay too much for insulin at the pharmacy, and there are several reasons — including high deductible insurance plans that require people to pay thousands of dollars in medical bills before coverage is triggered. We're focused on finding solutions to the problem.\\n\\nIn August, the company started the Lilly Diabetes Solution Center, a help line to assist people who need help paying for their insulin. Fenner said a coupon she received from the help line dropped the monthly cost of one of her son's insulins from $900 to $95. It's an incredible boon, but she already worries how long Eli Lilly will keep the savings going. According to the American Diabetes Association, these kinds of measures are just a stopgap: The organization's June 2018 report concluded that corporate patient assistance programs are not deemed to be a long-term or comprehensive answer to the rising cost of insulin for the vast majority of people with diabetes. Several people, including Fenner, described insulin as being like oxygen: Scavenging for it invokes a primal fear, like the gasp you make just before you run out of air.\\n\\nAlec's sisters Brittany Smith, left, and Alexis Holt look at old family photos.

(Photos by Caroline Yang for The Washington Post)\\n\\nIn early May, 10 months after Alec died, Nicole flew to Indianapolis to attend a shareholder meeting at Eli Lilly headquarters. Her trip had been coordinated in part by T1International. Before the meeting, a small band of activists gathered outside. One held a neon-pink poster that read: Your insulin is a life saver. Your prices are poison.\\n\\nCamera crews set up on a street corner. For more than half an hour, Nicole answered the same questions from reporters. Why are you here? What do you want from Eli Lilly? She told them she was there for Alec. I feel like I am leaving a legacy for him, she said. That's what is really important to me. I don't want any other person to die the way that he did. If I can prevent it, that's what I'm here to do.\\n\\nNicole wanted pharmaceutical companies to start by being more transparent about their prices — to disclose how much it costs to manufacture a vial of insulin and what the profit margin on each vial is. Ultimately, she wanted them to reduce the price. They're going to tell you it's complicated or they can't share that information with you, she said to a reporter. It's not all that complicated. They're choosing to make it complicated. It's just plain greed.\\n\\nThe rising prices from Eli Lilly, Sanofi and Novo Nordisk have raised suspicions. The companies appear to have increased them in lockstep over a number of years, prompting allegations of price fixing. All three companies denied these charges when I contacted them. (In 2010, Mexico fined Eli Lilly and three Mexican companies for price collusion on insulin, an allegation Eli Lilly also denied.) In the United States, a federal prosecutor and at least five state attorneys general are currently investigating the companies' pricing practices, according to Kaiser Health News. In October, Minnesota became the first state to sue the companies over insulin prices. And in January 2017, potential class-action lawsuits alleging price fixing by the three companies began making their way through the courts on behalf of diabetics. The companies denied the suits' allegations.\\n\\nThere is also another, less known corporate entity in the mix: pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which include Express Scripts, OptumRx and CVS Health; all are now named in lawsuits on high insulin prices, but these companies also deny any wrongdoing. PBMs manage the prescription drug benefits that are part of insurance plans, working with pharmaceutical companies to negotiate discounts on behalf of insurance providers. Every time a PBM extracts a deeper discount, an insulin manufacturer has the incentive to take a price increase to quote 'make themselves whole,'  says Rena Conti, a health economist at Boston University. That's probably one reason why, even as Eli Lilly's list price for Humalog insulin has increased by 175 percent since 2009, the company maintains that its net price — the amount the company earns after rebates, discounts and fees — has remained steady.\\n\\nBoth drug companies and PBMs play a role in escalating drug prices. It's almost like Kabuki theater where one guy points to the other guy and says, 'It's not me, it's him,'  says Jing Luo, an instructor at Harvard Medical School and a faculty member at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital who studies insulin pricing.\\n\\nThese corporate entities are powerful special interests. In 2017, the pharmaceutical and health product industry — which includes drug companies and PBMs — spent nearly $280 million on lobbying, the biggest spender by far of 20 top industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Even some patient advocacy organizations, like the American Diabetes Association, receive millions in funding from pharmaceutical companies. The industry also has a revolving door to government. Alex Azar, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, was the president of Eli Lilly's U.S. division until 2017. Under his watch, the price of the company's analog insulin doubled. Now he is tasked with overseeing the government's plan to lower those same prices.\\n\\nAt Eli Lilly, Nicole met with Mike Mason, the vice president of U.S. Lilly's diabetes division. The company declined to make Mason available for an interview for this article, but Nicole says he seemed compassionate. She held a photo of Alec during the meeting and placed it on the table in front of her while she read a statement. Profits should never come before the lives of people, she told Mason and the other representatives in the room, before asking them to remember her family's grief. She struggled to maintain her composure, she told me later, but when she brought up corporate greed with Mason, she says, I stopped and looked him dead in the face. He looked away.\\n\\nWe've taken out loans. We've borrowed from retirement. You think, 'Where else can I get it?'  says Doreen Rudolph of the struggle to afford insulin for her daughter.\\n\\nOn May 11, four days after Nicole's trip to Eli Lilly, President Trump and Azar stood in the White House Rose Garden to unveil American Patients First, the administration's blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce out-of-pocket costs. The president told the crowd, We will have tougher negotiation, more competition and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter. And it will start to take effect very soon.\\n\\nThe blueprint includes more than 50 proposals. There is not a single silver bullet that's going to reduce drug prices across the board, says Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor and drug-pricing researcher who is a colleague of Luo's at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Some of the proposals are nonstarters, he argues, such as punishing other countries for the low prices they pay on drugs. (Americans pay more for drugs than any other nationality, but the governments of many other developed countries regulate drug prices, which keeps them lower.) A better solution would be to focus on what makes our pharmaceutical market inefficient, Kesselheim says. Focusing on this concept of foreign freeloading is, I think, a political distraction.\\n\\nFor Conti, the Boston University economist, the administration's blueprint doesn't go far enough in addressing insurers. To guarantee that real people pay lower prices at the pharmacy, the first thing she would do is eliminate insurance plans that allow large out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs — including the kind of high-deductible plan that Alec opted not to take. It's insurance principles 101, Conti says. People should not have to pay significant high prices for accessing a treatment that keeps them well.\\n\\nThe blueprint overall is just that: a starting framework. One promising idea calls for increased pricing transparency, a popular idea among insulin-access activists that has also been gaining ground in state legislatures. The blueprint also recommends bringing more generic drugs onto the market. Right now, the United States has two relatively new follow-on insulins, which are similar to generics, but they are only marginally cheaper. Some experts say more competition is needed to lower prices. In December, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a statement on policies that will put more generics on the U.S. market, including for insulin starting in 2020, as part of a transition that was written into the Affordable Care Act. We've heard frequent reports of patients rationing insulin, and in some cases dying because they can't afford the injections they need to survive, the statement read. These tragic stories aren't isolated occurrences. And they're not acceptable for a drug that's nearly a century old.\\n\\nTrump has said that drug companies are getting away with murder, and he has singled them out on Twitter, but some experts say his administration's blueprint takes a harder line on PBMs than it does on pharmaceutical companies. And though Trump pledged in late May that drug manufacturers would lower their prices — and a few voluntarily did so — none lowered the price of insulin. In July, Novo Nordisk raised its list prices on two insulins another 5 percent.\\n\\nAlec's family, from left: Alexis Holt, James Holt, Nicole Smith-Holt, Brittany Smith and Jamisen Holt at their home in Richfield, Minn. Nicole Smith-Holt is working to get drug manufacturers to lower the price of insulin. (Caroline Yang for The Washington Post)\\n\\nMay through July would bring some of the hardest days, but Nicole and James pressed on, hosting a rally for affordable insulin at the Minnesota state Capitol. Their story reached the ears of lawmakers: In the state legislature, the Alec Smith Emergency Insulin Act was introduced to provide insulin to those in need. It didn't come up for a vote, but they laminated a copy of the bill's text anyway.\\n\\nOn her first Mother's Day without Alec, Nicole spent hours planting a memorial garden in a corner of her yard. A week later, on May 20, the family invited loved ones over to visit the space and commemorate Alec's first heavenly birthday. Brittany had driven a half-hour across the Wisconsin state line to buy fireworks. In the kitchen, there were hamburgers and hot dogs waiting. There was even a cake: store-bought with thick white frosting — the kind a diabetic might be told to avoid. In green letters, it read: Forever 26.\\n\\nThe long Minnesota winter had given way to one of those perfect days, 70 degrees and sunny. James fired up the grill, and music piped through speakers. The Borromes arrived, and so did Laine, who dabbed her eyes with a napkin as they shared stories about Alec.\\n\\nFor Nicole, it was too much at times. When she needed to, she retreated from the 40 people gathered and smoked a Newport alone on the deck. When James escorted a group of Alec's friends over to the garden, where they sprinkled some of Alec's ashes, Nicole backed away from the huddle, saying, I can't do this. Some days, she told me later, it's all a lot.\\n\\nAlec would continue to be the face of a growing movement. In a few weeks, a letter from Nicole would be read at a conference in Washington about making prescription medicine affordable. In June, during a hearing on rising drug prices with Azar, Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota would invoke Nicole: Her son Alec passed away last year because he couldn't afford his insulin, she told Azar. Later in the summer, Democratic senators would invite the family to Washington to share their story.\\n\\nThere would be plenty of time for more activism, but today was meant for those who knew Alec best. At dusk, Brittany handed out sparklers and Roman candles, and the crowd gathered in a circle on the grass. They launched the fireworks into big bursts of yellow and green, with sparks and ash raining down over the yard. It had been a hard day, but it was still a party. Nicole stood on the deck to record the scene on a cellphone as friends and family called out: Happy birthday, Alec! We love you! We miss you. Everyone stared up at the sky, watching until the last flare burned out.\\n\\nTiffany Stanley is a writer in Washington."}
{"original": "Virginia recently registered the highest infection rate ever in its state correctional facilities, but Northam continues to sit on his hands. Despite his leadership in addressing coronavirus challenges and his support of criminal justice reform, he has failed to use the power of clemency inherent in his office to make early prison releases possible, instead condemning inmates, staff and prison towns to unnecessary exposure.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGovernors, like the president, have the power to pardon and commute prison terms. Presidential clemency has fallen on hard times as President Trump wields it largely to benefit those with personal connections. He has proved even more miserly than his predecessors with clemency even though the coronavirus is ravaging federal prisons around the country. But the president is not the only one who appears to lack courage, compassion or interest. Governors, with a total prison population of about 1.2 million, have together released only a few hundred men and women early. Yet it is upon them to save people in their states' prisons from infection and death. As a side benefit, they may also save the pardon power.\\n\\nThe coronavirus has besieged state prisons around the country. Unsanitary and crowded conditions, which render social distancing aspirational only, threaten the health of men and women who often suffer from underlying health conditions. A rapidly aging prison population made prisons ripe for the virus. It is no surprise that Virginia's prison facility for the elderly and sick witnessed the highest number of deaths.\\n\\nPrisons are not self-contained units. Prisoner transfers and releases spread the virus. Corrections staff carry it between the inside and outside. Especially, large prisons drove up local infection rates over the summer, as a recent Prison Policy Initiative report indicates. But now the virus is spreading much faster and more widely. Deaths of people in prison rarely make the news. The body count piles up but hardly registers with the public — or apparently in governors' offices.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith the exception of a handful of commutations, the silence from governors' mansions around the country has been deafening. This may not surprise in states where governors derided the coronavirus and took little action. Northam, however, acted early and decisively. Still, neither his physician background nor his racial justice commitment appears to include prison inmates.\\n\\nVirginia's conditional pardons allow for early releases from prisons. Northam could advance the release date of all inmates who are to be released within the next six, nine or 12 months. He could target inmates older than 60 who have served at least two-thirds of their sentences or 25 years in case of life sentences. He could at least provide speedy release to those with debilitating illnesses or preexisting conditions. He could mandate electronic monitoring or grant extensive furloughs that would allow a reassessment of these releases once the pandemic is over.\\n\\nThe governor had the summer months to plan for such releases, as health experts long predicted a second spike. With the opportunity for creating a thoughtful and regularized process squandered, clemency now would not be perfect. Yet it would fulfill the core function implicit in the term clemency, with the state providing mercy at a moment of national crisis.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEarly releases will require investment in Medicaid, probation officers, housing and perhaps electronic monitoring. Yet, those costs would still be less than the state's more than $20,000 annual expense per inmate.\\n\\nNortham still has a long, dark winter to make good on his commitment to racial justice and criminal justice reform. The prospect of widespread vaccination by late spring is no excuse for inaction. With coronavirus-related deaths projected to double by April 1 in Virginia, there will be widespread suffering among inmates and staff. Northam could lessen the pain. With African Americans dramatically overrepresented in Virginia's prisons, the governor's use of clemency would be a powerful sign that he is serious about racial equality and fulfilling our joint humanity.\\n\\nIn addition to saving lives and signaling the value of all people independent of their criminal record, the governor may also be able to set a powerful national signal for an effective and appropriate use of executive mercy. As Trump uses his clemency to benefit friends with claims of questionable merit, the governors could provide the blueprint on how to reinvigorate the pardon power. Northam could take the lead. The service to the state and the country would be immeasurable.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "During the holiday season, Trump also managed to fit in at least five rounds of golf and scores of false tweets about the results of the 2020 election.\\n\\nOnce Trump returned to Washington, his schedule remained in vacation mode. The disclaimer was revised slightly: President Trump will work from early in the morning until late in the evening. He will make many calls and have many meetings. But the density of scheduled events remained consistent at or near zero.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn fact, this has been Trump's schedule essentially since dawn on Nov. 4 of last year. After polls closed the day prior and after Trump appeared before reporters in the middle of the night to declare victory, his daily schedules quickly became ghost towns. Of the 64 days since Nov. 4, the White House has listed scheduled events on only 27 of them.\\n\\nIt is by far the emptiest his calendar has been since he took office. There have been other periods in which Trump has had no scheduled public events on his calendar, but those usually overlapped with holiday periods or the weekends. This doesn't mean he doesn't do anything, as those disclaimers want you to understand. But it doesn't exactly suggest a president who's engaged with his formal responsibilities to the fullest possible extent.\\n\\n(The busy end-of-year activity in 2018 and 2019 was centered on the government shutdown and his efforts to pressure Congress into approving funding for a wall on the border with Mexico.)\\n\\nIf we look at this only on a monthly basis, the past three months are remarkable. The percentage of days in each month where Trump has nothing on his schedule has soared as the number of actual events — including things like rounds of golf — has dropped.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that while this lull overlapped with the holiday period, it has not been limited to times at which he was hunkered down in one of his privately owned properties. Of the 292 days on which his calendar has been blank, 165 of them have been days he has visited one of his properties. Since Nov. 4, 24 days without scheduled events have been while he has been based in Washington and didn't head to his golf course in Virginia.\\n\\nWhat has Trump been doing? He's been tweeting a lot. He has pardoned a slew of political allies swept up in the Russia investigation and granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom to several athletes and to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), one of the few legislators willing to uncritically amplify and bolster Trump's rhetoric about the Russia probe. So he has kept busy, but generally while aimed at things unrelated to the governance of the country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNothing, though, has occupied his time like his obsession about somehow undoing the election that will return him to the private sector. The majority of his tweets over the past two months have centered on election-related conspiracy theories that he has invented or picked up from cable news and various right-wing voices in the media. He has tweeted a lot about what he sees on television, as he usually does, and has clearly spent an inordinate amount of time huddling with lawyers and allies to figure out what new spaghetti to throw at the wall.\\n\\nIt hardly bears mentioning outside the White House complex, but this is going on as the novel coronavirus claims thousands of lives a day and as states struggle with distribution of the vaccine, which bears nearly the entire load of Trump's efforts to halt the virus's spread.\\n\\nWhat remains unclear in the abstract is why Trump wants a second term in office anyway. He enjoys the trappings of the job, sure, and the power. But he never bothered actually articulating a platform of policy goals during the 2020 election, even when pressed by friendly reporters to do so. That he has the position now and isn't actually doing anything with it lends credence to the idea that his motivations for trying to overturn his loss are rooted more in his own vanity and possible legal concerns than much else.\\n\\nIt doesn't really matter. The die is cast: Trump will be out of office in just over two weeks. It's likely that his typical day-to-day activity won't change much when that happens: tweeting complaints and golfing at his own properties."}
{"original": "The issue has been hotly debated. Officials received more than 15,000 comments on the proposed rule after it was issued last January. The rule was finalized last month and goes into effect Jan. 11.\\n\\nFederal officials have said the goal is to ensure safe and accessible travel. Others say they hope the change will bring order to a situation that threatened to undermine the credibility of those traveling with legitimate service animals.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation now defines a service animal as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.\\n\\nThe new rules limit the number of service animals a person may travel with to two and require individuals to file paperwork detailing their animal's behavior, training and health status before they fly.\\n\\nAmerican Airlines, which outlined its new policy Tuesday, said it will stop accepting emotional support animals Feb. 1. Animals that previously traveled as emotional support animals may still accompany passengers as carry-on or cargo pets if they meet requirements, the airline said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAmerican said customers traveling with service animals must complete a special form attesting to the dog's behavior, training and health 48 hours before their flight, unless the reservation is booked within 48 hours. That authorization will be valid for one year or until the expiration of its vaccinations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe're confident this approach will enable us to better serve our customers, particularly those with disabilities who travel with service animals, and better protect our team members at the airport and on the aircraft, Jessica Tyler, American's president of cargo and vice president of airport excellence, said in a statement accompanying the new policy.\\n\\nOfficials at Alaska Airlines announced similar changes last week. The airline said it will continue to accept emotional support animals for reservations made before Jan. 11 for travel through Feb. 28. After that, emotional support animals no longer will be permitted.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis regulatory change is welcome news, as it will help us reduce disturbances onboard while continuing to accommodate our guests traveling with qualified service animals, said Ray Prentice, Alaska Airlines' director of customer advocacy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther airlines, including Delta and Southwest, said they are in the process of updating their policies but welcome the changes.\\n\\nThis rule will allow airlines to put safety first for all of our customers and employees, while protecting the rights of customers who have disabilities and need to travel with trained service animals, said Adrian Gee, a Delta Air Lines spokesman. We are currently reviewing the new rule and will continue to work with Delta's Advisory Board on Disability to implement it in a manner that improves the experience for all our customers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the definition of what was considered a service animal expanded to include animals travelers said they needed for emotional and psychological support, there was a sharp increase in the number and variety of creatures in passenger cabins. The rise sometimes fueled conflict among passengers and between passengers and crew members.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere also were reports of animals attacking passengers and crew members, as well as animals defecating in the passenger cabin. Some questioned the legitimacy of such animals because unlike other service animals, many emotional support animals were not trained.\\n\\nThe Transportation Department first tried to define what should be considered a service animals in 2016 through its Advisory Committee on Accessible Air Transportation, but the group was unable to resolve which species should be allowed."}
{"original": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), an on-again, off-again Trump foe who organized a group willing to stand athwart the inevitable during the Jan. 6 certification, received a tweet of approval.\\n\\nThis isn't what Cruz's lawyerly statement actually said, nor is it what he said during the appearance on Fox News that apparently inspired the tweet. Instead, he touted the unprecedented allegations of fraud, most of which stem from Trump. But such nuances are secondary to both parties. Trump got to tout an ally in his fight and Cruz got Trump's approval — even as he preserved the long-term deniability that his comments have been carefully intended to maintain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's hard not to read this specific fight over the election results as being a sort of jury deliberation on Trump's role within Republican politics. The tension between efforts by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to limit Senate objections to the presidential election results and by senators such as Cruz who are eager to appeal to Trump's enthusiastic base has led to various examinations of where the power center of the party will land after Jan. 20.\\n\\nBut this is largely missing the forest for the trees. The story of the Republican Party for at least the past 12 years has been one of tension between a political establishment and a wild fringe. That tension has repeatedly spurred the establishment to try to appease or co-opt the fringe. But instead of folding into the party, the fringe keeps moving further out. That is the tension of the moment: How will a fringe empowered and reinforced by the Trump presidency coexist with a Republican Party eager to move back toward reality?\\n\\nConsider how we got here.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThree things happened in 2008 that shocked the Republican system. The first was that the presidency of George W. Bush was increasingly seen as a failure, even by many Republicans. By early October of that year, his approval among members of his party was under 60 percent in Gallup polling, a staggeringly low figure by recent standards. That was in part due to the downturn that was still burning through the economy, a downturn that destabilized the sense of security of even the most financially stable Americans. Those two things contributed to the election of Barack Obama, a manifestation of another cultural change in the country: the decreasing dominance of Whites.\\n\\nBefore Obama won, though, he was the target of baseless allegations that he had not been born in the United States and, therefore, was ineligible to hold the office of president. This wasn't true, but it was politically potent. The assertion wasn't limited to conservative circles; during his hard-fought Democratic primary victory over Hillary Clinton, even some Democrats elevated the claims. But the claims were heavily centered on right-wing websites that were finding new audiences with the emergence of social media. Rumors that spread over email spread more slowly than ones dropped into Facebook and Twitter (as the founder of Snopes explained to The Washington Post in 2015). Write up a blog post claiming evidence of Obama's ineligibility and tweet it out and suddenly you can propel the misinformation everywhere — and make a decent bit of cash from new visitors to your website.\\n\\nAs the 2008 election approached, it was clear that there was an enormous amount of energy to the political right of the GOP establishment, energy often concentrated in these theories. The party's nominee, John McCain, made one of the first overt efforts to appease those voters, selecting Sarah Palin as his running mate largely on the strength of her credibility with those skeptical of the establishment. His candidacy was doomed, though, and Palin didn't do much to help.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFrom nearly the moment Obama took office, he became a lightning rod for the conservative fringe. Part of it was situational: Inheriting the crumbled economy meant needing to make broad investments to bolster employers and workers. Obama was painted as a socialist for doing so, a charge that itself leveraged a sense from some on the right that he was an other, given his family background and life story.\\n\\nThe tea party movement, which emerged soon after Obama took office, was a manifestation of those overlapping concerns. Ostensibly centered on government spending (and centered on that concern by conservative activists), the movement was also intertwined with concerns about the declining power of White America and immigration.\\n\\nMany Republican candidates recognized the value of appealing to the fervent base of tea party supporters and did so overtly. The movement introduced candidates of its own, often pulled from the mistier fringes of conservative thought. The establishment pushed back hard, working to undercut primary challenges from tea-party-spawned candidates. Sometimes it worked; often it didn't. The energy among Republican voters for candidates espousing hard-line tea party positions propelled several to surprising primary wins — but then to general-election losses, as the establishment had feared.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat energy continued to be powered by conservative media. Fox News leaned into the tea party movement, being described by one research team as a national advocacy organization actively fostering a social protest identity. Further from the political center of the party were sites such as Breitbart, which not only generated enthusiasm for the movement but encouraged speculation about Obama's ancestry.\\n\\nRepublican leaders tried to appease the tea partyers to leverage the energy. A number of policy concessions emerged. The party shifted to the right. But the enthusiasm for the tea party movement was driven heavily by opposition to Obama and a changing America, and the elevation of various policy issues as central concerns was often secondary. Put another way, there was no appeasing those for whom the fight itself was often the desired goal.\\n\\nWhat's often underrecognized about Trump's emergence in national politics is that he was the best-known figure willing to fully immerse himself in those fights encouraged in far-right media. He flirted with a 2012 presidential run by leaning into birtherism, building a foothold with sketchier conservative media outlets by doing so.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis embrace of birtherism didn't prevent an embrace from more-mainstream conservative outlets, though. He first publicly questioned Obama's birthplace in March 2011; at the end of that month, Fox News announced that he would be contributing weekly to its morning flagship program, Fox & Friends. That gig lasted until he announced his presidential candidacy in June 2015.\\n\\nTrump's strategy wasn't complicated. He watched Fox News and read sites such as Breitbart and reiterated the questions and concerns he saw there. When violence in Central America led to a surge of young immigrants at the border with Mexico, Trump echoed conservative media in seizing on immigration as an issue. When several people infected with Ebola traveled to the United States shortly before the 2014 midterm elections, Trump, like Fox News and Breitbart, obsessed over it.\\n\\nWhen Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, he was praised by supporters for his directness and honesty. What that meant, to a large degree, was that he was saying things that they were hearing on Fox News and in far-right media — things that other candidates wouldn't say often because they were believed to be prohibitive when seeking elected office. Trump said Fox things to a Fox audience, and a chunk of the audience coalesced around him once his comments about immigration prompted enough of a cultural fight to break through the noise. This relatively small core was a lot in a crowded primary field, and Trump quickly emerged as the Republican front-runner.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter spending months thinking that Trump's support would collapse and a desperate few weeks in early 2016 trying to ensure that it did, the Republican establishment was forced to work with Trump. Over the course of the 2016 campaign, though, there was a broad assumption that he would lose and the party would need to rebuild.\\n\\nThe establishment had come to a similar conclusion in 2012 when Mitt Romney lost, deciding that, among other things, it needed to expand its base to include more non-White voters, perhaps by moving away from a hard line on immigration. (Even Sean Hannity embraced the idea when the political winds blew in that direction.) But it didn't need to make such a move to win in 2016. Instead, Trump's candidacy reinforced cultural and racial politics far more openly than those of past Republicans, helping stoke the energy of Republican voters. Against an unpopular Democratic opponent that year, his fervent base proved to be large enough in enough states to win him the White House.\\n\\nAgain, that base was powered by far-right media and misinformation. An influential study from Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society found that Breitbart was the most popular media outlet on the political right during the 18 months leading up to the presidential election. A few months before the election, Breitbart and the Trump campaign effectively merged, with the website's chairman, Stephen K. Bannon — who had once described the site as virulently anti-establishment — becoming the chief executive of the campaign itself.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOnce he became president, Trump and the party similarly merged. As with the tea party movement, Trump's focus was never policy but, instead, fringe cultural fights. This suited the establishment fairly well: By letting Trump have his incendiary public persona, the GOP got hundreds of new conservative judges, three Supreme Court justices and a massive tax-cut package. It meant a lot of looking the other way at Trump's behavior and broad refusals to call out dishonesty and controversial comments, but for much of his term, it worked on a political level.\\n\\nAs the 2020 election approached, this alliance held. Trump's repeated attacks on the mail-in voting process and his refusals to say he would concede peacefully should he lose were met with shrugs. The 2018 elections were largely a rout for the Democrats thanks to Trump's unpopularity and, clearly, because many 2016 Trump voters stayed home with him not on the ballot. But being close to Trump wasn't itself necessarily disqualifying in that environment: Trump allies such as Ron DeSantis in Florida and Brian Kemp in Georgia won close gubernatorial races. So even as it seemed clear Trump would lose his reelection bid, most Republicans stuck with him.\\n\\nThen he lost. Trump's (predictable) refusal to acknowledge the loss was at first accepted as a cost of not alienating his base. The sentiment was infamously summarized by an official who spoke with The Post a few days after the loss was confirmed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time? No one seriously thinks the results will change, the senior Republican said. He went golfing this weekend. It's not like he's plotting how to prevent Joe Biden from taking power on Jan. 20. He's tweeting about filing some lawsuits, those lawsuits will fail, then he'll tweet some more about how the election was stolen, and then he'll leave.\\n\\nThis was the operating assumption for much of Trump's presidency: Go along with his nonsense, get what you need where you can and, eventually, things will go back to normal. Some in the establishment saw Trump's loss as a chance to step away from fringe politics, operating under an assumption that those politics are mostly associated with Trump himself.\\n\\nThey are not. The fringe has grown only more robust over the past four years, encouraged by Trump. He's leveraged sycophantic entities such as One America News and Newsmax in an effort to pressure Fox News to move further toward the right, an effort that has borne some fruit. He's refused to clamp down on bizarre conspiracy theories such as QAnon, even at times encouraging them. An expert who spoke with The Post in 2017 noted that Trump's politics are rooted in baseless conspiracy theories, something reinforced by his approach to communications as president. His counternarrative to Russia's interference in the 2016 election? A broad, baseless claim centered on the FBI. His rationalization for losing the election? A conspiracy among his opponents and state officials to prevent a win.\\n\\nSince that Republican official shrugged at the harm of humoring Trump, Trump and the far right have only spiraled farther from the center of the galaxy, like a Voyager probe of nonsense. When Fox News had the gall to accurately report that Trump lost his reelection bid, Trump and his allies rejected the network. Fox News spent years building foot soldiers for the MAGA movement, but, in refusing to accede to his theories, it was quickly rejected by many Republicans.\\n\\nSuffolk University has for years asked Americans what TV news or commentary source they trust most, offering options such as CNN, Fox News, PBS and MSNBC. Fox News consistently earned most-trusted marks simply by holding the majority of Republicans. But in the first Suffolk poll released after the election, Fox News is now running about even with none of the above.\\n\\nMuch of that shift, it is safe to assume, is a function of viewership having moved to One America or Newsmax, places where accuracy is often a secondary concern. Their rhetoric is centered on Trump at the moment, but it is also deeply opportunistic. Once the election fades as a subject of speculation, something else will fill the vacuum.\\n\\nBen Collins, an NBC News reporter who has focused on QAnon and other misinformation efforts, made an observation about conservative media in the post-election period.\\n\\nThe QAnon rumor pipeline has completely eaten the far-right news ecosystem over the last two months, he said in a tweet. He pointed to a debunked claim about voting machines as being little more than a tendril of the sprawling QAnon theory.\\n\\nAnd, he added, the president believes all of it.\\n\\nProbably. There's certainly some opportunism at play for Trump. But the point is that the fringe keeps doing its thing in ways that are often only tangentially linked to Trump. There is some chunk of the Republican base that is now invested enough in this divergent soap opera to turn away from Fox News. QAnon has engaged hundreds of thousands of people in a LARP about government conspiracies, Satanism and child abuse. The fringe was always more invested in cultural fights than political ones, but, encouraged by Trump, those cultural fights are now much further from the GOP establishment than they were even four years ago.\\n\\nThis is the fight the GOP faces. It's not really about whether Cruz's ploy to use lawyer-speak to give Trump a thumbs up will play well in the 2024 primaries. It's about how far from reality the base will get.\\n\\nMaybe Trump's inevitable withdrawal from the scene will reduce that distance somewhat. Maybe without Trump at the center, the One America and Newsmax audience will return to Fox. Maybe Fox will be able to broadly shift back from being pro-Trump to being anti-Democrat. But for the past 12 years, the movement has all been in the other direction, toward more extreme and wild assertions."}
{"original": "It's the latest organizing effort by tech workers, who have gone public with frustrations over what they say are unfair labor practices and unethical business deals in recent years. Amazon workers are attempting to form a union at a warehouse in Alabama, while Google contractors in Pittsburgh have voted to form a union. (Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy the end of Monday, the union said the number of new members had grown to more than 400.\\n\\nMuch of Silicon Valley has pushed back against unionization efforts, surveilling suspected organizers and hiring consultants to suppress nascent efforts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe've always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce, said Kara Silverstein, Google's director of people operations, in a statement. Of course our employees have protected labor rights that we support. But as we've always done, we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees.\\n\\nThe Alphabet union is attempting a new path forward to avoid that. Typically, unions are formed after an election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board, the agency enforcing U.S. labor law. If the majority of voters choose to join, the NLRB certifies the union to represent the workers and bargain collectively with their employer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe union at Alphabet is forming without federal ratification, limiting its rights. And Google has signaled its willingness in the past to fight back against such efforts. In December, the NLRB filed a complaint against Google, accusing it of surveilling and terminating employees, and in 2019, the company hired consultants known for their anti-union efforts.\\n\\nCommunications Workers of America, a labor union representing more than 700,000 members, is supporting the Alphabet union. CWA Communications Director Beth Allen said that even without the NLRB certification, this type of organizing is considered protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe CWA includes other unions without collective bargaining rights, Allen said, such as the Texas State Employees Union, which represents 11,000 public-sector workers who are generally not allowed collective bargaining rights under state law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnions working with the NLRB typically have to deal with narrowly defined work groups, limited by type of worker or location, which makes it very easy for employers to attack, Allen said.\\n\\nShe compared the Alphabet union to CWA's partnership with bank workers from Wells Fargo, who in recent years were able to push for changes to sales goals and incentive structures that they said led to unethical practices. However, the group to which those workers belong, the Committee for Better Banks, is not a union.\\n\\nLegal scholars disagree about whether the National Labor Relations Act requires employers to recognize minority unions, said Catherine Fisk, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. But this model of organizing was standard practice in the United States in the 1930s, before companies found a strategic advantage shifting norms toward unions certified by the NLRB election process.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe NLRB as it operates today is the product of decades of litigation, much of it organized by companies aiming to make it more difficult to organize a union that has a right to bargain collectively, Fisk said.\\n\\nWhat's more unusual is the Alphabet union's decision to welcome contractors, Fisk said. Companies have figured out they can lower their labor costs by hiring their workers as contractors, because essentially it allows them to opt out of protective labor and employee laws legislation, so the group of workers who are eligible to unionize under the NLRA has correspondingly shrunk, she said.\\n\\nThe Alphabet Workers Union will have an elected board of directors and paid organizing staff members, according to the group's news release. Members will pay 1 percent of total compensation, which includes salary and equity. A representative declined to say how many of the 230 or so members are full-time employees versus contractors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis union builds upon years of courageous organizing by Google workers, Nicki Anselmo, Google program manager, said in a statement that referenced the company's decision not to renew a Pentagon contract to analyze drone footage after employees protested. From fighting the 'real names' policy, to opposing Project Maven, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who've committed sexual harassment, we've seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively.\\n\\nShe continued, Our new union provides a sustainable structure to ensure that our shared values as Alphabet employees are respected even after the headlines fade."}
{"original": "As a rational policy, daylight saving time may be ineffective. But as a social ritual, it retains real value. Our biannual clock-tuning is a slip of the mask, a glitch in the matrix that reminds us that clock time is always artificial and arbitrary.\\n\\nStandardized clock time is immensely useful. It is no exaggeration to say that the modern world depends on it: Ships once required it to navigate. The GPS systems that guide our cars, planes and farm combines count on standard time to calculate their positions. If you think setting up a phone call between Washington and London is difficult now because of differing time zones, imagine if local time varied by a few minutes between Washington and Pittsburgh, a few degrees of longitude west. In a society dependent on just-in-time supply chains and automated trading that works in microseconds, accurate, precisely calibrated time is as important as electricity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut standardized time can be, and has been, used against us. Whether you get more out of clock time than it gets out of you is largely a function of your economic security. Almost 90 years after John Maynard Keynes's prediction that the future would hold 15-hour workweeks and lives of leisure, we feel increasingly time-starved. Sociologist Judy Wajcman, in her book Pressed for Time, calls this the time-pressure paradox: Standardized time — in which DST is an archaic wrinkle — contributes to a world of labor-saving innovations. But the time they free up is immediately filled by demands for more work, and greater and more varied demands on our attention.\\n\\n* * * * * * * *\\n\\nWe can sketch out three distinct eras of time reckoning between antiquity and the present. The earliest calendars were linked to the movement of the sun, moon and planets. An enduring legacy of this: Within the days of our week are encoded the names of the sun, moon and five planets visible to ancient Babylonian astronomers. The story of social time since then has been a gradual decoupling from natural reference points. First the seven-day week broke free of the lunar cycle, becoming, sociologist Eviatar Zerubavel argues, the first major rhythm of human activity that is totally oblivious to nature, resting on mathematical regularity alone. As such, he writes, the week ought to be regarded as one of the greatest breakthroughs in the history of human civilization. With the Industrial Revolution, clock time liberated the workday from solar time and established labor routines organized by schedules — the 9-to-5 job being the ultimate expression of this. In the 21st century, work has escaped the bounds of the 9-to-5 schedule, organized instead around what media scholar Robert Hassan calls network time. Under network time, we're expected to do our jobs whenever the task demands it, no matter what our local time is.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf time can be used to command our attention and impose order on our lives, then the ability to set it, and ultimately to decide how others use it, is a source of tremendous power. When clocks became fixtures in 19th-century British factories, workers complained that their bosses unfairly set the clocks ahead in the morning and back at night, to squeeze more labor out of the day. Workmen, historian E.P. Thompson noted, feared carrying their own watches, since it was no uncommon event for managers to fire any worker who presumed to know too much about the science of horology.\\n\\nIn 1880, Britain adopted Greenwich Mean Time as legal standard time. Four years later, an international conference named GMT as the global prime meridian, against which all other times would be set.The Royal Observatory in Greenwich became a key tool of imperial administration: The time of day in any given place would now be dictated by technocrats in London, rather than by the position of the sun overhead, as it had been for thousands of years. In this way, postal routes, train travel, workdays, markets and meetings could be coordinated. But many found the idea alienating. In 1894, Martial Bourdin, a 26-year-old French anarchist, died in London after a homemade bomb he was carrying exploded in his hands. Police speculated that his target was the Greenwich observatory. It would have been, in the language of modern counterterrorism, a highly symbolic soft target for an anarchist.\\n\\nIn the United States, the adoption of standard time was pushed by the progressive movement as a civilizing project, but it was also championed by railroad titans and business interests for whom coordinating economic activity across large distances was a major advantage. Standard time met opposition from laborers who worried that their time of recreation would be curtailed, the Detroit Free Press reported. Others, worried about economic expediency superseding traditional local control, protested the substitution of railroad tycoon Jay Gould's time for God's time.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTime clocks remain a site of battle between workers and employers. In 2013, warehouse workers at Amazon (whose owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns this newspaper) sued over rules that required them to clock out before waiting up to 25 minutes for a mandatory anti-shoplifting screening on their way out the door. The Supreme Court sided with Amazon. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, as part of a long-running campaign to curb the power of academics, has proposed a rule requiring professors to report the number of hours they spend teaching, as opposed to conducting other activities such as research. Employers, for their part, worry about hourly employees committing time-clock fraud — for example, by taking breaks while clocked in or clocking in for a worker who hasn't yet arrived.\\n\\nIn a move that would complete the decoupling of social time from natural rhythms, economist Steve Hanke and physicist Dick Henry think we should abolish time zones altogether, in favor of a single global time. Noon in London would be noon in Beijing, regardless of whether it was night or day. That would ease global commerce. But the interests it would serve are mostly those of people who, by advantage or by necessity, carry out work over great distances, regardless of their local temporal context.\\n\\n* * * * * * * *\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSociologist Georg Simmel wrote that the major problem of modern life was how to preserve one's individuality and independence against the overwhelming pressure of society — everyone's individual struggle to avoid being levelled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism. Standard time, with all the devices and people that make it possible and rely on it, is part of that mechanism."}

The WHO warned travelers away from visiting Beijing and Toronto, the first time in its history to issue such a sweeping alert.\\n\\nChina's secrecy during the outbreak circumvented the WHO's ability to declare a public health emergency, which is a useful tool in coordinating countries' response to the spread of an infectious disease.

The symptoms of the disease are mild, but the virus caused a scare in the United States due to its effects on pregnant women. In 2016, the WHO issued a travel advisory for Zika-impacted countries where the disease was linked to miscarriages, stillbirths and a birth defect called microcephaly. The outcomes of microcephaly in infants include intellectual disabilities, serious speech problems and motor problems, which led the WHO to declare a global health emergency to prevent the spread of the virus. The United States has seen about 20 cases of the Zika virus, and in the 88 countries where the disease has been reported, hundreds of thousands have been infected, with nearly 2,200 babies born with microcephaly.\\n\\n[Mapping the spread of the new coronavirus]\\n\\nH1N1\\n\\n\\n\\nA student receives a vaccine against the A(H1N1) flu at a high school in the western French town of Quimper on November 25, 2009.

The swine flu pandemic, which originated as a respiratory illness in pigs, killed 358 children in the United States. It prompted travel restrictions in nearly a quarter of the countries in the world, and many imposed pork bans targeting NAFTA-affiliated countries.\\n\\nAt the height of the outbreak, a number of countries imposed travel restrictions on flights in and out of Mexico, which resulted in a 40 percent decrease in traffic volume. A vaccine has been developed for H1N1, but due to the cyclical nature of flu season, new strains pop up — e.g., H7N9 — which has caused a spike in flu-related deaths as recently as 2018.\\n\\nMERS\\n\\nThe spread of inaccurate information became a central conflict amid the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome that was identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. Worries over MERS (a strain of the coronavirus) began after the world's slow response to the Ebola outbreak had the international community questioning the leaders of Saudi Arabia about the effects of the disease and the adequacy of Saudi health facilities. MERS killed at least 13 people, infected more than 100 and was brought to South Korea by a passenger who had traveled from Saudi Arabia in 2015, which tested the WHO's rapid-response apparatus in controlling the disease's spread. MERS led to two deaths in South Korea, the closing of 500 schools and more than 1,300 people quarantined.\\n\\nLauren Tierney, Tim Meko, Joe Fox, Simon Denyer, Lena H.

{"original": "That policy, in place for 30 years, runs counter to an Obama-era regulation barring religious discrimination in the federally funded foster-care program. Now, with Miracle Hill's funding threatened, the Trump administration is being asked by the governor of South Carolina to let Miracle Hill participate anyway.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's the latest clash in a long-running debate over religious freedom and government social services, as three successive administrations have considered how much religion is too much religion when agencies are collecting taxpayer funds. The Trump administration's response in the South Carolina case will signal whether it will adhere to modest limits imposed by the Bush and Obama administrations or whether it will allow religious entities a freer hand.\\n\\nIt also represents a test of the Obama policy, put into place in the final days of that administration. The fact that the Trump administration has yet to give South Carolina an answer suggests the question may be a difficult one even for some conservatives.\\n\\nIn October 2017, Jeff Sessions, attorney general at the time, signaled the Trump administration's view on these issues when he released sweeping guidance on religious freedom, including an admonition that federal grants cannot require religious groups to alter their character.\\n\\nThe issue is playing out in the states as well. In South Carolina, the state has told Miracle Hill its license is in jeopardy, contending it is violating state as well as federal policy. In other states, similar disputes are tied to policies regarding sexual orientation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Philadelphia, the city cut off Catholic Social Services from its foster-care program after learning that the agency would not license same-sex couples. Catholic Social Services is challenging the decision in court.\\n\\nIn Michigan, the American Civil Liberties Union is suing the state over its policy of contracting with child-placement agencies that use religious criteria to turn away gay and lesbian couples who wish to be foster or adoptive parents.\\n\\nStates have an obligation to care for children in the public child-welfare system, said Leslie Cooper, an ACLU attorney. When they hire agencies to care for them . . . they should not be using religious criteria to deny children access to families that they desperately need.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn South Carolina, Miracle Hill was expecting to have been given the okay by now. Trump administration officials have signaled they are sympathetic to its cause, yet the decision has been pending for months.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFounded in 1937, Miracle Hill runs several social service programs, all infused with religion. It will hire only Christians, whether the job is programming, cutting the grass — or being a foster parent.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the state social services agency said there are 11 child-placement agencies in South Carolina with religious affiliations, but Miracle Hill is the only one that insists foster parents share its faith.\\n\\nLehman, the Miracle Hill president, said parents are expected to serve as role models for the children in their care. The children will see what a life dedicated to proclaiming the love of God is about, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe group received nearly $600,000 in state and federal money in the last fiscal year to support foster-care families, about half of its total costs.\\n\\nThe group's religious requirements appear to have come to the attention of the South Carolina Department of Social Services after Beth Lesser, who is Jewish, and her husband were turned away by Miracle Hill.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI was the only Jewish person there, Lesser told the Forward, a newspaper that covers issues of interest to American Jews. It was humiliating to be told essentially Christians over here, Jews over there.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services would say only that it acted after becoming aware that Miracle Hill required a signed statement of faith to participate in the program.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn January 2018, the department wrote to Miracle Hill, stating that its Christians-only policy ran afoul of a federal regulation finalized by the Department of Health and Human Services in the closing days of the Obama administration. That regulation was spurred by complaints about discrimination against potential foster parents on the grounds of religion and, separately, sexual orientation, according to one person involved. The rules bar such discrimination in all HHS programs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe South Carolina agency told Miracle Hill that its policy also runs counter to state rules that bar discrimination based on religion. In its letter, the department noted that Miracle Hill's written policy states it will abide by these state and federal rules.\\n\\nThe Department's request is that Miracle Hill comply with its own policy submitted for licensure, a state official said in a January 2018 letter to the group. She said its license was being downgraded to temporary and warned the temporary license would be valid for no longer than six months. Failure to address these concerns will result in the expiration of Miracle Hill's license as a Child Placing Agency.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Miracle Hill's cause was soon taken up by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R), who asked HHS for a waiver from the nondiscrimination rules. McMaster argued that the regulation was unlawful and violates the group's constitutional rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe regulation, he wrote, effectively requires child placement agencies such as Miracle Hill to abandon their religious beliefs or forgo the available public licensure and funding.\\n\\nHe also persuaded the legislature to override the nondiscrimination provisions set by the Department of Social Services.\\n\\nIn March, Steve Wagner, who runs the HHS division that oversees foster care, wrote to a McMaster aide that he was pushing this hard, according to emails received by the ACLU through a records request. He suggested final approval could come later that month. In July, an HHS official told McMaster's office that she expected that any day the approval letter would receive final clearance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut HHS Secretary Alex Azar has yet to announce a decision — much to the frustration of South Carolina Republicans who have lobbied on behalf of the group. Democrats and liberal groups are publicly campaigning against any exemption.\\n\\nIn a statement, an HHS spokesman gave no timeline for a decision but framed the issue as one of religious freedom, signaling openness to allowing the funding."}

The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.\\n\\nImmigrant advocacy groups sued the administration last year on behalf of five Honduran asylum seekers — two adults and three children — who challenged the legality of the new restrictions on multiple grounds. Moss's ruling addressed the first of their claims: that Cuccinelli lacked the authority to change U.S. asylum policies in the first place.\\n\\nMoss agreed, writing that the vacancy rules require a federal agency's first assistant to assume leadership when the top job is open.\\n\\nCuccinelli's appointment fails to comply with the (law) for a more fundamental and clear-cut reason: he never did and never will serve in a subordinate role — that is, as an 'assistant' — to any other USCIS official, Moss wrote.\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe administration's move to place Cuccinelli in charge was therefore unlawful, he wrote, and the policy memos he signed should be set aside.\\n\\nThose include measures in July to reduce the amount of time afforded to asylum seekers to seek legal counsel after crossing the border and to restrict the ability of U.S. asylum officers to grant applicants extensions.\\n\\nThe implications of the judge's ruling were unclear Sunday for other policy moves and administrative decisions made by Cuccinelli since Trump installed him in June. Cuccinelli remains in the top job at USCIS, and he is serving as the second-ranking official at the Department of Homeland Security, where he has been appointed to the White House's coronavirus task force.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSenior staffers at DHS and USCIS have repeatedly expressed doubts about the legality of Cuccinelli's authority, with several unclear about where he actually works."}

{"original": "When his comments quickly went viral, stoking outrage from critics, Nebraska officials rushed to clarify. Immigrants would still qualify for the vaccine, one Ricketts aide said, but those without legal status would have to wait at the back of the line.\\n\\nNebraska is going to prioritize citizens and legal residents ahead of illegal immigrants, the governor's communications director, Taylor Gage, wrote on Twitter on Monday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat approach still angered many advocates, who argue it could brew mistrust and scare immigrants away from an immunization campaign meant to reach as many people in Nebraska as possible. Despite the remarks from Ricketts, hundreds of undocumented workers do in fact work in the crowded, high-risk facilities deemed essential to the nation's food supply, they say.\\n\\nThis virus isn't discriminating based on immigration status, Dulce Castañeda, an organizer with the activist group Children of Smithfield, said in an interview with The Washington Post. It doesn't ask people if they're a citizen, if they're a resident, if they're on a visa. So why would we ask that for vaccines?\\n\\nMost states, including Nebraska, have been abiding by federal recommendations to provide vaccines to front-line health-care workers first, followed by residents and staff at nursing homes. But the question of who should get the vaccine next, and when, has proved politically fraught across the nation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRepublican governors in Texas and Florida have bucked the advice of public health officials to focus on essential front-line workers, instead opting to rush vaccinations to a wider swath of the elderly. In Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis (D) redrafted a heavily criticized plan that put inmates, who have faced some of the nation's deadliest outbreaks, before those with chronic health conditions.\\n\\nYet no other state appears have publicly suggested it will consider legal status in its immunization campaign — a move that even federal officials have warned could be dangerous.\\n\\nNo one in this country should be denied a vaccine because of their documentation status, because it's not ethically right to deny those individuals, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CBS's Face the Nation last month.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJames Goddard, the senior programs director at the nonprofit Nebraska Appleseed, said in an interview with The Post that it was alarming Ricketts could make undocumented immigrants wait longer for a vaccine. Many are essential workers who in fact deserve high priority given their risk of exposure, he said, and it would be logistically impossible — and potentially illegal — to screen their legal status while administering vaccines.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's terrible public-health policy, he said. Everyone should have equitable access to the vaccine as expeditiously as possible, but we need to prioritize folks based on public health criteria, not on where someone is from.\\n\\nEarly in the pandemic, the virus ripped through meatpacking facilities in Nebraska and nearby states, infecting thousands of workers at some plants and killing hundreds as plant managers struggled to implement health and safety measures.\\n\\nDuring a Monday news conference, Ricketts and Nebraska health officials announced the state was planning to begin administering shots for those 75 and older, working with local health departments as well as pharmacies and medical clinics. Essential workers, including those in meatpacking plants, would not receive vaccines until later, they said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPressed by reporters, Ricketts repeatedly suggested no undocumented workers are employed at Nebraska meatpacking plants.\\n\\nAccording to estimates from the Migration Policy Institute, however, undocumented workers make up about 11 percent of the workforce in meatpacking plants in Nebraska, and about 10 percent in facilities nationwide.\\n\\nCastañeda, whose activist group has rallied for better protections at the Smithfield pork plant in Crete, Neb., said she has personally been in contact with over a dozen undocumented workers at the facility.\\n\\nOne widely shared Twitter post about Ricketts's plan — which was retweeted by people including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who called the governor's approach racist — erroneously suggested he would seek to deny the vaccine to all undocumented meat packing workers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGage on Monday clarified that U.S. citizenship was not a requirement to receive the vaccine, noting the federal government is expected to eventually make enough vaccine available for everyone in the country. (He did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post late on Tuesday.)\\n\\nAnd nowhere in Nebraska's 36-page vaccination plan do officials make a note of citizenship or legal status.\\n\\nFor Castañeda, however, the damage may have already been done."}
{"original": "You look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system, she said. Your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be 10 percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to, like, the tippy tops — on your 10 millionth dollar — sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.\\n\\nThat's a broadly accurate statement: Fifty years ago, the tax rate on the highest bracket of income was indeed over 70 percent. It applied only to income past the first $400,000 or so until 1965, which is presumably what Ocasio-Cortez meant by the tippy tops.\\n\\nThis is an important distinction that has been blurred in the aftermath of Ocasio-Cortez's comments. If she were proposing that incomes above $10 million be taxed at a rate of 70 percent, she's not suggesting that those making $10 million or more be taxed at 70 percent for every dollar. As The Washington Post's Christopher Ingraham noted Monday, everyone would pay the same amount of tax on every dollar of income below that level.\\n\\nUsing tax bracket data from BankRate.com, we can visualize the relationship between income and taxes paid. Below $200,000 or so, there's some jerkiness to the lines as incomes above a certain point are subject to higher rates.\\n\\nBut extend that outward as we look at higher and higher income levels, and the line is essentially smooth.\\n\\nBecause every dollar over the $500,000 mark for a single filer is taxed at 37 percent, and because as more income is added, that first $500,000 makes up a smaller percentage of the total, the amount that's paid in taxes for the wealthiest Americans ends up being at about 37 percent of income. (Math nerds: Please write this in the form of a limit.) There are tons of caveats and loopholes, as anyone who has ever filled out a tax return can attest, but we're making a point broadly about how the system works, so these figures will suffice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLet's now introduce the figure that has been most talked about from Ocasio-Cortez's comments: a 70 percent bracket starting at $10 million.\\n\\nIn other words, a shift that looks like this.\\n\\nNow notice that until $10 million, the black line representing Ocasio-Cortez's sort-of proposal and the gray dashed line indicating the status quo are identical. They diverge only after $10 million, resulting in added tax revenue indicated in the shaded green area.\\n\\nHow much could that raise? Our Jeff Stein talked to experts: $720 billion in a decade.\\n\\nNow, remember, this applies only to people who make $10 million or more in a year and only to their incomes starting at that $10 million mark. Through dollar number 9,999,999, those people are still paying a bit less than 37 percent on their income. The effect of Ocasio-Cortez's comments would be that wealthier Americans would keep slightly less of their income than they do now, but as they made more money, they'd still be keeping more income, too.\\n\\nFor all of the hand-wringing over her comments, not all of it sincere, it's worth remembering that almost no one would be affected by such a change. In 2016, the IRS reported that only about 16,000 tax returns included adjusted incomes of at least $10 million — 0.01 percent of the 150 million returns filed.\\n\\nAgain, this was not a hard-and-fast policy proposal. If it becomes one, there's plenty more analysis to be done about the effects and plenty of debate over what percentage to apply at what income level."}
{"original": "But that's easier said than done. The party's conservative core is generally opposed to much government activity, prefers letting market forces run unimpeded and places priority on keeping taxes and spending low. Working-class voters, however, have always wanted active government and place a higher value on protection from market depredations than on abstract ideas of limited government. Squaring this circle is not impossible, but it will require intentional and ongoing management by the party's leaders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe battle over the $2,000 checks shows how not to manage this tension. Orthodox conservatives oppose the checks because they would lead to more debt. They hew to the old preferences for limited government activity and prioritization of debt control regardless of the circumstances facing the country. So-called populists such as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), however, favor sending the checks on the theory that government must act indiscriminately in time of need. Both impulses fail to understand the working-class mind-set and weaken the conservative and working-class coalition both sides want to create.\\n\\nThe orthodox conservative view's shortcoming is obvious. Caring more about debt than people in need is a classic flaw that Democrats have successfully exploited since the days of the Great Depression. Working-class voters will always back a party that understands that they need government to give them a fair shot at earning what they deserve. That means support for legitimate union organizing, protection against unfair foreign competition via trade or illegal immigration, and entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare that ensure they are not impoverished through what Ronald Reagan called unemployment by reason of old age.\\n\\nConservatives who sought to build working-class support have failed whenever they hewed to these views in times of crisis. Dwight D. Eisenhower touted his modern Republicanism as the cure to the party's post-New Deal woes, but that effort ran aground on the shoals of fiscal conservatism during the deep recession of 1958. Unemployment reached 7.5 percent that July, but Eisenhower still tried to cut federal spending and maintain a balanced budget. The GOP lost 48 House seats that year and did not win back the majority until 1994.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, who rose to power in 2006, also sought to make his conservative Moderate Party into the Swedish Worker's Party, bringing his party to post-Depression heights with policies designed to reduce unemployment. But by 2014, his refusal to limit mass migration of refugees led to workers deserting the Moderates for the economically populist and anti-immigration Sweden Democrats. Current polls show Moderates have dropped back to their traditional level of support, roughly 20 percent of the vote.\\n\\nBut Hawley's populist view is also fatally flawed. Working-class voters have a strong sense of desert and need that underlies their views on government action. They oppose aid for people who don't deserve or need help, whether they are people who prefer to take government aid without working or the rich who get tax write-offs and preferential treatment to fund their comfortable lifestyles. Giving $2,000 checks without regard to how covid-19 has affected an individual means nonworking poor and hard-working rich alike will get checks they neither deserve nor need. Analysis of the House-passed bill that would provide the $2,000 checks shows that nearly one-third of the aid would go to taxpayers making more than $100,000 a year, and nearly 9 percent would go to people making between $200,000 and $500,000. Splashing cash on well-to-do people is not the way to win working-class votes.\\n\\nThe right approach to pandemic relief is to be generous to people and businesses that need help and stingy to those that don't. That means enhanced unemployment checks for the long-term unemployed and continuing government support of businesses that are suffering from government-imposed pandemic restriction regardless of the cost. It also means saying no to the vast majority of Americans who haven't lost their jobs or suffered large drops in income during the pandemic. Help for the truly needy, not handouts or hands off, is both good policy and good politics.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBuilding the conservative and working-class coalition will require hard work and compromise. Building a generous and targeted relief package is a good place to start.\\n\\nSign up to receive my columns in your inbox as soon as they're published."}

{"original": "The substance, which is imported from Southeast Asia and marketed as a supplement, has become increasingly popular among consumers looking for relief from pain, anxiety and depression as well as opioid-withdrawal symptoms. Kratom, which is sometimes used for recreation, can produce a feeling of euphoria. Advocates call it a safe way to deal with chronic pain and other conditions, and some researchers are exploring whether it helps people overcome addictions. But other researchers warn that the herb, taken in capsules or by drinking tea, is too risky to use.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGottlieb, in a November public health advisory and again Tuesday, said there are no FDA-approved uses for kratom. The agency is now aware of 44 kratom-associated deaths between April 2011 and last December, including one in which the individual had no known historical or toxicologic evidence of opioid use, except for kratom.\\n\\nIn many of those cases, kratom was used along with other drugs, making it difficult for authorities to determine the actual cause of death. Kratom proponents have said the government sometimes blames kratom for deaths caused by other substances, but the new fatality cited by the FDA, given the absence of other substances, reinforces our concerns, Gottlieb said.\\n\\nThe new FDA analysis comes as the Drug Enforcement Administration considers whether to classify kratom as a controlled substance. In 2016, the DEA announced plans to place kratom temporarily in Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, a category for drugs such as heroin. The move would have effectively banned its use. But officials backtracked after a public outcry and pressure from some members of Congress. In withdrawing its plan, the agency asked the FDA to speed up a scientific and medical evaluation on kratom.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe FDA provided that evaluation late last year. A DEA spokeswoman said Tuesday that it could take months or even years to decide whether to schedule something as a controlled substance.\\n\\nGottlieb said his agency developed its computational model to identify the possibility of abuse of designer street drugs for which there is little pharmacological data. The model, he said, can predict how a substance will behave in the body and affect various receptors in the brain based on its chemical structure and its similarity to drugs for which there is data.\\n\\nUsing that model, FDA scientists analyzed the 25 most common compounds in kratom and concluded that all of them share the most structural similarities with opioid painkillers such as morphine derivatives. The model also showed that 22 of the compounds bind strongly to opioid receptors in the brain and to receptors that may contribute to stress responses that impact neurological and cardiovascular function.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe agency previously warned of kratom's side effects, including seizures and respiratory depression.\\n\\nAfter the FDA's November announcement, Jack Henningfield, an addiction specialist who works at the drug policy consulting group Pinney Associates, said that surveys of kratom users suggest that many are taking the supplement to help stop using opioids. Henningfield, who has done work for the nonprofit American Kratom Association, argued late last year that the substance's overall abuse potential and risk of death isn't anything close to narcotics like opioids, and warned that restricting or banning it could drive some people onto the black market to buy it or push them back to opioids.\\n\\nThe association estimates that 3 million to 5 million people in the United States have used kratom or are doing so."}

Simply put, this is a terrific choice, McPherson said in a statement issued after the nomination.\\n\\nDroegemeier is the first meteorologist to hold this position. Many researchers expressed hope Droegemeier might give them a louder voice in Trump's decision-making process.

Congratulations on your confirmation, finally(!!!)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nContacted Thursday, a spokesman for OSTP was not available to comment because of the government shutdown.\\n\\nDespite the earlier absence of an administrator, OSTP over the past two years has forged ahead with a full agenda. It has sought to advance private-sector research in areas such as artificial intelligence, in part by convening tech giants and other industry experts for a new, policy-focused task force in 2018. It has helped guide the White House's early work to put more self-flying drones in U.S. skies and expand Internet access to rural areas. During that time, the office's most senior official was Michael Kratsios, a former aide to venture capitalist Peter Thiel. Kratsios joined the administration in its early days to serve as deputy chief technology officer.\\n\\nThose and other issues now fall to Droegemeier, who, like other appointees in the administration, faces a challenge in breaking through to Trump's inner circle. His predecessor, John Holdren, had a close relationship with President Barack Obama, and OSTP had a much larger staff under Obama's watch.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe hope that the president and senior administrators use him more fully, said former congressman Rush Holt, chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In other administrations, that's not so. We'll see how this develops.\\n\\nHolt said the challenge will be especially acute on climate change. Droegemeier's background in extreme weather contrasts greatly with the president, who said in November in response to a report about the effects of climate change: I don't believe it.\\n\\nI hope he will find some way to use his background, combined with his very pleasant and accessible manner, to elevate the concern for action with respect to climate change. That's going to be hard for him, Holt said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\\n\\nRepublican state lawmakers have filed a wave of bills that would ban medical professionals from treating transgender teens with hormones and sex reassignment surgery, reigniting a polarizing national debate over the rights of transgender youths and the government's reach into doctors' offices.\\n\\nMore than half a dozen statehouses are considering bills that would penalize medical professionals — and, in at least one case, parents — who give young people access to puberty-blocking medicines and other treatments. Conservative lawmakers argue that they are protecting vulnerable children who may be experimenting with their identity from making life-altering changes to their bodies, a characterization that advocates for transgender youths call misinformed and dangerous.\\n\\nSouth Dakota on Wednesday became the first state to take action, with a House committee passing a bill that would punish doctors who provide such treatments to people under 16 with a maximum one year in jail and a fine of up to $2,000.\\n\\nState Rep. Fred Deutsch (R) said he introduced the bill because the solution for children's identification with the opposite sex isn't to poison their bodies with megadoses of the wrong hormones, to chemically or surgically castrate and sterilize them, or to remove healthy breasts and reproductive organs.\\n\\nSimilar bills have been introduced in recent weeks in South Carolina, Colorado, Florida, Oklahoma and Missouri. State lawmakers in Kentucky, Georgia and Texas have announced plans to file bills that limit transgender youths' medical options.\\n\\nMissouri's bill would report parents who consent to such treatment to child welfare officials for child abuse. Doctors also would have their licenses revoked if they perform gender-reassignment treatments.\\n\\nThe speed and number of state bills has mobilized transgender activists, suicide prevention groups and civil rights organizations that say conservative lawmakers are gravely misinformed about medical interventions for transgender youths and are sensationalizing the issue.\\n\\nThey say the legislative restrictions are unnecessary because the process of transitioning is methodical and rarely includes surgery before age 18. Transgender children typically transition socially first, advocates say, changing their names, pronouns and dress to match their gender identities.\\n\\n[For one non-binary teen, coming of age means getting their parents to embrace a new name]\\n\\nSam Brinton, head of government affairs at the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention service that focuses on ­LGBTQ youths, compared the legislation to the controversial bathroom bills that prohibited transgender people from using locker rooms, public restrooms and other sex-segregated facilities that matched their gender identity.\\n\\nThese bans on medical care are just the bathroom bills 2.0. It's fearmongering. Same old transphobia, different bill, Brinton said. And they are preying on some the weakest and most vulnerable in our community.\\n\\nIn 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy statement that recommended giving youths access to comprehensive gender-affirming and developmentally appropriate health care, while noting the benefits and risks of using hormones that delay puberty.\\n\\nBut some worry that such medical intervention is being used on youths too young to understand the potential consequences. A bill under consideration in Florida would make it a felony for doctors to provide certain hormones or gender reassignment surgery to minors, even with parental consent.\\n\\nA great majority of Americans and Floridians agree that a ­12-year-old should not change their body in such a permanent way, said Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini (R), who introduced the bill.\\n\\nSabatini said he was inspired to file the legislation after learning about a divorce custody case in Texas in which a father objected to his 7-year-old child socially transitioning, which the mother encouraged. Donald Trump Jr. tweeted about the case in October, calling it child abuse.\\n\\nSome Republican lawmakers have been more hesitant. Utah state Rep. Brad Daw (R) drafted a bill that would restrict puberty blockers and hormone treatments for youths, believing that such decisions were irreversible. But then he did further research, met with advocates and spoke with families who described puberty blockers as a lifesaver that prevented young people from committing suicide.\\n\\nYou can't just ignore that, Daw said.\\n\\nHe also learned that puberty restarts when youths stop taking the blockers, and said he is reconsidering what kind of bill would make the most sense.\\n\\nI'm not certain of anything right now, Daw said. What I'm certain about is this topic is a lot more complex and lot more nuanced than I would have believed. It may not be an all or nothing.\\n\\n[A Texas man says his 7-year-old isn't transgender. Now his custody fight has reached the governor's office.]\\n\\nAdvocates have called the anti-LGBTQ state bills submitted this legislative session a slate of hate, including a Florida statehouse bill to repeal ordinances that prohibit conversion therapy for ­LGBTQ youths. Legislation restricting transgender students' sports participation is pending in Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Washington state, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.\\n\\nThe bills are being used as an election year scare tactic, lightning rod issue to bring conservatives and swing voters out, said Taylor Brown, an attorney with Lambda Legal, an ­LGBT civil rights group. Brown worries transgender children will suffer as debates over the legislation fan the flames of the country's bitter culture war.\\n\\nTransgender advocates say that people supporting limitations on medical intervention for transgender youths are spreading medical inaccuracies, citing right-wing websites that accuse parents of allowing young children to undergo double mastectomies or castration as young as age 10.\\n\\nSouth Dakota state Rep. Linda K. Duba (D) called Deutsch's bill cruel and just totally unconstitutional, saying that transgender medical treatments should be a private matter between youths, their parents and their doctors.\\n\\nWe all need to learn more about what we don't know or understand. I do have friends who are trans as well as friends who have trans children, Duba said. No one would voluntarily choose to go through this pain and discrimination. Unfortunately, I live in a state where religion and fear of the unknown drive decisions.\\n\\nSouth Dakota's legislature is often used as a testing ground for conservative bills, because Republicans hold a supermajority in the statehouse and there's a low cost for lobbying in the state. It was one of the first states to pass a law restricting transgender students' bathroom use. That 2016 law was ultimately vetoed by the governor, but it helped build momentum for a flurry of bathroom bills across the country.\\n\\nDeutsch said he began considering the bill last spring, after he met people on Twitter who said they were formerly transgender and were hurting and suffering as a result of the treatments.\\n\\nHe has framed the bill as homegrown, but said he consulted with conservative groups such as the Liberty Counsel and Kelsey Coalition as he was drafting it. In October, Deutsch attended the Summit for Protecting Children from Sexualization in the District hosted by the right-wing Heritage Foundation, which discussed similar efforts criminalizing transgender care in other states, he said.\\n\\nA website promoting Deutsch's bill includes videos from the Heritage Foundation and a parent resource guide from the Minnesota Family Council, a Christian organization aligned with the Family Research Council. The website also includes quotes from people who say they regret gender transitioning.\\n\\nSome advocates and physicians framed the bill as a solution looking for a problem. Fewer than four physicians in South Dakota offer puberty blockers and hormone therapies, and it is unclear if any perform surgeries for transgender patients, advocates and doctors say.\\n\\nQuinn Parke, of Sioux Falls, S.D., began taking hormone blockers at 16, after struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts so severe Parke was admitted to a hospital.\\n\\nParke, who identifies as ­non-binary and uses they and them pronouns, said it took more than a year of appointments with doctors and psychologists to get the prescription to temporarily stop hormonal changes and mood swings that were worsening the teenager's gender dysphoria. Parke testified at Wednesday's hearing in Pierre, S.D.\\n\\nIt wasn't just like one person making the decision. It was dozens of people, said Parke of the choice to take puberty blockers.\\n\\nQuinn Parke's mother, Kim Parke, said the puberty blockers have drastically improved the teenager's self-esteem and mood, but she doesn't think lawmakers realize the months of consultations that preceded the prescription.\\n\\nIt's frustrating because . . . it wasn't an easy thing to get there, and it wasn't an easy decision, Kim Parke said. We did a lot of thinking on it.\\n\\nWhile the South Dakota bill wouldn't take away existing prescriptions, Quinn Parke worries about friends who are younger and just beginning to look into puberty blockers.\\n\\nI've been in their shoes and I know what it's like to not have this when you need it, Quinn Parke said. To politicians who want to further restrict access, the teen says, You keep saying you want to protect us, but everything you're doing is just making our lives worse."}
{"original": "The report was written in compliance with President Trump's March 2017 executive order halting immigration from six majority-Muslim countries.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCritics immediately expressed alarm at what they considered highly misleading data presented without context. They called it an attempt to misuse law enforcement agencies to advance a political agenda in opposition to immigration, and former senior counterterrorism officials warned it could play into terrorists' hands by fueling misperceptions about radicalization and stoking societal divides.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeveral government watchdog and civil liberty groups in May sued the two agencies in two federal courts, seeking a retraction or correction under the little-known Information Quality Act. The agencies refused, and the courts stayed the lawsuits to allow time for an administrative appeal.\\n\\nNow, after two rounds, the Justice Department has told the groups it will not retract or correct the document. Rather, in future reports, the department can strive to minimize the potential for misinterpretation, Michael H. Allen, deputy assistant attorney general for policy, management and planning, wrote in a Dec. 21 letter to the groups.\\n\\nIt is, experts said, a rare admission from the department that its reporting may have confused and misled the public. This is the government's statement on the risk of terrorism presented by foreign-born individuals in the United States, and it's critical that it be accurate — not just because the law requires it but because they have a duty to the American people to accurately report information of this type, said Ben Berwick, counsel for Protect Democracy, one of the groups that sued the government and is representing the others in court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOtherwise, he said, it erodes trust in the government. It erodes democracy.\\n\\nOne flaw the Justice Department acknowledged was the report's assertion that between 2003 and 2009, immigrants were convicted of 69,929 sex offenses, which in most instances constitutes gender-based violence against women.\\n\\nBut, Allen said in his letter, the alleged misrepresented data constitute mere editorial errors which the [law] does not obligate the agencies to withdraw or correct.\\n\\nStill, he added, the department appreciates being made aware of such errors so they will not be repeated.\\n\\nBerwick said the errors were not merely editorial. The nearly 70,000 offenses spanned a period from 1955 to 2010 — 55 years, not six; the data covered arrests, not convictions; and one arrest could be for multiple offenses, he said, citing the Government Accountability Office, which provided the underlying data.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCritics also decried the report's inclusion of eight illustrative examples of foreign-born individuals out of a pool of 402 convicted of international terrorism. Six of the eight cases involved people admitted to the country as family members of legal residents or U.S. citizens, which Protect Democracy contended was an effort to portray chain migration as a threat.\\n\\nOn reconsideration, the department acknowledges that a focus on eight seemingly similar 'illustrative examples' from a list of more than 400 convictions could cause some readers of the report to question its objectivity, Allen wrote.\\n\\nAt least 189 of the 549 people convicted were caught up in an investigation with a link to international terrorism but not charged with an offense directly related to terrorism, Berwick said, citing Justice Department data. It is unclear how many were foreign-born. Nonetheless, that would change the statistics considerably, but the department did not address that in its letter.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe report included about 100 foreign-born individuals who were extradited to the United States to stand trial for terrorism-related crimes committed overseas, without clarifying the reason they were brought to the country, Berwick said. That is misleading because the report creates a false impression that those extradited came in as immigrants, he said.\\n\\nThere is no requirement in either the [law or department guidelines] that agencies must always provide underlying data when disseminating information to the public, Allen wrote.\\n\\nThe coalition of groups is considering whether to return to court."}
{"original": "The question is: Do they deserve such extraordinary sums?\\n\\nSchwarzman declined an invitation to talk through that question. But it's a fair guess that as a staunch defender of free markets, he considers his take a proper reward for his talent, hard work, ingenuity and willingness to take risk over many years. In the past, he has criticized those who blame the wealthy for stagnant middle-class incomes and rising inequality. And when the Obama administration proposed a change in tax law that would have reduced his income, an outraged (and later apologetic) Schwarzman likened it to Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the theoretical models favored by economists, what Schwarzman or anyone else earns in the marketplace is thought to reflect how much we add to economic output — in the language of economics, our marginal productivity.\\n\\nMy own reading of the evidence is that most of the very wealthy get that way by making substantial economic contribution, Harvard economist Greg Mankiw wrote in a much remarked-upon essay a few years back that was titled Defending the One Percent.\\n\\nIndeed, if we still had an economy of independent, self-sufficient farmers and artisans, Mankiw's mental model might be the correct one. Someone could point to a bushel of tomatoes or a hand-knit sweater and credibly make the claim, I produced that. It is the fruit of my labor, so what I earn from it in the competitive marketplace is my property, my just desert.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in a modern economy, creating products and services is a team sport, with individuals constantly interacting with other individuals and firms in complex arrangements that make it much more difficult to determine each person's contribution to overall economic output. There are differences in market power between firms, and differences of individual power within firms, both of which have a significant effect on exactly who earns what.\\n\\nOne of the reasons Blackstone is so successful, for example, is that as one of the biggest private-equity firms, it gets a first look at most of the best investment opportunities. Everyone who works at, or invests with, Blackstone benefits from that kind of market power. And within Blackstone, Schwarzman has the sole discretion in setting the bonuses for top executives, according to its annual proxy filings.\\n\\nMore significantly, the amount anyone earns at Blackstone, or any other firm, is influenced by the rules, laws and norms that govern business behavior and market competition.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs someone who buys and sells companies, for example, Schwarzman has benefited handsomely from a uniquely American business environment in which companies are run with the single-minded focus of maximizing returns to shareholders and investors, rather than balancing the interests of all stakeholders.\\n\\nThe hotel companies and amusement parks that Blackstone has owned (Hilton, La Quinta, Motel 6, Six Flags, Busch Gardens) have benefited from a federal minimum wage that hasn't budged in more than a decade, and labor laws that now make it almost impossible for workers to vote in a union at any company that is determined to stop them.\\n\\nOver the past 30 years, the weakening of antitrust enforcement and regulations meant to protect consumers and investors have boosted the profits and increased the value of Blackstone-owned companies in the waste management, cable television, telephone, funeral and nursing home industries.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs a big investor in corporate debt, Blackstone also has benefited from bankruptcy rules that favor bondholders over workers, as it did in the restructuring of telecom firm Avaya in which $360 million in unfunded pension liabilities was effectively shifted to the government's pension guarantee agency.\\n\\nThe extraordinarily low interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve in recent years have boosted valuations for the many real estate investments that Blackstone has made, including its $37.7 billion purchase of Equity Office Properties at the top of the last real estate bubble. Low interest rates also have provided Blackstone with the financial headroom to shower its investors and executives with huge one-time dividends financed with debt.\\n\\nLiberalized trade treaties have made it possible for Blackstone-owned firms such as Freescale Semiconductor and TRW Auto Parts to lower costs by moving work to low-wage countries overseas. The same treaties have also made it possible for Blackstone to attract more foreign investors, like the sovereign wealth funds of China and Saudi Arabia, while opening new investment opportunities for Blackstone abroad, such as Legoland and Versace.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nScharzman and his partners have benefited handsomely from the favorable tax treatment for carried interest, and the ability to defer taxes on profitable investments that are exchanged for new ones. And under the new law, their taxes will be lower, and returns higher, as a result of the new lower rates for corporations and partnerships. The repeal of the estate tax will also leave wealthy families with more money to invest in Blackstone funds.\\n\\nThe point here is not to quarrel with these policy choices (although there is much to quarrel with) or to suggest that Blackstone has benefited more than other firms (although that is probably the case). Rather, it is to illustrate that the amount that Schwarzman or anyone else earns in any year in the marketplace is determined in no small part by rules and norms that govern market competition.\\n\\nThose rules and norms were not set in place by some all-knowing invisible hand — they were politically and socially determined. That is why wars have been fought over them, legislative battles have been waged over them and elections have been won and lost because of them. And it is why Blackstone and other companies spend lavishly on lobbying and electing friendly politicians who are in a position to shape them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder different sets of rules and norms, the market might have valued Schwarzman's economic contribution last year at a measly $393 million — half of what he did receive, but surely still enough to persuade him to contribute his excellence.\\n\\nMarkets, in other words, are social constructs, and the idea that they generate a distribution of income based on a purely objective measure of individual economic contribution is a fiction, nothing more than free-market ideology. When it comes to the distribution of income, there is no pure market. Any distribution is, by its nature, political, reflecting changing social norms and the distribution of political power.\\n\\nTo point this out is not to suggest that I know of a more objective system for determining how income should distributed. Rather, it is to suggest that if we, as a society, decide that we find the current distribution of income unacceptable — if it offends our moral intuitions that a single financier earns as much in a year as 15,000 elementary school teachers — then it violates no great moral or economic principle to alter that distribution.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne way to make the distribution of income more equal would be to change some of the rules and norms that govern market competition.\\n\\nAnother would be to leave the rules and norms in place and alter the distribution after the market has delivered its judgment, through more progressive taxation and government spending.\\n\\nThe first has been called predistribution, the second redistribution, and there may be good economic and political reasons for favoring one or the other. But from a moral viewpoint, there is no meaningful distinction between the two. Both reflect the ways that societies determine the distribution of income based on subjective judgments of what is fair.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDefenders of free markets have long argued that shifting income away from those whom the market judges more talented and more productive would be to deny them their just deserts. But as a moral concept, just deserts is inadequate and incomplete.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor in determining whether any distribution of income is just, it is not enough to inquire whether someone has earned his income by playing by the rules. We must also look at the distribution of income and ask whether the rules themselves are fair and just."}
{"original": "Alexandria's efforts to address its long-standing sewage discharge into the Potomac River should be addressed by mid-2020, or the city will risk losing all its state appropriations, under a bill that passed a Virginia Senate committee Thursday.\\n\\nThe legislative action is far from complete — the bill must be voted on by the full Senate and then survive scrutiny in the House as well — but Sen. Scott A. Surovell (D-Fairfax) said that he and several of his colleagues believe the city has the financial capacity to fix these problems, but it's dragging its feet.\\n\\nAlexandria is under a federal order to stop allowing sewer overflows into Hunting Creek, a Potomac River tributary, and it has given the state a $188 million plan for how it will do just that. But half of the raw sewage — about 11 million gallons — that the city sends into the Potomac each year empties into the Oronoco Bay in North Old Town, and no federal or state order demands that be stopped.\\n\\nUnder pressure from local residents and environmentalists, however, the Alexandria City Council voted in November to speed up a study of how to address that pollution by 14 years, with a study to start in 2018 and formal planning to start in 2026.\\n\\n[Alexandria speeds up plans to address sewage overflow into the Potomac]\\n\\nTo say or claim we are not doing enough is just not accurate, said Alexandria Mayor Allison Silberberg.

In 2016 this council has taken major steps forward in commitments, plans and actions.\\n\\nWhile the General Assembly works through its bills, the Potomac Riverkeeper Network is pushing the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality to hold a public hearing on the city's long-term control plan for all the sewage that spills into the river each time it rains. The city's own records, the environmental group says, show unsafe levels of fecal contamination in Oronoco Bay more than half the time the city has sampled the water there from 2007 to 2012.\\n\\nWe are not asking them to eliminate pollution immediately, said Phillip Musegaas, Potomac Riverkeepers' vice president of programs and litigation. We want to see them come up with a comprehensive plan that deals with all the sewage discharges from the city.\\n\\nThomas Faha, the state DEQ's regional director, responded in a Dec. 19 letter that DEQ believes the city exceeded the public participation requirements of the permit and [combined sewer overflow] policy and that given the council's November action, Alexandria's public participation has been sufficiently robust such that there is no need for another public meeting.\\n\\nThe environmental group is appealing that decision.\\n\\nAlexandria, like more than 800 communities across the country, combines its sewage and storm water in an outdated network of pipes that lead to a waste treatment plant. When it rains, those pipes overflow, sending both storm water and sewage into the river.\\n\\nThe city plans to address the Oronoco Bay situation by installing green infrastructure on city property and making tougher demands on new development, requiring separate sewer and storm water systems, for example.\\n\\nTwo months ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency demanded details from the city, asking how much of the expected overflow the green infrastructure will reduce, where and when new pipes will be installed and information documenting overflows for the past five years."}

Niles, the District's deputy mayor for education, said even though this week's report showed a decrease, she expects enough students may transfer into traditional public schools by the end of the year that enrollment will inch up.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNiles said she saw promising trends in middle schools and special program schools, such as the science and technology-focused McKinley Middle.\\n\\nI don't see this as doom and gloom, Nile said. I would describe [D.C. Public Schools] as remaining steady and our charter schools as making a small increase.\\n\\nEnrollment in charter schools — publicly funded but privately operated institutions — grew from 41,506 last year to 43,393 this school year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTaking into account traditional schools, nearly 92,000 students are attending class in public schools in the District, a 1.6 percent increase.\\n\\nThe enrollment numbers for traditional schools are another blow to that system, which has been embroiled in a graduation controversy. A city-commissioned investigation found that about one in three graduates in 2017 received their diplomas despite missing too many classes or improperly taking makeup classes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWill Perkins — a research and policy associate at the 21st Century School Fund, an education advocacy organization — called the numbers troubling for the traditional system, noting that enrollment numbers dropped across most grade levels.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe superintendent's report showed that charter schools had more students (6,929) at the preschool level than traditional schools (5,798). The traditional school system has more kindergartners enrolled than does the charter school system.\\n\\nIn the preschool years, students have to apply through a lottery to secure a slot, even if it is at their neighborhood school. Perkins said if the traditional system guaranteed families preschool slots in their neighborhood schools, it could help the system capture more families.\\n\\nI think it is an issue when families start in charter schools, and may never be in their neighborhood schools, Perkins said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA D.C. Public Schools spokeswoman said the system plans to add slots for 3- and 4-year-olds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite growth in recent years, enrollment in the city's traditional public and charter schools remains far below its peak. The student population had been in a steady decline since the 1960s, when about 150,000 students attended the District's public schools.\\n\\nBy 1995, enrollment had plummeted to about 80,000 students when the D.C. School Reform Act was passed by Congress, paving the way for charter schools to open in the District."}
{"original": "This year's theme is creating a shared future in a fractured world, and the forum's website calls for an unparalleled global effort in co-design, co-creation and collaboration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn his first year in office, Trump railed against international agreements, pulled the United States out of trade pacts and climate deals and pushed an America first agenda. It's a surprise, too, because the forum is filled with journalists, celebrities and chief executives — exactly the kind of coastal elites Trump has criticized. (One of his 2016 campaign ads featured a shot of financier and philanthropist George Soros speaking at Davos as an example of the global power structure crushing the American worker.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA group of Swiss campaigners are so upset about Trump's decision to attend that they've launched a petition to keep him from the forum. Titled, Trump not welcome — stay out of Davos, the petition excoriates the president for his inhumane politics and his opposition to globalization. In just a few hours, it garnered about 5,000 signatures.\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump is on excellent terms with racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, sexism, misogyny, bellicosity, climate change denial, human rights abuse and a policy that deepens poverty and inequality, the petition reads.  … We want to put the 'World First' — not 'America First.'  The petition took special issue with Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord last year.\\n\\nDavos organizers, however, say they're ready to welcome Trump. According to Politico, forum organizers lobbied the administration for months to send high-level officials. No president has attended the forum since 2000.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump aides say the World Economic Forum offers him an opportunity to sell his message to an international crowd. The President welcomes opportunities to advance his America First agenda with world leaders, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Tuesday. At this year's World Economic Forum, the president looks forward to promoting his policies to strengthen American businesses, American industries and American workers."}
{"original": "Trump's decision to approve an airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's paramilitary Quds Force, came at a moment in his presidency when his national security team has been depleted by waves of departures and distracted by months of impeachment hearings before Congress.\\n\\nBut even before the Ukraine crisis, Trump had spent much of his first three years in office attacking critical capabilities ordinarily cultivated by commanders in chief: He has disparaged U.S. intelligence agencies, disrupted relationships with European partners and diluted the power of the bully pulpit with thousands of falsehoods.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo took to the airwaves on Jan. 5 to defend the airstrike that killed top Iranian military commander Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn many ways, Trump's approach to the presidency adds to the uncertainty of an increasingly volatile situation in the Middle East, with the administration deploying thousands of additional troops to the region even as Iran vows to take revenge with attacks on unspecified American targets.\\n\\nFormer U.S. national security officials described the situation as worrisome in part because of Iran's capabilities but also because of Trump's tendency to ignore advisers and favor instinct over hard information.\\n\\nFrom the death of a U.S. contractor, the siege of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to the killing of Qasem Soleimani. Shane Harris explains how the events unfolded. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThat's going to be a problem going forward if this situation deteriorates, said John McLaughlin, a former deputy director of the CIA. Trump and members of his Cabinet with critical roles in a potential conflict with Iran have two defining qualities, McLaughlin said: low credibility and limited experience.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo far, Trump appears to be leaning heavily on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for guidance on the decision to target Soleimani and the strike's aftermath, as well as making the public case that the operation was warranted.\\n\\nPompeo is the longest-standing member of Trump's inner circle, having served as CIA director before moving to the State Department. He is also regarded as a credible voice among conservatives, including in foreign policy circles otherwise skeptical of Trump.\\n\\nEven so, the administration's initial statements about the airstrike — including those made by Pompeo in a string of television appearances and calls to foreign counterparts — have at times been contradictory and greeted with skepticism.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a television interview on Friday, Pompeo repeatedly emphasized that the decision to target Soleimani was driven by U.S. intelligence assessments warning of imminent danger to American lives overseas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMembers of Congress emerged from private briefings with U.S. intelligence officials on Friday saying they heard nothing to suggest that the threat posed by the paramilitary forces led or guided by Soleimani had changed substantially in recent months.\\n\\nMore broadly, Pompeo asserted that the world is a safer place today, even as Americans were urged to evacuate from Iraq, and that the strike had decreased the chance of conflict with Iran, even as thousands of additional American troops were reportedly being rushed to the Middle East.\\n\\nPompeo's elevated standing in the Cabinet is in part a reflection of the stream of departures from the administration's upper ranks. Former defense secretary Jim Mattis, who served as a Marine general in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned a year ago. Trump has also gone through three national security advisers, including former lieutenant general Michael Flynn, former lieutenant general H.R. McMaster and John Bolton.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe current national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, stepped into the job in late September as the impeachment investigation was accelerating in the House. He is a lawyer who served in the U.S. Army Reserve with little known expertise on Iran or the Middle East.\\n\\nTurmoil within the National Security Council has further eroded critical areas of expertise, including counterterrorism, officials said.\\n\\nU.S. officials fear that Iran may seek to retaliate for Soleimani's death by using its networks of paramilitary proxies in Iraq and Syria, or its links to terrorist groups including Hezbollah. If so, coordinating the counterterrorism efforts of the CIA, FBI and other agencies could prove critical to safeguarding potential American targets.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the top counterterrorism official at the NSC was installed in the job late last year and has less experience than many of his predecessors. Kash Patel, a former aide to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), also has a strained relationship with the CIA and FBI, current and former officials said, in part because of his involvement in efforts by Trump and his allies to discredit those agencies and accuse them of seeking to undermine the president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has spent much of his presidency attacking U.S. spy agencies, rejecting their conclusions on critical national security issues ranging from Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election to the complicity of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\\n\\nAnd yet Trump and other officials have pinned the decision to target Soleimani on intelligence from the same agencies the president so frequently disparages. The risk of doing nothing was enormous, Pompeo said Friday on CNN. Intelligence community made that assessment and President Trump acted decisively last night.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn explaining his reluctance to trust U.S. spy agencies, Trump has often pointed to the erroneous assessments they made 17 years ago that Iraq had stockpiles of banned weapons — judgments cited by President George W. Bush as a rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose faulty prewar claims have had a lasting impact on American credibility in the Middle East and beyond. Trump's penchant for making false or exaggerated claims — something he has done more than 15,000 times while in office, according to a tally by The Washington Post — has likely compounded that credibility gap.\\n\\nMcLaughlin recalled a famous episode in the Cold War when President John F. Kennedy dispatched Dean Acheson, a former secretary of state, to Paris to brief French President Charles de Gaulle on the U.S. discovery of Soviet attempts to install missiles in Cuba.\\n\\nAcheson brought satellite images to show de Gaulle, but the French president — reportedly miffed that he was merely being informed about the development rather than consulted on any U.S. response — waved the photos away, saying that the word of the president was sufficient."}

That makes the snow amount forecast tough, and trying to figure out how officials will apply this forecast in their decision-making even tougher.\\n\\nSchoolCast\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA major complication is that the snow may be moving just when officials need to make a call very early Thursday. They'll want to closely monitor the radar and consult the best available weather information to make the best decision. It will be an easier decision if the snow breaks out on the early side, closer to 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., rather than 4 a.m.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, we think schools east of Interstate 95 have at least a 50-50 chance to have a snow day. There will be more snow there, and it will start earlier. But chances of a snow day drop quickly to the west, where snow will come in later, last a shorter amount of time and may not amount to much.\\n\\nWe realize some schools have yet to use any snow days this year, so maybe they'll be generous in their decision-making Thursday morning. In that case, these percentages may be conservative.\\n\\nFedCast\\n\\nWe think the prospect of snow falling on frozen roads during the morning commute may motivate OPM to issue an unscheduled leave policy to reduce traffic congestion.

{"original": "How many doses have been given out so far?\\n\\nIs there enough vaccine for everyone who is now eligible to get one?\\n\\nNo. Every state gets a new allotment of doses each week, and they have far fewer doses available than the number of people who qualify for them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe health departments make more appointments available every week as they get more doses from the federal government.\\n\\nWhich medical conditions will qualify residents for early coronavirus vaccines?\\n\\nIn Virginia, people with medical conditions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say are proven to increase the severity of coronavirus infections, including cancer, chronic kidney disease and certain heart conditions, are currently eligible for vaccinations. The Virginia Department of Health says many of those individuals will be offered the vaccine through their health care providers.\\n\\nIn Maryland, hospital patients who are receiving cancer treatment or hemodialysis, who have undergone a solid organ transplant or who suffer from COPD or Type 1 or 2 diabetes are all currently eligible for a vaccine. Those with illnesses who are not current hospital patients will become eligible later.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe District also is offering vaccinations to people 16 or older with serious health problems. Residents who have conditions such as cancer, diabetes or kidney or liver disease, or who have a body mass index of 30 or higher can seek a vaccine through their doctor or the city's public registration system.\\n\\nDo I have to get vaccinated in my state, or can I go to another state?\\n\\nAcross the region, some essential workers like health-care workers and teachers can get vaccinated in the state in which they work.\\n\\nWithin states, residents have been confused about whether they can get vaccinated in a county where they don't live. Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) announced Jan. 25 that her county's health officials are canceling appointments scheduled by Marylanders who don't live or work in the county, but mass vaccination sites including Six Flags in Prince George's remain open to all Marylanders.\\n\\nHow can I make an appointment or register to get a vaccine?\\n\\nD.C. residents who are eligible can sign up for a vaccination appointment here. In addition to the city's registration system, which allows eligible residents and workers to sign up for shots at retail pharmacies and other locations, the website also offers information about the many D.C. hospital systems that have their own registration systems for vaccinations. Eligible patients might want to try multiple registration systems. Children's National opened a waitlist for 16- and 17-year-olds with medical conditions who qualify for the vaccine. Only 200 spots will be available on the waitlist at a time; Diana Troese, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said new spots may open daily.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Wednesday, March 10, the city's revamped portal for vaccine appointments launched. It asks eligible residents to register once and then await an email with a link they can use to make an appointment. Once registrants are chosen to get a vaccine, they will be notified through a call, a text or an email and will need to book their appointment within 48 hours — or wait until they are selected again. Going forward, invitations will be sent out at 10 a.m. Thursdays and Sundays. Eligible individuals may also register over the phone. Forty percent of the initial portal appointments will be reserved for residents 65 and older, while another 40 percent will go to residents ages 18 to 64 with a qualifying medical condition. Twenty percent of appointments will go to essential workers. Half of all these appointments are reserved for people who live in priority Zip codes.\\n\\nMaryland residents who are eligible to get vaccinated can find a vaccination clinic here. Maryland residents may also need to contact multiple clinics from this map to find an appointment. The state plans to launch a centralized preregistration system in March for people to sign up for appointments at the state's mass vaccination sites.\\n\\nVirginia has created a new statewide registration system for residents to register for vaccine appointments. Residents can also call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA to register. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the state system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here. And those seeking to get vaccinated through CVS must still register through that pharmacy's website, which is not connected with the statewide system.\\n\\nWhat about mass vaccination sites?\\n\\nMaryland plans to open six, with four already launched and a fifth set to open March 25. All operate on an appointment-only basis for Maryland residents, but currently spots are extremely limited. The Six Flags site in Prince George's County accepts appointments for anyone who is eligible under state rules, regardless of where they live. The Baltimore Convention Center Field Hospital screens eligible residents and offers appointments based on age, illness and other factors. Appointments began at a third site — M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore — on Thursday, Feb. 25, and began at a fourth site — the Regency Furniture Stadium in Charles County — on March 4. Another site will be added in Hagerstown on March 25. More sites will be added in March if the state has received enough vaccine from the federal government.\\n\\nI'm a senior citizen. How do I get a vaccine?\\n\\nIn the District, senior citizens can sign up for appointments at vaccinate.dc.gov or can call 855-363-0333 to register by phone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome senior citizens in the District can also make a vaccine appointment through a hospital system or a health clinic, including Kaiser Permanente, Howard University, Sibley and George Washington University health systems and nonprofits including Mary's Center, Community of Hope, Bread for the City and more. Some appointments are open only to existing patients of those clinics, and some hospital appointments are open to all. The District provides links to all of the health-care providers giving shots here.\\n\\nIn Maryland, residents over 65 can find a vaccination clinic here. Montgomery County, which had been holding off vaccinating people ages 65 to 74 at its county-run clinics, began sending out vaccine registration links to certain essential workers and people 65 and older on March 3.\\n\\nIn Virginia, residents can use the state's new registration system to register for vaccine appointments, or call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here. And those seeking to get vaccinated through CVS must still register through that pharmacy's website, which is not connected with the statewide system.\\n\\nI'm a health-care worker or front-line essential worker. How do I get a vaccine?\\n\\nYou may be able to get vaccinated at your workplace. If not, follow the same steps described above for senior citizens if you work in the District or Virginia. If you work in Maryland, you should receive information about registering for a vaccine through your workplace.\\n\\nI'm not eligible yet. How can I find out when it's my turn to get a vaccine?\\n\\nIn Maryland, residents who are signed up for the state's emergency text alerts will get a text message each time the state starts vaccinating a new group. To sign up, send a text message to 898211 with the phrase MdReady.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVirginia residents can check their health departments' websites for more information on vaccine stages. (Click here for Virginia.)\\n\\nD.C. plans to make the remaining essential workers eligible in three groups. The first, starting on March 15, includes food service workers, postal and transit workers, and court staff and lawyers who must work in person currently. On March 29, journalists who must work in person currently and rideshare drivers become eligible. Construction workers, higher education workers who must work in person, and other remaining essential workers become eligible on April 12.\\n\\nThe District then plans to open vaccine eligibility to all residents age 16 and up on May 1, as President Biden has called for. This does not mean that there will be enough doses available to give every adult a shot that day, but any adult can seek a vaccine at that point.\\n\\nWhich groups will get vaccinated next?\\n\\nThe District and Virginia will next offer coronavirus vaccinations to additional groups of essential workers. Maryland will next offer doses to people ages 16 to 64 with certain health conditions, as well as more essential workers.\\n\\nWill I be notified when it's my turn to get a vaccine?\\n\\nNot automatically. Maryland residents can sign up for notifications by texting the phrase MdReady to the number 898211, and Loudoun County residents can text the number 888777 with the phrase LCCOVID19 to receive notifications in English or LCCOVIDESP to receive notifications in Spanish.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDistrict residents can sign up for its vaccine alert system here. Starting Wednesday, March 10, city residents will be able to sign up for D.C.'s revamped portal for vaccine appointments. It will ask eligible residents to register once and then await an email with a link they can use to make an appointment.\\n\\nVirginia's new statewide registration system will send out weekly reminders to residents that they are still in the queue. Fairfax County, which is opting out of the state's registration system, launched its own data dashboard, which allows people who signed up with that county to get more information about when they might get appointments.\\n\\nCan I volunteer to help out at a vaccination site?\\n\\nRight now, the D.C. Medical Reserve Corps is taking both medical and non-medical volunteers aged 18 and older on an as-needed basis. In Maryland, volunteers can sign up for the Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps. And Virginia has the Virginia Medical Reserve Corps. More volunteer opportunities may become available later as vaccinations continue to ramp up.\\n\\nAre pharmacies giving doses to anyone if they have extra doses left at the end of the day?\\n\\nA few lucky people have happened onto a shot this way, like law student David MacMillan, who recorded his experience in a TikTok video that went viral. McMillan and a friend were shopping at a Giant grocery store in Northeast Washington when a pharmacist offered to vaccinate them because she had an open vial of the vaccine that would otherwise be discarded and the store was closing soon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCould the same thing happen to you? It's extremely unlikely.\\n\\nThe D.C. health department does urge pharmacists to use doses on any available person rather than let them expire. However, hospitals and health centers have an on-call list of their own staff who are not front-line workers but who could get vaccinated if an extra dose needs to be used. Hanging out at your nearest pharmacy, or calling grocery stores, is not at all likely to get you a vaccination — and spending extra time in public places is a very bad idea if you're not vaccinated.\\n\\nBasically, if you're not an essential worker or in another prioritized group, the best thing to do is stay home and wait.\\n\\nAre coronavirus vaccinations free?\\n\\nYes. Under federal law, Americans won't pay for the vaccine."}

Caption We asked designers and shop owners for the proven winners. The Rose apartment sofa from Interior Define is good for someone with a small space and traditional taste ($1,200, interiordefine.com ). The English roll arm style makes it warmer than most of the urban-modern small-space sofas out there. Interior Define Wait 1 second to continue.\\n\\nBuying a sofa requires a strong knowledge of self, says Amy Rutherford, owner of furniture and home store Red Barn Mercantile in Alexandria. The first question I ask people is 'Where is it going?' Then, 'How do you use your space? What's your lifestyle like?'  If you like entertaining, you might go for a traditional shape, with rolled arms. If you live more casually, you might go with something slipcovered. Because sofas are such big purchases, they also require a lot of research and measurements. The width of the sofa needs to fit up or down any stairs, through the doorway and in the room itself. The height of the seat should be about the same as other seats in the room. And don't forget the depth, D.C. interior designer Byron Risdon says. Is it going to cut off a door or be in the way? Measure, measure, measure. Beyond size, there's fabric to choose, different cushion materials, different shapes — it can all get a little overwhelming.\\n\\nSo we asked five designers and shop owners to give us the skinny on their favorite sofas — ones they've touched, sat on or sourced for real homes. It's up to you and your tape measure to decide the right fit for you.\\n\\nKid- and pet-friendly\\n\\nI have this sofa . . . and I love it because it is so cozy, Rutherford says of Cisco Brothers' Seda, which her shop sells ($2,997, redbarnmercantile.com). I like putting up my feet and snuggling in the corner and reading a book or watching TV with my kids. She recommends it for a living room or family room and suggests that families choose a white denim slipcover for it. You pull it off, throw it in the wash, bleach it and throw it back on, she says.\\n\\n\\n\\nDean sofa, $1,799-$2,499. (Room and Board)\\n\\nWhen you have kids or pets, it's important to choose your sofa fabric wisely. Risdon favors furniture makers that understand this and points to Room & Board's 88-inch Dean sofa, which comes in indoor-outdoor Sunbrella fabric and performance fabric options ($1,799-$2,499, roomandboard.com). (If you have cats, pay attention to fabric weave, too. Large weaves don't play well with cat claws.) No matter what you choose, get a protective treatment, Risdon says, by a professional company such as Fiber-Seal.\\n\\nFor small spaces\\n\\n\\n\\nRose apartment sofa, $1,200. (Interior Define )\\n\\nIf you can't sit on a sofa before you buy it, designer and artist Kristin Try of Alexandria's Gingham & Grosgrain says you need to make sure the company you're buying from has great customer service. She chose the Rose apartment sofa from Interior Define, a company she likes, for a client with a small space and traditional taste ( $1,200, interiordefine.com.) The English roll arm style makes it warmer than most of the urban-modern small-space sofas out there.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlatiron gray apartment sofa, $799. (CB2)\\n\\nFor a recent grad or a working 20-something, interior designer Maureen Baker, based in New York with international firm Décor Aid, likes the Flatiron gray apartment sofa, with its single cushion and cool metal legs ($799, cb2.com). It also has slim arms, something that Risdon says will make it appear less obtrusive: If you live in a smaller apartment, having a sofa with slimmer lines makes it appear as if it's taking up less space.\\n\\nFor large spaces\\n\\n\\n\\nDryden two-piece sectional, $2,699. (Crate and Barrel)\\n\\nIf you have a big room to fill, by all means, go with a big sofa! (My biggest pet peeve is little tiny furniture in a big space, Rutherford says.) The sizable Dryden two-piece sectional is for a savvy buyer, Baker says — someone who is not ready to go custom, but has graduated from the Craigslist arena ($2,699, crateandbarrel.com). The sofa has a high-quality fill and the promise of a long life.\\n\\n\\n\\nClifton sectional, $5,140. (Mitchell Gold Bob Williams)\\n\\nIf you can't decide between modern and traditional, land in the middle with a transitional silhouette, as with the Clifton sectional (from $5,140 , mgbwhome.com). It could fit in a more traditional home with the right coffee table and chairs, but it's pretty contemporary and modern, Baker says. People are always looking for nice clean pieces, especially in upholstery, because it will be in style that much longer.\\n\\nSofa beds\\n\\n\\n\\nEliot sleeper sofa, $2,349-$6,099. (Joybird)\\n\\nRisdon looks to Joybird for apartment-friendly sofas that don't require a loan from Mom and Dad. The Eliot sleeper sofa comes in seven in-stock and 69 custom fabrics, plus leather options ($2,349- $6,099, joybird.com). The company has a return policy of 365 days, something Risdon notes is rare when it comes to buying large pieces of furniture but nice to have if you make a mistake with sizing. The company also offers a lifetime warranty and free delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\nYork guest sleeper sofa, $1,799-$1,899. (Room and Board)\\n\\nTry says the York guest sleeper sofa is the most comfortable sofa I've ever slept on. The comfort comes from a regular mattress plus an inflatable top layer ($1,799-$1,899, roomandboard.com). The sofa is really well made and looks good, too, she adds. One of her clients has the sectional version in a family room, and it has held up well to abuse from toddlers and a dog.\\n\\nBudget-friendly\\n\\nRisdon picked out Article's Cirrus as the perfect sofa for city folk. It comes in green, teal and gray velvet, which is a fun fabric for a loft, if not one with pets ($999, article.com). If you don't have kids or pets, then you're not worried about what's going to happen to a sofa. . . . You go with what makes you feel good, Risdon says. Delivery is a flat fee of $49.\\n\\n\\n\\nEddy, $799-$1,399. (West Elm )\\n\\nFor an affordable sofa you don't have to assemble, interior designer Lindsay Boudreaux of Alexandria's Shotgun Double design studio likes the Eddy from West Elm because of its clean lines and wooden legs ($799-$1,399, westelm.com). If $800 is still more than you have budgeted for a sofa, Baker suggests searching Craigslist and considering cost vs. benefit. Ask sellers about the size and age of a sofa, and add in the cost of renting a truck, if necessary.\\n\\nSplurge-worthy\\n\\n\\n\\nMadison sofa, $10,380. (Baker Furniture )\\n\\nBaker Furniture's Madison sofa is an heirloom piece, Boudreaux says (from $10,380, bakerfurniture.com). It is handcrafted in the U.S. with first-rate materials. The tuxedo-style sofa has been in Baker's line for decades and holds up against trends. As Rutherford says: You get what you pay for when you're buying a sofa. If you want to get eight-way, hand-tied [springs in your] sofa, you will pay for it, but you will have it for ages. It will be heirloom quality, and you will be passing it down to your children and they will want it.\\n\\n\\n\\nCloud track-arm leather two-seat-cushion sofa, $4,950-$9,250. (RH Modern)\\n\\nThat is an awesome sofa, Baker says of the Cloud track-arm leather two-seat-cushion sofa ($4,950-$9,250, restorationhardware.com). If you get a chance to go over to Restoration Hardware and sit on him, you'll never get up again. The double-doweled frame is built of kiln-dried hardwood, while the sofa cushions are made of luxurious goose feathers wrapped in down."}

The 25-year-old Adams is a native of New Zealand, where rugby is a brutal national pastime and the powerhouse national team, known as the All Blacks, reigns supreme.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEvery kid wants to grow up to be an All Black, Adams said. That's the whole country, mate.\\n\\nBefore Adams filled out into his burly 265-pound frame, he was, by his own account, a tall, scrawny and weak child who was overpowered and out-leveraged on the rugby pitch by shorter, stouter opponents. His rugby position, as in basketball, was unglamorous: He served as a lock, the rough equivalent of offensive lineman in American football. Locks form human walls to push as a unit during scrums, the sport's central conflicts which pit players without helmets against each other in violent struggles.\\n\\nIt's a beating, explained Adams, an expert on the subject of scrums given that he's drawn more fouls this year than all but six NBA centers. You can't see it all on TV, but guys are just going at it down in the trenches. If you watch the professionals, a dude will go in completely clean and come out with a broken nose.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe best part of the lock's job comes during line-outs, rugby's version of sideline inbounds plays. Adams's teammates would lift him multiple feet off the ground, utilizing his height to secure possession. Picture Russell Westbrook and Paul George boosting Adams into the air with their shoulders to complete an alley-oop.\\n\\nBut those highflying moments were too few and far between, and Adams shelved his rugby dreams in his early teens, concluding that his frame wasn't suitable. The Pacific Islanders are big boys, he said. I'm half-Poly [Polynesian], but you've got some full-blooded Polys out there who are built like crazy. An 8-year-old can be built like an 18-year-old with man strength. I learned very early that rugby wasn't my sport.\\n\\nAlthough Adams was hesitant to draw cross-sport comparisons from a technical or strategic standpoint, he said that the All Black mentality has cleanly transferred to his new profession. After hitting an early growth spurt and securing a basketball scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh, he brought his country's selfless, merciless ethos with him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe motto that sums up New Zealand is the 'No D---head' policy, Adams explained. Just don't be a d---head about anything. If the coach asks you to do something, do it. If you come home with a broken nose, thank you for your services. You did your job. I grew up [knowing the importance] of how hustle plays and gritty details make a successful outcome.\\n\\nAdams, who is averaging a career-high 15.3 points and 10.2 rebounds per game, has become one of the league's top big men, turning hustle plays into a $100 million contract. His bruising style and eccentric humor have made him a cult hero in New Zealand and Oklahoma City alike, and more than 261,000 fans have voted for him to make the all-star team, the third-highest tally among centers.\\n\\nWith Steve-O in the middle, Oklahoma City has transformed from a scoring juggernaut during the Kevin Durant years into a team whose defense carries its offense. At his preseason news conference, Thunder General Manager Sam Presti hailed Adams as a game-changer due to his All-Black type of focus on winning.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite a career-year from George and a third-straight triple-double season from Westbrook, the Thunder ranks 21st in offense and dead last in three-point percentage. Yet Oklahoma City (25-13) is among the West's best teams because of its No. 1 defense and No. 4 rebounding rate.\\n\\nThree-point shooting has not been great for us, Coach Billy Donovan said. We've got to find other ways to win. Being consistent with defensive rebounds and defending without fouling is a recipe for us to be the best version of ourselves.\\n\\nAs bigger names such as Durant and Carmelo Anthony have come and gone, Adams has become increasingly central to Oklahoma City's winning formula, serving as the offense's safety net and the defense's back line. He's also forged a close friendship with Westbrook, who once donned a fake mustache and arm-sleeve tattoo while dressing up as Adams for Halloween.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs a leader, I always want to know the person or the guy outside of basketball, Westbrook said. Everybody has a journey and a story. Where they like the ball on the court, that's irrelevant. Friendships and the brotherhood are most important.\\n\\nTo that end, Adams has introduced the Thunder to the All Blacks, inviting star T.J. Perenara to speak to his teammates in Oklahoma City in late November. The 26-year-old halfback offered a crash course in New Zealand's culture, writing on Instagram that he was completely blown away by the sporting exchange.\\n\\nAdams makes no secret of his fandom, wearing All Black jerseys in online photos and even kicking a rugby ball into a chair from 15 meters as part of a promotional challenge on YouTube. The Big Kiwi plans to watch Perenara and the All Blacks — his beloved meatheads — pursue their third straight Rugby World Cup title in the fall from the comfort of his local pub. Until then, he's focused on leaving his stamp on a Thunder team that reflects its center now more than ever.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe boys here understand all these small things have such a big impact, Adams said. This season is like another Christmas. The old ones are cool, but the new one is a bit dandier."}
{"original": "But history has shown any attempt to promote fair housing that does not actively work to destroy deeply ingrained systems of residential segregation will fail. Research has shown time and again that segregated housing is detrimental to all in our society. The residential segregation we see today is the result of decades of housing policy that benefited white home buyers to the exclusion of others. In such a highly segregated system and society, the rhetoric of freedom of choice does nothing to afford individuals actual choices.\\n\\nWe have seen Secretary Ben Carson's playbook before. In 1954, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City declared its public housing projects desegregated, by simply removing racial designations of white and Negro from them. This colorblind freedom of choice plan was easy to declare, and it absolved local authorities of responsibility for integration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWithout any structural support for integration, however, segregation remained in place. Those few projects that saw any racial change at all quickly flipped from being all-white to having all-black residents. That's because lower-class white Baltimoreans, accessing racially biased programs including federally insured home loans and GI Bill benefits, moved in droves to the suburbs.\\n\\nNew public housing projects, opened on an ostensibly desegregated basis, were primarily populated by black households. Simultaneously, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City blamed black families themselves for the lack of meaningful desegregation, claiming black residents were uninterested in moving to white areas. The color line remained stubbornly in place, even absent formal racial designations — giving people a choice of where to live in public housing in still deeply segregated neighborhoods did nothing to address it. Even 30 years later, three particular housing projects in the majority-black city still had 70 to 80 percent white residents.\\n\\nBut federal officials at HUD understood back then that declaring free choice was not the same thing as making it so. In a precursor to the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the department determined free choice housing policies, like the one in place in Baltimore, were allowing segregation to continue in public housing projects. New guidelines released in 1967 required local housing authorities to maintain systemwide waiting lists of applicants and assign tenants based on the order of application, rather than allowing white applicants to hold out for an opening in a majority-white housing project. HUD explained in a memo to housing authorities that freedom of choice plans did not afford freedom of choice in fact.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMoreover, HUD explained, placing the burden of desegregation on individuals without acknowledging how long-standing patterns of segregation affected the ability of individuals to make choices did not provide applicants with actual freedom of access to, or full availability of, housing in all projects and locations. Indeed, HUD recognized the long-standing history of segregated housing was in itself a major obstacle to freedom of choice.\\n\\nIn response to the policy changes, Baltimore housing officials reworked their plans. Still emphasizing choice, the housing authority skirted around the requirements. Instead of one wait list with applicants placed in projects as openings became available, Baltimore successfully lobbied to divide their housing projects into four geographic areas. In a highly segregated city like Baltimore, geographic areas could — and did — serve as a proxy for race.\\n\\nBaltimore's officials were successful in this end run around HUD policy because of their appeals to choice, insisting the policy as HUD originally envisioned would be an overreach into the lives of applicants that would force them to live in areas of the city that they did not prefer. In the face of this appeal to choice, HUD officials acquiesced to Baltimore's policy changes and accepted the division of the wait list into geographic areas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBaltimore's plans also used the results of residential segregation, including the racialized geography of proximity to family, churches, jobs and the familiar, as reasons to justify continuing such segregation. Despite HUD's attempted intervention, these new plans did as little to encourage integration as freedom of choice plans had done before. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, white public housing applicants could ensure placement in a white housing project by designating preference in the eastern group, where two projects had majority-white occupancy. If an applicant's employment necessitated living in the southern portion of the city, they could likewise specify a preference for proximity to the familiar to stay at the top of the wait list until an opening occurred in that area's majority-white project.\\n\\nThe idea that local housing officials needed to actively work to end residential segregation in all housing, public and private, became codified as law in the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Policymakers understood that simply removing the legal restraints of segregation would not produce desegregated housing.\\n\\nBut despite this law, it was only in 2015 under the Obama administration that HUD codified reporting requirements that required jurisdictions across the country to provide an Assessment of Fair Housing, using data to report on local housing segregation and develop plans with concrete, actionable steps to support fair housing opportunity. This rule recognized that the assumption that people make free choices unconstrained by structural inequality and systemic prejudices ignores the reality of how decisions are actually made. For those reasons, the 1968 Fair Housing Act required not only an end to segregation, but also affirmative supports for integration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis 2015 rule defined affirmatively furthering fair housing as taking meaningful actions that … address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns.\\n\\nBut now Carson has proposed a rule that would replace this definition. Rather than defining fair housing as a policy of active desegregation, the Trump administration emphasizes individual choice, even though we know that this is a policy dead end. Now the rule would focus on advancing fair housing choice within the program participant's control or influence. The rule also conflates desegregation with creating more affordable housing, replacing fair housing reporting and planning requirements with reports on the availability of affordable housing within a jurisdiction."}

Although Cameron did not identify the total amount of funding affected by the new policy, and the department declined to comment on the matter, Interior officials said it involves hundreds of millions of dollars.\\n\\nAn attachment to the directive listed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's Top Ten Priorities by which each award would be scrutinized. The list begins with Creating a conservation stewardship legacy second only to Teddy Roosevelt and includes Utilizing our natural resources.\\n\\nInterior spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an email Tuesday that the department had been reviewing grants and cooperative agreements totaling at least $100,000 since April and that the new guidance continued the responsible stewardship of tax dollars.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough Interior secretaries under Democratic and Republican presidents have directed federal dollars to support their priorities, the new approval process appears to be without precedent within the department.\\n\\nDavid J. Hayes, who served as Interior's deputy secretary under Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, said in an email Monday that laws passed by Congress govern these programs.\\n\\nSubjugating Congress' priorities to 10 of the Secretary's own priorities is arrogant, impractical and, in some cases, likely illegal, said Hayes, executive director of the New York University School of Law's State Energy and Environmental Impact Center.\\n\\nOur senior leadership team never set up a process like this — that is, a process that identifies broad categories of contracts, at modest financial levels, that must be kicked upstairs to headquarters for political sign-off, Hayes added. To the contrary, we recognized that government contract processes are complex, and that political interference would sully the integrity of contracting processes that applicants have a right to expect are governed with fairness, impartiality, and integrity as their guide.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCameron's memo warns, in a sentence that is bolded as well as italicized, that employees who defy the directive will be subject to even stricter oversight as a result.\\n\\nInstances circumventing the Secretarial priorities or the review process will cause greater scrutiny and will result in slowing down the approval process for all awards, it states.\\n\\nRep. Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, said in a statement that he would need to review the new system, but I'm immediately skeptical given the administration's track record.\\n\\nThis grant approval process looks like a backdoor way to stop funds going to legitimate scientific and environmental projects, he said. Using the federal grant process to punish scientists doing important work because they disagree with that philosophy is unacceptable, and there's good reason to think that's what's really happening here.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInterior has ordered the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine to halt two studies that conflict with the administration's goal of expanding domestic fossil fuel production.\\n\\nOfficials said they had questions about the studies' expense to taxpayers. One, stopped in August, was looking at whether residents near surface coal mining sites in Appalachia face higher health risks than other Americans. The second, suspended last month, was aimed at updating and enhancing the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's oil and gas inspection program.\\n\\nSwift did not identify how many grants, or which ones, had been canceled as a result of the earlier review. She said it was too early to say how many awards would now come under scrutiny since the guidance is so new."}
{"original": "It was random. I wasn't expecting it. I wasn't going to be eligible for the vaccine for months, said MacMillan, a 31-year-old law student and employee at a law firm. I figured July.\\n\\nWithin minutes, MacMillan and his friend were inoculated, providing them a route out of the pandemic. MacMillan plans to head back to the pharmacy Jan. 29 for the second dose of a vaccine that studies show is better than 90 percent effective against the virus, which has killed more than 359,000 people in the United States, according to data compiled by The Washington Post.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI feel like I've used up all my luck for the year on the first day, MacMillan said. But that's one fewer person who can spread it to other people.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo one expected a perfectly smooth rollout of two new vaccines to hundreds of millions of people, an endeavor that has been hindered by delays in its first few weeks. But the campaign also is bringing good fortune to a few lucky souls such as MacMillan, who find themselves serendipitously in the path of unused doses of the vaccine.\\n\\nThe two authorized vaccines, made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, must be used within six hours after being removed from subzero storage and reaching room temperature. Otherwise, they must be discarded.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Pfizer medication is diluted before use, another factor that affects its window of usefulness. Moderna's product comes in 10-dose vials, while Pfizer's vaccine is contained in five-dose bottles.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith a disease-weary nation awaiting deliverance, the workers distributing vaccines are trying not to waste a single drop.\\n\\nSo when an overnight refrigeration failure in Ukiah, Calif., jeopardized 600 doses, officials there found themselves with two hours Monday to distribute the vaccine or lose those doses. The vaccine quickly went to jail guards, an elder-care facility, firefighters and others across Mendocino County.\\n\\nWithin 90 minutes, Ukiah fire chief Doug Hutchison said, more than 100 people in the city were vaccinated, including Hutchison and most of the fire department's 16 members.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThough the firefighters are all paramedics, part of California's top tier of vaccine recipients, Hutchison, 52, had expected to be immunized in late January. Fate moved him up about a month.\\n\\nHutchison said he feels some remorse over receiving the vaccine ahead of a few of his firefighters who were not available that day. But it's better that it got utilized, and then we can get it out to the community, he said in an interview Wednesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt medical centers, where front-line health-care providers have been vaccinated since nurse Sandra Lindsay received the first shot Dec. 14, it's difficult to avoid having a few extra doses at the end of each day. Caregivers occasionally miss appointments, or a few doses are left over from vials of five and 10, officials said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith little guidance from the government, hospitals are working out their own policies. The Mayo Clinic system, headquartered in Rochester, Minn., offers extra doses first to workers in the emergency department and covid-19 units, according to Melanie D. Swift, co-leader of the health system's vaccination plan. After that, vaccinators are offered a shot.\\n\\nRunning out of unvaccinated arms, Mayo is now piloting a 'last minute list' where people who are scheduled for vaccination at a future date can sign up if they are available to be vaccinated during the last hour of the vaccination clinic, Swift said in a statement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA spokeswoman said the system administers about one to three doses per day this way.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt Yale New Haven Health, the system's hospitals also keep a list of those already signed up but who are flexible with appointment timing, so that if extra doses remain at any point or there is a no-show, one of those employees is notified and vaccinated, spokeswoman Dana Marnane said in an email. To date, she said, 14,500 Yale health-care providers have been immunized.\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration's formal policy remains to discard vaccine left over in vials, the agency said, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determining who should receive vaccine. The CDC did not respond to a request for comment. Neither Pfizer nor Moderna has a policy on unused vaccine.\\n\\nBut Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, urged officials Wednesday not to be hamstrung by federal priorities that call for health workers and residents and employees of elder-care facilities to be first in line.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's more important to get people vaccinated than to perfectly march though each prioritized group, Azar said at a briefing on the vaccination effort.\\n\\nIn MacMillan's case, the pharmacist was following policy set by the District of Columbia, according to Felis Andrade, a spokesman for Giant Foods.\\n\\nSome vaccine has been administered outside the bounds of intended policy. On Saturday, word got out that a health-care clinic in Austin was distributing vaccine and some people scrambled to get in line, according to the Austin American-Statesman.\\n\\nOne was Betsy Christian, who, according to the article, posted on Facebook: OK, judge me. Daughter, spouse and I got the vaccine today. We have no underlying conditions, aren't elderly and aren't front-line workers. She said the father of her daughter's roommate had told them that the extra vaccines would go bad if not used today.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe felt bad taking someone's place but the vaccines would have gone to waste. Are we rationalizing? she added, according to the article.\\n\\nThose posts are no longer public, and Christian and her husband did not return telephone calls from The Post.\\n\\nHeidi Shalev, a spokeswoman for Austin Regional Clinic, told the American-Statesman that once word got out, there were so many people standing in line that we wanted to get everybody through and we wanted to use every vial of vaccine that we had. We wanted to make sure none went to waste. We did learn that a sign-up process in the future is something that we'll do.\\n\\nMacMillan, who memorialized his vaccination on TikTok, said, Maybe if there was more time, I would've said, 'Isn't there someone who needs this more than me?' \\n\\nBut he said he had escaped his upbringing in a fundamentalist, anti-government, anti-vaccination community that later was the subject of a documentary, and he welcomed the opportunity to show that the vaccinations are safe. The side effects were mild, he said.\\n\\nTalk about a great way to start 2021!! he wrote on TikTok."}
{"original": "On Monday, McCain, a new mother, returned to her co-hosting slot on The View for the first time since giving birth last fall. She'd planned to come back before the election, she explained, but unexpected medical complications kicked my butt and doubled her time out of the office.\\n\\nThe extension prompted a lightbulb moment: As I thought about it, the more angry I got that there weren't women in the rest of America that had the same kind of luxury that I had, she said. It takes personal experience sometimes to get on board.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut now that she was fully onboarded, she had a request for her co-hosts: The women of The View should make paid maternity leave their 2021 mission. They should put [politicians'] feet to the fire — especially members of McCain's own Republican Party who pay lip service to family values — to make paid maternity leave a legislated guarantee.\\n\\nMcCain is, of course, completely correct. Among the world's 41 wealthiest countries, the United States is the only one that doesn't mandate paid leave — leagues behind top-ranking Estonia, Hungary and the other countries that offer more than a year. Paid parental leave is good for families, good for children and good for working parents, and America's failure on this matter is so self-evident that we don't need to spend more than this one paragraph emphasizing it. Meghan McCain is one thousand percent right.\\n\\nWhat I'm most interested in is how she got there. Or rather, why it took her so long to get there. Or rather, how we can speed up this process so that it doesn't require every leave-denier to personally birth a child before they also get on board.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWould McCain now support leave if she'd had an easy, complication-free labor? She seemed to be arguing for Congress to specifically support the amount of time she herself had taken: three months. What if she'd recovered after only 10 weeks? Would that then be her policy recommendation? Or conversely, what if her postpartum experience had been even more trying or if she'd lacked the support system of the husband and mother-in-law she said she relied on? Would she be asking the women of The View to stump for four months of paid leave? Five?\\n\\nWhen co-host Sara Haines suggested that paid leave shouldn't just be for mothers — Dads also need that time, with the modern family structure changing — McCain politely shot her down. I do think we should start with the mother, she said.\\n\\nPersonal experiences can be powerful and life-altering. But the trouble with policies guided by the personal struggles of famous TV personalities is that they are not based on what average citizens need or what experts determine is optimal. They are based on the solipsism of influential people who are scandalized only by injustices that they experience personally.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou saw this with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who only began to support same-sex marriage when his son came out as gay. Or with Jared Kushner, who decided to make criminal justice reform a signature issue because of his father's experiences being convicted and imprisoned for illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and witness tampering. Chris Christie — who, incidentally, had prosecuted Charles Kushner as New Jersey's attorney general — recently filmed a video begging his constituents to wear masks, but only after he'd contracted the coronavirus after attending a White House ceremony, maskless.\\n\\nYou see it when daughters support universal health care only after their fathers are diagnosed with cancer, or when fathers support access to abortion only when their daughters need one.\\n\\nIt's funny, McCain's co-host Whoopi Goldberg replied to McCain, in a tone that did not sound amused, it sounded as if she were reminding herself not to pummel a colleague on national television. We've been fighting for this for years. Begging. Screaming.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNevertheless, Goldberg nodded along to McCain's request, as did the other co-hosts. Of course they were on board with holding politicians' feet to the fire on this issue. They had been doing so for a long time.\\n\\nGentleness is the only constructive response. Of course we need to applaud people when they change their minds, of course we need to welcome them wholeheartedly to the team, of course we need to bite our tongues when they discover 40-year-old talking points, of course we need to recognize that someone like McCain might be a more resonant voice for conservative viewers than liberals like Goldberg or Joy Behar. Righteously scolding latecomers is gratifying but counterproductive to the cause — a self-centered move in its own right.\\n\\nEmpathy is a muscle. It would do all of us good to strengthen it, and that means not just reflecting on our experiences but exercising our imaginations. Imagine a terrible thing happening to you, and how you would like to be treated in the aftermath; now recognize that the terrible thing already happens to thousands of Americans every day. The goal is not to walk a mile in someone else's shoes; the goal is to recognize that someone else's shoes may never fit you and yet they still deserved to be warm and dry.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt should not take a difficult childbirth/a gay son/a wife with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma/a transgender parent to realize that medical bankruptcy or discrimination are terrible, dehumanizing things. People deserve empathy not because we see our own suffering in theirs but because they are people who are suffering.\\n\\nAnd if a personal experience does bring a specific experience of suffering into focus, have the humility to outsource your ideas about what needs to be done to experts and activists who have thought and cared about the terrible thing for longer than you have.\\n\\nMeghan McCain's realization about the necessity of universal parental leave is wonderful, and I'm grateful for it. I'm eager to see her try to hold politicians' feet to the fire. And I expect that in doing so, she might have another realization: That it's frustrating to try to persuade people to care about an injustice when they haven't suffered through it themselves."}
{"original": "The White House may be in chaos. But at least Congress is addressing the issue Americans care about most: making it easier for the finance industry to rip them off.\\n\\nLast week, Jeb Hensarling (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, circulated an outline of his latest plan to repeal Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank, you may recall, was put in place after the financial crisis to reduce our chances of having another one.\\n\\nThe law isn't perfect, but it did have at least one critical, mostly popular component: It created an agency dedicated solely to helping consumers fight back when financial institutions cheat or mislead them.\\n\\nThis agency is called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). It oversees large banks, thrifts and credit unions, along with lots of companies in the nonbank universe, such as mortgage brokers and servicers, payday lenders, debt collectors, private student lenders and credit bureaus.\\n\\nWhile the CFPB may not have the same name recognition as, say, the Federal Reserve, many of its actions have generated big headlines.\\n\\n(The Washington Post)\\n\\nRemember when Wells Fargo got caught creating millions of fake customer accounts? The bureau helped lead that investigation, which resulted in a $185 million settlement.\\n\\nThe bureau has also, among other things, sued pension-advance companies that fleece veterans, and it ordered the firms that left low-income users of prepaid RushCards unable to access their own money to pay $13 million in restitution and fines.\\n\\nIn its five years of existence, the bureau says it has recovered $11.7 billion for more than 27 million consumers.\\n\\nThe financial industry, understandably, is not super keen on this independent federal agency. And neither is Hensarling, who — just coincidentally? — has received generous campaign contributions from the finance industry.\\n\\nHensarling's leaked memo lays out updates to legislation he introduced last year (which, among other things, required that CFPB employees be paid less than their counterparts at other federal financial regulatory agencies).\\n\\nUnder the Orwellian section heading Empowering Americans to Achieve Financial Independence, the memo explains how Hensarling intends to further disempower this agency — and by extension, American consumers.\\n\\nFor instance, the CFPB director would become an at-will political appointee. This means that — unlike the officials who run the Fed, Federal Trade Commission or Securities and Exchange Commission — the CFPB director could be fired without cause. The bureau would cease to be an independent agency and could be pressured at any time to drop investigations of, say, friends of the president.\\n\\nAccording to the memo, Hensarling also plans to repeal the CFPB's supervisory powers. This is a fancy way of saying the bureau would no longer have the right to kick the tires and look under the hood — that is, to regularly examine what's going on inside the institutions it regulates to make sure they're following the law.\\n\\nEven more disturbing, the bureau would no longer be allowed to punish firms that cheat their customers. At most, it could tell the firms to please stop cheating (or else!).\\n\\nYes, you heard that right. No more fines and no more penalties. It's not even clear from Hensarling's memo that the bureau could force firms to return any money they've already pinched from consumers.\\n\\nIn such a world, why not grab as much as you can?\\n\\nWe don't know exactly how the bullet points in this memo will get translated into legislation. (A spokeswoman for the House Financial Services Committee declined to comment on the memo.) But it seems likely that consumer protections would wind up even weaker than they were before the crisis.\\n\\nThat's because Dodd-Frank took the authority to enforce some consumer protection laws away from other regulators and gave them to the newly formed CFPB. Assuming those authorities aren't being re-delegated to these other agencies — and the memo does not indicate that will happen — they'll remain with a bureau that's essentially powerless to enforce them.\\n\\nOf course, many of these policy changes make sense if your worldview is that government should stay out of private transactions because consumers are smart enough to fend for themselves. Which brings me to the weirdest and least defensible parts of Hensarling's plan: an effort to make consumers dumber.\\n\\nHensarling's memo not only strips the CFPB of most supervisory and enforcement powers; it also eliminates the bureau's research functions, its public database of consumer complaints (so much for transparency) and even its consumer education functions. Right now, the bureau publishes educational materials on its website and partners with libraries, veterans groups and other community organizations.\\n\\nIt's hard to imagine what legitimate public interest lies in killing efforts to promote financial literacy. But in the con-man economy, maybe public interest is no longer a consideration."}

{"original": "The Interior Department aims to mitigate any negative environmental impacts in transparent ways that follow federal law and are consistent with direction provided by Congress with a level of certainty to all involved parties, the order states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile the documents are highly technical, the move underscores the extent to which Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his deputies are uprooting policies and procedures aimed at factoring climate and environmental effects into the department's decision-making.

He singled out the practice at a speech before the Western Governors Association in June.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome people would call it extortion, Zinke said of a power line company's having to pay a huge fee to offset its project's impact, according to an audio recording of the session. I call it un-American.\\n\\nInterior spokeswoman Heather Swift wrote in an email Friday that when it came to the order, I don't think it's unusual for a new administration to put in place their own policies that achieve their missions. The Obama administration's policies reduced predictability, created conflicts, and unnecessarily increased permitting [and] authorization timelines.\\n\\nJim Lyons, who served as Interior's deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals management under the Obama administration, said in an interview that revoking these policies will undermine the kind of landscape-scale conservation espoused by scientists and many policymakers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThey're determined to lease and develop every acre they possibly can, which will minimize the potential for conserving these landscapes in subsequent administrations, said Lyons, who is now a senior fellow at the liberal think tank Center for American Progress and a lecturer at Yale University.

Several oil and gas groups, including the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the American Petroleum Institute and the American Exploration & Production Council, will submit comments Friday asking for the policy to be revoked on the grounds that it prioritizes conservation objectives over other uses of public land."}
{"original": "The new legislation, called the Tibetan Policy and Support Act (TPSA), appears deep in the 5,000-plus-page law and has drawn attention for weighing in on the current Dalai Lama's reincarnation, one of the few instances the Buddhist concept has been mentioned in U.S. law.\\n\\nThe unusual religious language, however, is not an example of U.S. legislators pontificating on the Tibetan religion, said Bhuchung K. Tsering, vice president of the International Campaign for Tibet, which helped congressional leaders frame the legislation. Rather, the clauses on reincarnation are aimed at preserving Tibet's cultural and political distinctiveness.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy adding new provisions to the 2002 Tibet act, the new bill institutionalizes two decades of developments in U.S. policy on Tibet, Tsering said.\\n\\nLike much else in the massive spending bill, the TPSA began as an independent piece of legislation but was added into the stimulus package after languishing on Capitol Hill because of the reduced legislative schedule caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nThe most significant provision of the TPSA instructs the State Department to deny China any new consulates in the United States until a U.S. Consulate is established in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.\\n\\nIt also addresses environmental issues, particularly Tibet's water security after China restricted the flow of key rivers in recent years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe bill's concern with reincarnation is similarly aimed at reining in Beijing. Traditionally the successor to the Dalai Lama has been determined by a group of disciples close to the previous holder of the title, who seek the reborn person of the Dalai Lamai after his death. But the Chinese government has indicated it may name its own Dalai Lama, in hopes of controlling his statements and teachings.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn 1995, the government kidnapped the second-highest Buddhist spiritual figure, the Panchen Lama, when he was 6. He and his family have not been seen since.\\n\\nThe new TPSA provides for sanctions on Chinese Communist Party officials if they attempt to name a successor to the Dalai Lama, and it urges international coordination to quash recognition of any Dalai Lama picked by Communist Chinese leaders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Tsering said the effect of the new bill goes beyond threatening gestures. Americans have long been interested in Tibet, he said, but the growing constituency of Tibetan Buddhist believers, including immigrants from Tibet, has given the United States more standing to object to how China treats Tibet.\\n\\nChina has long fended off outside criticism of its treatment of Tibet by claiming it was a domestic matter. What this bill is now saying, Tsering said, is that Tibet is very much an American issue."}

{"original": "Given the stakes — both for students and the budget — it is important for policymakers and the general public to understand the effects of different forgiveness options. Many economists have already pointed out that loan forgiveness would disproportionately help people on the upper end of the earning scale: Two scholars with the Brookings Institution, for instance, note that 60 percent of educational debt is owed by households in the top 40 percent of earners — those, that is, with an annual income of $74,000 or more. This skew is hardly surprising, as many Americans do not go to college and only a fraction go to graduate or professional schools. And those who do go to college earn substantially more, in part thanks to the degree: Over their lifetime, the median couple with two bachelor's degrees earns $1.8 million more than the median couple with two high school diplomas.\\n\\nBut our research finds that loan forgiveness would benefit upper-income people even more than is generally understood. That's partly because few realize that a large loan forgiveness program for low-income borrowers already exists: Many low-income borrowers are already enrolled in income-driven repayment plans that not only peg payments to wage levels but forgive loans after some period, typically 20 or 25 years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo get a better sense of who benefits from loan forgiveness, we analyzed data from a 2019 survey of consumer finances conducted by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, including 5,777 households. Using the present value of loans (which lowers the figure if part of the loan is eventually likely to be forgiven) changes the picture, we found: If a comprehensive loan-forgiveness program were passed, we calculate that the average person in the top 10 percent of earners would receive $5,944 in forgiveness, while the average individual in the bottom 10 percent of earners would receive $1,070.\\n\\nThat average includes both borrowers and non-borrowers, as well as college dropouts. (The average loan size for the 845 borrowing households in the sample is $41,400, with wealthier families owing more.)\\n\\nOverall, households in the top 30 percent of the earnings distribution would receive almost half of all the dollars forgiven. To put it even more starkly: Erasing all federal student debts would benefit the top 10 percent of earners just as much as the bottom 30 percent combined. Those calculations are for wiping away all debt, but forgiveness is even more regressive if it is limited to $10,000 or $50,000.\\n\\nIt's important to understand the distributional consequences of a $1.6 trillion debt jubilee before a decision is made in part because erasing college debt won't reduce the average debt of Americans. Rather, it will transfer private liabilities to the general public by increasing the federal debt. The long-run consequence will be an increase in taxes or a decrease in public spending. The redistributional effects will be immediate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEven though income-driven repayment plays are underutilized — some borrowers don't know about them — roughly half of people with student debt are in such plans. A typical IDR program requires that a borrower pay 15 percent of any discretionary income — defined as income above 150 percent of the poverty line. After 20 or 25 years, the balance is forgiven, regardless of the amount due.\\n\\nTo see how this plays out, compare two theoretical borrowers in an income-driven repayment plan: Lara and Tonya. A single mom living with two kids, Lara earns $50,000. Under the most recent IDR rules, her payments — regardless of loan size — would not exceed $1,742 per year. Assuming that interest accrues at 4 percent, and that she is 15 years away from forgiveness, Lara will fully repay her loan only if her balance is at or below $19,400. After that, any remaining debt will be forgiven; it makes no difference whether she borrowed $20,000 or $50,000.\\n\\nAs a result, Lara doesn't benefit much from the $10,000 in loan forgiveness that Biden proposes. If she happens to owe $28,400, and $10,000 is forgiven, thereby dropping her balance to $18,400, she will save $1,000. If she owes more than $29,400, she won't benefit from debt forgiveness at all — she'll end up paying the same proportion of her income for 15 years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tonya, a married mother of one, owes $50,000 and earns twice as much as Lara, $100,000. Tonya would pay $6,742 annually, under an income-driven repayment plan. Because her higher income lets her pay off her entire loan, she would benefit from every dollar of forgiveness the government provides.\\n\\nToo much of the debate over student-loan forgiveness has focused on reducing the nominal balances without considering whether they are on track to be repaid. Our analysis suggests some policy alternatives: Nudging more people into income-driven repayment plans would achieve more forgiveness for low-income borrowers, for instance. So would making those plans more generous.\\n\\nWe looked at what would happen if every borrower who would benefit from an income-driven repayment plan were put into one — specifically, a plan that required a 10 percent payment for all income above 150 percent of the poverty line, and forgave loans after 20 years (the terms of the more generous current plans). In that case, people in the bottom decile of earners would get four times the amount of debt forgiveness as those in the top decile. The bottom half of earners would get more than half the gains.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe middle of the income curve would also get more help than under universal forgiveness: People from the 40th to 80th percentile would get nearly 70 percent of the benefits.\\n\\nMaking IDR plans more generous could also lead to more forgiveness for low earners. We calculate what would happen if the IDR threshold were increased from 150 percent to 300 percent of the poverty line. (In other words, no repayment until someone made three times poverty wages.) Such a policy would benefit the bottom third of borrowers more than would blanket forgiveness of $50,000 in debt, we found. Yet, the overall cost to taxpayers would be nearly three times smaller because it would barely reduce the payment of high earners."}
{"original": "But some provisions present potential business pitfalls. The bill would generally provide less financial support to lower-income people who currently sign up for insurance through the exchanges. That could create big problems for insurers if it deters people — especially healthy people — from buying coverage, as insurers depend on a mix of healthy and sick people to keep their plans profitable and premiums affordable.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd the bill wouldn't affect all health insurances companies equally. Many large insurers have pulled back from offering plans on the laws exchanges, leaving them less exposed to future risks.\\n\\nMario Molina, the chief executive of Molina Healthcare, a small insurer that is a big player in both the Medicaid market and the exchanges, said that the bill does not inspire confidence.\\n\\nThe present bill, in the current form, doesn't do much to reassure this is a long-term, viable insurance product, Molina said. I'm actually more concerned about Medicaid and what this is going to do to our safety net.\\n\\nThe bill would preserve much of the status quo until 2020, when the Affordable Care Act's financial assistance to consumers would be replaced by age-based tax credits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow the tax credit plays out will be critical, said Elizabeth Carpenter, a senior vice president at Avalere Health. The change in the tax credit amount may cause some individuals — especially at the lower end of the income scale — to have to pay more for premiums and make coverage unaffordable. From an insurance company's perspective, who continues to buy insurance is critical.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere's more of what companies wanted, and what they got:\\n\\n1) Elimination of taxes\\n\\nInsurers wanted the health insurance tax repealed. Drug companies wanted the prescription drug tax repealed. Medical device makers wanted to kill an excise tax. Big employers wanted to abolish the Cadillac tax, a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost employer health plans. With the exception of the Cadillac tax — which was previously delayed to 2020 and now will be been delayed to 2025 — they all got what they wanted.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAn analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that, over a decade, repealing the health insurer tax would cost $145 billion; repealing the prescription drug tax would cost $25 billion; repealing the medical device tax would cost $20 billion; delaying the Cadillac tax would cost $49 billion.\\n\\nStill, companies are pushing for the Cadillac tax to be scrapped entirely, instead of the current delay.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe delay is better than current law, said James Gelfand, senior vice president of health policy at the ERISA Industry Committee, a lobbying group that represents large companies. Now is the chance, and this is the bill that must completely eradicate the Cadillac tax.\\n\\n2) A replacement for the individual mandate that will encourage healthy people to sign up for insurance\\n\\nHealth insurers need both healthy and sick people to sign up for insurance to have a balanced risk pool. This was a major problem in the Affordable Care Act exchanges, where too many healthy people were willing to pay a fine rather than sign up for insurance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInstead of a mandate and a fine if people don't sign up for insurance, the bill would create a continuous coverage requirement that would penalize people who have a gap in their coverage. Anyone who lets their insurance coverage lapse could experience a 30 percent premium hike the next time they sign up.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne possibility is that people will be incentivized to avoid any gaps in coverage, to avoid that 30 percent premium surcharge. But here's another scenario: A young, healthy person lacks coverage. She goes to sign up, but she faces a penalty that would make her plan more expensive. Why not just wait until she really needs insurance, since she'll be paying the penalty either way? In contrast, sick people who need insurance are more likely to pay the penalty.\\n\\nMolina argued the requirement could result in confusion and more gaming of the system — he questioned how it would even work logistically, with insurance companies researching whether people had been continuously covered or issuing some certificate that people had coverage ending at a certain date. And, he said, the premium hikes still wouldn't cover the cost of people who are really waiting until they are sick to sign up — on average, he said those members cost about twice as much as a normal member, not 30 percent more.\\n\\n3) Help providing affordable coverage\\n\\nThe bill would replace the premium tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies in the Affordable Care Act with a flat tax credit, based on age. Currently, only people who make between 138 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty limit are eligible for tax credits that defray their premiums. The size of the credits are pegged to people's incomes and the cost of a benchmark plan in the marketplace where they're buying insurance. That helps account for the fact that the average premium can vary widely depending where a person is buying insurance.\\n\\nThe new tax credit would gradually peter out for people who make more than $75,000 a year or $150,000 for a couple, but it ignores the fact that care costs more in different geographical regions or that someone who makes $20,000 a year might be more strained in trying to buy an insurance plan with the same amount of financial help as someone who makes $74,000. The graph below shows how a flat tax credit would do little to defray the monthly cost of insurance in markets where health insurance is more expensive.\\n\\n4) Continued support for subsidies that help people pay for insurance in the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces\\n\\nThe insurance industry has been clear that it wants a stable transition, meaning that subsidies that help people pay for their insurance premiums shouldn't be abruptly yanked out from underneath them. The bill keeps in place those tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that help lower the out-of-pocket costs for people based on their income — until 2020.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMolina, however, said that since the money hasn't been appropriated yet, he fears that Congress could stop funding the cost-sharing reductions as early as May.\\n\\nWith the possible lost of the cost-sharing reductions, I think insurers will probably raise their prices as much, if not more than they did this year, Molina said. I wouldn't be surprised if we see rate increases and more plans dropping out.\\n\\n5) More flexibility in the ability to design health coverage benefits\\n\\nInsurers requested fewer rules, regulations and red tape. The draft bill takes steps toward easing insurers' ability to design health coverage, but leaves in place the 10 categories of essential health benefits that must be covered.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInsurers currently charge more to people based on their age, but current rules limit the spread to three times the costs of the youngest group of insured people. The bill would allow them to charge five times as much to older people. It also does away with a requirement that plans offer products with a specific value — a provision that created bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans that were progressively more expensive.\\n\\nIn general, plans would like flexibility to design a product to meet the needs of their consumers in a particular market, and certainly getting rid of those tiers is one way to increase flexibility for plans, Carpenter said."}
{"original": "1. How did the dispute begin?\\n\\nThe crisis was sparked in 2017 when hackers published a story on Qatar's news agency quoting Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani as criticizing mounting anti-Iran sentiment after a trip to the region by U.S. President Donald Trump. Qatari officials quickly deleted the comments, called the FBI to help investigate the hack, and appealed for calm as Saudi and UAE newspapers and clerics accused Qatar of trying to undermine efforts to isolate Iran. On June 5 that year, the Saudi- and UAE-led bloc cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. At the time, there were expectations that the rulers would resolve the spat quietly among themselves, as they did a similar dispute three years earlier. Instead, the group issued tough demands, Qatar refused to bend, and the breach hardened.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2. What's the rift about?\\n\\nThe quartet complains about Qatar's friendliness with Iran and accuses it of supporting al-Qaeda and Islamic State terrorists, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organization that several Gulf states have banned and designated as a terrorist group. Qatar's leaders vehemently deny supporting terrorism and have argued that adhering to the bloc's demands would infringe the country's sovereignty.\\n\\n3. How has the division spread?\\n\\nRivalry between Qatar and its neighbors gas extended beyond the Persian Gulf. The countries find themselves on either side of a proxy war in Libya. Qatar has drawn closer to Turkey, which helped it weather the initial shock of the embargo. Meanwhile, Turkey's ties to other Gulf states have soured; for example, the country has deployed troops to fight against UAE-backed forces in Libya, and it released information implicating Saudi agents in the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n4. How much damage has been done?\\n\\nIn 2016, the last full year before the embargo, Qatar's trade with the UAE amounted to $3.5 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund, while trade between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Egypt totaled about $3.3 billion. That's vanished. So too have virtually all tourists visiting Qatar from the boycotting countries: 1.3 million people in 2016, including three of the top five visiting nationalities. The decline in intra-Gulf business contributed to a slide in real estate prices and has weighed on economic growth. Still, Qataris argue that the embargo has helped them forge new business ties and foster emerging industries, especially food production, that the country wouldn't have otherwise developed. It touted these moves while dealing with supply chain disruptions amid the spread of coronavirus.\\n\\n5. How widespread is the fallout?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe rift has not just hurt Qatar. The boycotting states, particularly the UAE, lost tourists and investors from Qatar and the dispute shook confidence in regional business hub Dubai, which many companies use as a base for their Gulf and wider Middle East operations. In the U.K., Qatari broadcaster BeIN even tried to block a consortium that included Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund from buying soccer club Newcastle United; the sovereign wealth fund ultimately abandoned the bid. More widely, the U.S. voiced concern that the row had complicated security cooperation in a region that hosts major U.S. bases and is a significant exporter and route for global oil supplies. Washington also sees unity among Persian Gulf states as essential to combating the influence of its foe Iran, which U.S. officials view as having benefited from the divisions.\\n\\n6. Was it all a misunderstanding?\\n\\nNo. The conflict had been brewing for years. With its oil riches and custodianship of Islam's holiest sites, Saudi Arabia has long seen itself as the natural leader of the Gulf region, if not the entire Middle East. Its strongest competitor is Iran, with whom it has a testy relationship. Since Qatar began to grow wealthy from natural gas exports two decades ago, it has asserted its independence from the Saudis and sought cordial ties with Iran, with whom it shares a gigantic offshore gas field. At stake: almost 50 trillion cubic meters of proven gas reserves, according to Qatar Energy Minister Saad Sherida Al Kaabi. In the meantime, Israel made peace deals with the UAE and Bahrain in 2020, underscoring that it's now Iran — rather than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — that's the focus of the region's geopolitical disputes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n7. Does Qatar support al-Qaeda and Islamic State?\\n\\nSome Qataris have provided support to al-Qaeda and its spinoffs, but the country says it has stepped up efforts to clamp down on terrorism financing, particularly since 2017. The U.S. State Department's 2018 report on terrorism said Qatar has increased cooperation on counter-terrorism efforts and touted a new anti-money laundering law that was ultimately passed the following year. Still, this cooperation followed years of criticism from the U.S. that the country served as a key fund-raising locale for groups like al-Qaeda and the Taliban, particularly through then poorly regulated charities. The U.S. says a longtime government minister provided support for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, mastermind of the September 11 attacks, who lived in Qatar for several years during the 1990s. And in the disarray of the Syrian revolution, some Qatari support went to rebels who later went on to join Islamic State. Still, the U.S. has levied similar criticisms at other Gulf states.\\n\\n8. Is the Muslim Brotherhood charge true?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nQatar's government denies it supports the Muslim Brotherhood, or any political party, but rather says it helps governments and people who may at times be governed by the Muslim Brotherhood, such as Egypt from 2012 to 2013. Qatar's accusers consider the Brotherhood to be a terrorist movement. Egyptian leader Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi banned the organization and has overseen a crackdown on its supporters after overthrowing an elected president from the group in 2013. Qatar has hosted prominent Brotherhood cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi since he fled Egypt in 1961, offering him a popular talk show on the state-backed Al Jazeera TV channel.\\n\\n9. How has Qatar weathered the boycott?\\n\\nQatar is one of the world's wealthiest nations, and its economy has proved resilient. Because the country has opened shipping corridors, sales of gas and oil have continued uninterrupted. Saudi Arabia shocked Qatar by closing its only land border, halting shipments of food. But the smaller country quickly opened alternative trade routes and found substitute suppliers, notably Turkey, Iran and India. Denied overflight rights for Qatar Airways by the boycotting group, it negotiated them with Iran. The country remains on good terms with the U.S., which bases thousands of troops and a regional air operations center there. Qatar, which quit the oil cartel OPEC at the start of 2019, has also been charting a different course from its neighbors on energy policy, with its fortunes tied more closely to natural gas. The country is scheduled to host the FIFA World Cup soccer tournament in 2022.\\n\\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com"}

So when academics have made controversial posts on social media about any number of news items — mass shootings, the death of former first lady Barbara Bush or North Korea's imprisonment of Otto Warmbier — their posts have resulted in a range of disciplinary outcomes.\\n\\nPhansey may be one of the first administrators to be disciplined for his Facebook posts.\\n\\nJust a few months after receiving his MBA from Babson in 2008, he began working as an adjunct professor in the university's graduate program. In between teaching courses about marketing and sustainable entrepreneurship, he also helped develop curriculum for an undergraduate class combining biology and business.\\n\\nIn February, he made the jump to campus full time, joining Babson's administration to lead the school's sustainability initiatives.\\n\\nAs Trump floated the possibility on Saturday of retaliatory strikes against Iran, drawing widespread condemnation, Phansey chimed in on Facebook. (Trump has since backed away from the possibility of war with Iran.)\\n\\nHis post drew attention almost immediately, first boosted online by a Massachusetts tabloid-blog hybrid that is alternately devoted to supporting the New England Patriots and investigating social justice warriors. The blog predicted that echoing Trump's threats would cost Phansey his job, but that a Facebook post encouraging Iran was likely to get the professor tenure.\\n\\nThe opposite turned out to be true. On Wednesday, just one day after the blog post, Babson said it had launched an investigation into the matter and suspended Phansey with pay.\\n\\nThrough a public relations firm, Phansey told local news outlets on Wednesday that, as a born and raised American, he regretted the post, which had merely been his attempt at making a humorous juxtaposition: Whereas Iran has centuries-old churches and mosques, he said, the United States is home to a gargantuan mall in Minnesota and multimillion-dollar homes for reality stars.\\n\\n[Iranians celebrate their favorite cultural sites after Trump threatened to target them]\\n\\nI am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone, he wrote in a statement to the Herald. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat. I condemn all acts of violence. I am particularly sorry to cause any harm or alarm for my colleagues at Babson, my beloved alma mater.\\n\\nLess than 24 hours later, he was fired.\\n\\nIn other cases where professors have mixed mentions of Trump or his politics with suggestions of violence, schools have made similar moves.\\n\\nIn 2017, the University of Tampa fired a visiting sociology professor who tweeted that Hurricane Harvey was instant Karma for the state of Texas going for Trump in the presidential election. In New Jersey that year, a similar fate awaited a gender studies adjunct at Montclair State University, who was stripped of two courses after he posting to Twitter that Trump was a f------ joke and should be shot.\\n\\nAnd at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a politics and global studies professor was placed on leave — and then resigned two years ago — after controversial tweets in which he said Trumpism was to blame for the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas.\\n\\nAs he reflected on his own firing, Phansey seemed to pick up on that trend.\\n\\nBeyond my own situation, I am really concerned about what this portends for our ability as Americans, he told the Herald, to engage in political discourse without presuming the worst about each other."}
{"original": "Those same problems now afflict the distribution of the vaccine, the miracle of scientific achievement that has the potential to bring the pandemic to an end. The lamentable difference is that this time, we've had months to think about the issues at stake and to prepare. Scientists and boards of ethicists have done the work. Yet politicians still seem clueless or cowardly, unwilling to lead the public through the excruciating questions that need to be asked and answered.\\n\\nAt the heart of the issue is a philosophical problem that has bedeviled the West (where individual liberties remain far more important than in Asia) throughout the long months of the pandemic. At the risk of oversimplification, it is the battle between the ideas represented by Immanuel Kant and John Stuart Mill.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFurther Reading\\n\\n• Herd Immunity Doesn't Solve Our Moral Dilemma\\n\\n• Vaccine Confronts Humanity With Next Moral Test\\n\\n• The Golden Rule Is Dying of Covid-19\\n\\n• How Coronavirus Is Shaking Up the Moral Universe\\n\\nTo complicate matters, this moral and ideological debate is usually disguised as scientific judgment. Mathematical modeling indicates that as long as an available vaccine is both safe and effective in older adults, they should be a high priority for vaccination, the U.K. government wrote in its guidance for Covid-19 vaccinations.\\n\\nBut as Oxford University medical ethicists Alberto Giubilini, Julian Savulescu and Dominic Wilkinson point out:\\n\\nWhether older adults 'should' be high priority depends on what we want to achieve through a vaccination policy. And that involves value choices. Distribution of Covid-19 vaccines will need to maximize the public health benefits of the limited availability, or reduce the burden on the NHS, or save as many lives as possible from Covid-19. These are not necessarily the same thing and a choice among them is an ethical choice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPoliticians, as a rule, have not treated it as an ethical problem, or presented it to the public as one. So maybe it should not be surprising that confidence in the approach we are taking — or indeed any kind of public unity — remains elusive.\\n\\nWhen it comes to what the vaccine is trying to achieve, there are two broad possibilities:\\n\\n1. Give the vaccine to those at the greatest risk of dying from the virus.\\n\\n2. Inoculate people so as to minimize the spread and maximize the impact.\\n\\nThese questions raise two severe problems, one ethical and one scientific. The ethical problem is that they lead to very different programs of vaccine distribution.\\n\\nOne program broadly falls in line with a school of thinking that goes back at least as far as the 18th century Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant, and holds that we should always treat people as ends in themselves and not as means to an end. In common parlance, this is similar to the biblical Golden Rule — do unto others what we would want done to ourselves. Under this approach, we should first vaccinate those who are most at risk from the virus. This means giving priority to the elderly and those in care homes, and then steadily spreading vaccinations to younger age groups. This is happening in the U.K. and Germany.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe other program is more utilitarian. This school of thinking, dating back to Victorian liberal thinkers led by John Stuart Mill, holds that we should aim to seek the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Sacrificing a few to save many, then, can be justified. This would lead to vaccinating those most likely to catch the virus and spread it, even if their mortality risk is low. Doctors and emergency workers would go first, followed arguably by prisoners, people who come into contact with lots of other people, and those in communities that are particularly susceptible to spread. This is pretty much the course being followed by most states in the U.S.\\n\\n(Utilitarians also think in terms of maximizing the amount of life saved. To use the ethical jargon, if we aim to maximize the number of quality-adjusted life years, then saving the elderly, who already live restricted lives, grows harder to justify.)\\n\\nThis division is much the same as the argument over lockdowns, where Kantians argued for doing everything to save every last soul (through complete lockdowns), while utilitarians argued that a more balanced approach would work better in the long run. That issue is still very much alive. Added to this classic dilemma, there is the scientific problem.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe new Covid-19 vaccines are remarkably effective in preventing illness. What is not yet clear — as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concedes — is whether being vaccinated will stop the people who take it from infecting others, and it's why vaccinated people are still being asked to wear masks.\\n\\nThis has implications for our philosophical strategies. If vaccinating medical workers and potential super-spreaders first might not help reduce the spread, then there is no choice but to give the vaccine to the oldest first. (Sorry, utilitarians.)\\n\\nIf it does, then a program aimed at those most likely to spread the disease becomes very easy to defend. To make the decision, we need scientists to tell us whether the vaccine can stop infectiousness, and to identify who should best be vaccinated to halt the pandemic most quickly — both profound and difficult questions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe problem confronting everyone in the West is that we aren't even talking about this stuff. Moral choices are unavoidable. We need to understand them, discuss them as a society and come to conclusions. Then we need to apply the science to those choices. Western institutions have so far proved wholly unable to stage such a public discussion.\\n\\nIn its absence, the hoarding and anti-social behavior witnessed last spring is now showing itself in hideously selfish antics over the vaccine. People are jumping queues and impersonating others, while interest groups are involved in an unsightly attempt to lobby Congress for their people to get the shot first. When Stanford Medical School attempted to organize distribution using an algorithm, they faced an insurrection from staff chanting, The algorithm sucks!\\n\\nThe first doses of vaccine mark only the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Ahead of us lie the nightmares of dealing with the issue that many high-risk factors overlap with social factors. Ethnic minorities and the poor are at greater risk both of catching the virus and of sustaining serious harm from it if they do. If governments around the world decide to give them priority (and both Kant and Mill might well agree that they should), will that decision be communicated clearly enough to gain acceptance among those who have to wait?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the end of a year that posed deep and troubling moral questions, the tragedy is not only that they remain unanswered, but that society at large, despite help from scientists and ethicists, have scarcely even attempted to address them. Many more lie ahead.\\n\\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\\n\\nJohn Authers is a senior editor for markets.

{"original": "belSpeaking as thousands of abortion opponents gathered on the Mall for the annual March for Life, Severino told reporters that the division's focus would be on actions, as in types of medical procedures, rather than groups of people. He drew parallels with Target refusing to sell guns. This is not about denying anyone health care, he said during a conference call.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe rule follows the department's announcement on Thursday that it was creating a new civil rights division to review complaints from doctors, nurses and others under 25 existing statutes, most of which allow workers to opt out of procedures like abortion, assisted suicide and sterilization.\\n\\nThe document released describes an approach to conscience and religious protections that is significantly broader than current regulations. The number of entities that would be covered by the new rule is massive — as many as 745,000 hospitals, dentists' offices, pharmacies, ambulance services and others — and the steps any entity must take to show it is in compliance is increased.\\n\\nIt also adds a definition of discrimination, which did not exist under a 2008 rule, and lays out how this could provide the federal government with grounds to challenge a state's enforcement of its own laws, such as a statute requiring abortion insurance coverage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder that rule of the George W. Bush administration, which was rescinded and replaced by the Obama administration in 2011, covered institutions or groups could continue to receive federal funding by signing a certification that they were aware of existing legal protections. The new regulation would incorporate elements of the older rule but also would go further and require entities to post notices of the protections. Officials say they expect them to ensure that organization-wide safeguards are in place, update policies as needed and implement staff training.\\n\\nThe draft language notes that the Office of Civil Rights could initiate a compliance review of organizations that get federal funding and look at whether the notice is in personnel manuals and employment applications, among other details.\\n\\nHHS estimates that implementing the new rule would cost $312.3 million in the first year and $125.5 million annually in the second through fifth years. The department said it expects to add the equivalent of 4.5 full-time staff to provide oversight.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a separate action Friday, officials rescinded a guidance letter about Medicaid that was issued by the Obama administration in 2016, which they say limited states' authority to regulate providers within their borders. That letter said states attempting to disqualify abortion providers from their Medicaid programs could come under federal scrutiny.\\n\\nBy contrast, officials explained, a new guidance letter aims to empower states to make the most appropriate decisions for themselves. In recent years, Indiana and other states have blocked Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood because of the abortion services it offers. The new policy could allow states to receive millions in federal funding while banning abortion providers from participating in a family planning program for low-income women.\\n\\nThe state likely to take immediate advantage of the policy reversal is Texas, which last year submitted a waiver petition to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asking to regain funding it stopped accepting for its Healthy Texas Women program when it chose to exclude providers that perform or promote elective abortions or contract or affiliate with such providers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe administration has yet to issue a decision in that case.\\n\\nDawn Laguens, executive vice president for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the reversal is meant to encourage states to block access to care at Planned Parenthood and control where women can go for health care.\\n\\nThe law is clear: It is illegal to bar women from seeking care at Planned Parenthood. Long-standing protections within Medicaid safeguard every person's right to access care at their qualified provider of choice, Laguens said in a statement.\\n\\nSome health and legal experts question whether the proposed rule on conscience rights could be broadly interpreted and whether, as an example, a doctor could refuse sex-reassignment surgery to someone who is transgender. Existing laws do not specifically address if a doctor can deny services related to an individual's sexual identity; the statutes focus on actions providers say they can't do in good conscience, Severino said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeverino did not rule out that LGBT-related cases could come up once the rule becomes final. It's difficult to deal with every hypothetical in a law-enforcement context because we can't prejudge every case that comes through, he said.\\n\\nUnder the Obama administration, Severino said, HHS did not provide much guidance, enforcement or outreach on medical issues involving moral or religious liberty claims. The department received 10 complaints under Obama, and it has received 34 since Trump took office a year ago.\\n\\nThe regulations make clear and give notice to the public that we're in business on these statutes, and we'll give it the proper focus and energy they deserve because they've been ignored for too long, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeverino said the regulations are an outgrowth of Trump's 2017 executive order that included a section on conscience protections. That order was seen as a direct response to some of the Obama administration actions that upset religious conservatives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeveral religious groups battled the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act's mandate that employers and insurers provide no-cost contraceptive coverage for employees. In October, HHS introduced rules expanding the range of businesses that can object to the requirement on religious or moral grounds and receive an exemption.\\n\\nThe protection of conscience is a freedom that for too long has not been given the attention it deserves, Severino said Friday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMany religious conservative groups are praising HHS's moves this week.\\n\\nAmericans should not be forced to choose between their faith and their desire to help patients, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said in a statement. As President Trump continues to follow through on his promises on these core issues, he will continue to have the support of social conservatives on his policy initiatives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose on the political and religious left, however, see the actions as an attack on all patients' right to receive health care. HHS is setting up a system to allow discrimination, said the Rev. Mike Scheunemeyer, who leads Health and Wholeness Advocacy Ministries, United Church of Christ.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen I look at how Jesus responded to the people who came to him to be healed, I can find no example of him turning anyone away, Scheunemeyer said in a statement. This is the example we should emulate in America.\\n\\nCamilla Taylor, acting legal director of Lambda Legal, said in an interview that the proposed conscience regulations would not only allow health-care providers to turn away patients in violation of medical and ethical rules which require they provide care without discriminating but also to excuse them from having to give referrals for other providers.\\n\\nThe proposed regulations are an outrageous attack on the most vulnerable Americans, Taylor said. They allow health-care providers to deny care while receiving federal funding to certain patients based on who they are."}

The report focuses on government surveillance, but the electronics companies themselves have been accused of using their televisions to invade customers' privacy. Last month the Federal Trade Commission settled with television maker Vizio, which was accused of collecting and sharing its customers' data without permission. Samsung in 2015 drew criticism when its privacy policy included a warning telling people not to have private conversations too near their smart televisions in their own living rooms.\\n\\nFor consumers, it's going to get more difficult to find a television that isn't smart. According to a report from the Consumer Technology Association, 28.7 million smart TVs are expected to sold in the United States in 2017, out of 40 million units of total digital displays expected to sell. That means roughly 72 percent of TVs sold in 2017 will be smart in some way, though the report doesn't break down how many of those might have audio and video recording capabilities.\\n\\nOf course, the news that its televisions could be used as surveillance tools, isn't great for Samsung.

GLAD is an acronym for GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders.\\n\\nPresident Trump announced a sweeping ban on transgender people's military service via Twitter in July 2017, citing what he viewed as the tremendous medical costs and disruption. The administration's order reversed President Barack Obama's policy of allowing transgender men and women to serve openly and receive funding for sex-reassignment surgery.\\n\\nAttorneys for active-duty service members went to court to block the policy shift, which could subject current transgender service members to discharge and deny them certain medical care.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe court rulings were met with another policy revision this year from then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who issued a plan to bar men and women from the military who identify with a gender different from their birth gender and who are seeking to transition. Mattis's plan makes exceptions, for instance, for about 900 transgender individuals who are already serving openly and for others who would serve in accordance with their birth gender.\\n\\nThe order Friday said the lower-court erred by not giving sufficient weight to the administration's effort to revise its policy in response to the initial court ruling.

{"original": "But here near the developing complex on the banks of the Ohio River, local Democratic official Earl Butch Shamp looks downstream at Peduto and sees the kind of politician he says is killing the Democratic Party in large swaths of southwestern Pennsylvania.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen people here hear the mayor, they hear someone who's just totally out of touch about where the jobs are, said Shamp, the lone Democrat on the Potter Township Board of Supervisors in Beaver County, where the plant is located. The mayor should just stay out of it and stay in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRoyal Dutch Shell's giant petrochemical facility, which will crack natural gas molecules to produce a component for plastics, is also exposing a crack in Pennsylvania's Democratic Party. For some, like Peduto, the project is an environmental menace that undercuts the party's climate change agenda.\\n\\nFor others, like Shamp, it is a catalyst for a region's economic revival and an opportunity to win over a white working class that believes Democrats have prioritized social issues over their financial prosperity.\\n\\nWith Pennsylvania expected to be a crucial battleground in the 2020 presidential contest, the local fissure is highlighting a national dilemma for the Democratic Party as it tries to address the environmental demands of liberal urban activists while reaching out to voters who rely on the manufacturing industry for jobs.\\n\\nThe party's failure to find that balance proved fateful in 2016, when blue-collar voters in the counties that surround Pittsburgh abandoned Democrats in droves, and Donald Trump carried the state by about 44,000 votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Pennsylvania, everything matters right now politically, said Christopher P. Borick, the director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. This is certainly not where Democrats want to be, in terms of finding a unified voice in a key swing state ahead of 2020.\\n\\nThe petrochemical plant has become a political crucible. President Trump visited the Shell site in August, speaking for more than an hour while surrounded by construction workers and touting the complex as one of the single biggest construction projects in the nation . . . made possible by clean, affordable, all-American natural gas.\\n\\nFor Trump's political rivals, Peduto has upped the ante by tying his potential endorsement to where the candidates stand on environmental matters. He has reached out to the campaigns of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, hoping that they back his vision for more government funding for green industries.\\n\\nPeduto said he is leaning toward Bloomberg and Buttigieg because the energy policy positions of Sens.

Conversely, Biden's positions, he said, are more like Donald Trump's than they are a pragmatic approach toward the middle.\\n\\nShell's 400-acre facility relies on Pennsylvania's vast reserves of natural gas, obtained by fracking shaleto produce ethylene, a component of plastic that is used for various consumer products, from food containers to furniture.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIts construction has generated 6,000 jobs already, and it is slated to employ 600 permanent workers when it opens in the early 2020s, according to the company. Industry leaders and state officials say the area around the plant could turn into a hub for the petrochemical industry, producing more jobs, with tentative discussions about a half-dozen additional petrochemical facilities in nearby communities in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.\\n\\nWorried about western Pennsylvania becoming the next chemical alley, Peduto shocked many observers in October when he called for a moratorium on cracker plants, against the wishes of corporate and labor leaders.\\n\\nThe Shell plant is licensed to produce up to 1.6 million tons of polyethylene annually, a process that could involve emitting up to 522 tons of volatile organic compounds and 348 tons of nitrogen oxides annually. Peduto said those emissions are equal to adding 450,000 vehicles to ­Pittsburgh-area highways, severely undercutting the city's goal of being carbon neutral by 2030.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPeduto, who is in his second term, also worries that the plant will make it harder for him to attract and retain the medical and technology jobs that power Pittsburgh's economy.\\n\\nWe have to be able to recognize that there is a new industry that has been built out in southwestern Pennsylvania, and it is contingent upon clean air and clean water, Peduto said, citing Uber's and Microsoft's recent investments in the region. And that industry is much more important than the legacy and industry of fossil fuel.\\n\\nThe blowback from other Democrats has been intense. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf publicly broke with Peduto on the issue, saying that the region cannot flourish economically without capitalizing on its natural resources, which he thinks can be done in an environmentally responsible way.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe have to do it right, but we have to do it, or we are not going to have the future that we deserve, Wolf said in an interview. I think you need the jobs of technology, which Pittsburgh has, but I think you need to take advantage of your natural attributes, one of which is natural gas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShell said it has taken steps to minimize the complex's environmental impact.\\n\\nWe designed our Pennsylvania facility to obtain the lowest achievable emissions. That includes deployment of the best emissions control technologies available and one of the nation's most stringent leak detection and repair programs, the company said in an emailed statement.\\n\\nPeduto's position is in line with his constituents' evolving politics. Since Trump's election, Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh and its immediate suburbs, has moved to the left politically, with Democrats flipping two state Senate seats and one seat on the county council.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTwo democratic socialists, Sara Innamorato and Summer Lee, also unseated incumbent Democrats in state legislative races in Allegheny County after they campaigned on environmental issues, including opposition to fracking.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCitizens are finally saying, 'We've had enough climate change, and we've had enough air pollution, and the last thing we want is the region to be inundated with even more bad air,'  said Matt Dixon, a Pittsburgh environmental activist.\\n\\nDespite those recent Democratic gains in Allegheny County, the rest of southwestern Pennsylvania has continued to move to the right. Last year, Republicans seized control of four county boards in historically Democratic areas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPennsylvania Republicans predict Peduto's environmental views will drive even more voters away from Democrats this year.\\n\\nThis is a guy who put together a $9 billion tax credit plan to try to lure Amazon, but yet he wants to toss these jobs away? said Allegheny County Councilman Sam DeMarco III (R), referring to Pittsburgh's unsuccessful effort to lure Amazon's planned East Coast headquarters.

I'm glad for us to have a chance to talk about it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe controversy surrounding Warren's past claim of Native American ancestry, which first emerged during her 2012 campaign for Senate, has followed her despite two statewide election wins, a series of sometimes skeptical interviews, and a highly produced October 2018 video in which she released the results of a DNA test.\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Jan. 4 held her first campaign event in Iowa since launching her exploratory committee for the 2020 presidential race. (Reuters)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren's campaign team produced the video after supporters and critics, one of whom had tried to conduct a test by sending some of Warren's saliva to a DNA company, had asked how she could ever put the issue to bed.\\n\\nI recognize that it is unfair that you have to deal with this 'Pocahontas' allegation, said Jon Lovett, a co-host of the popular liberal podcast Pod Save America, in a March interview with Warren. Why not [get] some sort of a test, get some sort of a way to dispense with it once and for all, even if it's conceding in this one instance to Trump's bullying?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president, who appropriated the Pocahontas nickname for Warren from conservative Boston media, continued mocking her after the test. But the senator's visit to Iowa so far demonstrated both how she had navigated around her political problem and how a media ecosystem often shaped by the president could readily return to it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn the stump, Warren boiled down her answer on the controversy itself to 55 seconds.\\n\\nI am not a person of color; I am not a citizen of a tribe, she said. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship, and I respect that difference. I grew up in Oklahoma, and like a lot of folks in Oklahoma, we heard stories about our ancestry. When I first ran for public office, Republicans homed in on this part of my history, and thought they could make a lot of hay out of it. A lot of racial slurs, and a lot of ugly stuff. And so my decision was: I'm just gonna put it all out there. Took a while, but just put it all out there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren, who has not otherwise mentioned the president by name on this trip, added that she could not stop Donald Trump from what he's gonna do, including hurling racial insults.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYes, you can! shouted Glenda Verhoeven, a 63-year old farmer in the audience. Afterward, Verhoeven explained that she thought Trump had revealed just how nervous Warren made him: She already knows the enemy, and he knows her.\\n\\nThe ancestry question was absent from Warren's Friday-night town hall at a packed venue in Council Bluffs, and from a policy-heavy roundtable in Storm Lake on Saturday.\\n\\nWhile Massachusetts Republicans had mocked Warren outside her events — one candidate followed her last year in a bus, decorated by a photo illustration of Warren in native headdress — there were no antics or operatives outside this weekend's first Iowa events.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the DNA answer was quickly sent to reporters by America Rising, a Republican opposition research group that has spent years tracking and researching Warren.

{"original": "1. It's fine not to know exactly what the policy objectives are yet\\n\\nBoth before and after Saturday's marches across the country and around the world, observers asked what the goal might be. March organizers released an official platform, but it offered more broad principles than immediate policy goals. The concern: Without a concise policy agenda, the march will lead to nowhere.\\n\\nIn reality, that's not necessarily a problem. The first public meeting explicitly called in the name of women's rights — the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848 — is considered the start of the suffrage movement. True, it included the right to vote on its — very long — official list of policy grievances, the Declaration of Sentiments. But suffrage was the item attendees objected to most, for fear the demand was so radical it would divide a movement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo what's the lesson? When a movement begins, the final goal may not yet be clear. It can be hard to see the political possibility in what has for so long has been impossible. Even if Saturday's marches don't immediately deliver a clear policy objective, they might be the start of a movement that will. We may well be surprised, as some early women's rights organizers were, by which grievances become the central rallying cry.\\n\\n2. The Women's March on Washington was impressive. But the sister marches may be more politically important\\n\\nThe D.C. Women's March was apparently among the capitol's largest ever. Ongoing data collection efforts by scholars Erica Chenoweth and Jeremy Pressman put the crowd size somewhere between a low estimate of 470,000 and a high of 680,000.\\n\\nBut the estimated 3 million or more who attended one of the hundreds of sister marches across the country and the globe may matter more for organizing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConsider women's suffrage politics in Colorado, as I detailed in my book, The Woman Suffrage Movement in America: A Reassessment. In 1875, national suffrage leadership sent two organizers to the state, thinking it was ready for the vote. The national organizers couldn't interest anyone. One shocked organizer reported that we were told in Central — one of the places where we could not get a hearing — that we must advertise a dogfight, then we could get a crowd.\\n\\nEverything changed once Colorado women organized themselves. Local suffragists knew better. They linked women's suffrage to 1893's surging populism — and won Colorado women the right to vote that year. The lesson: A locally developed strategy can be far more effective than one imposed from above.\\n\\nFurther, Holly McCammon's research on the suffrage movement finds that local organizing generally diversified the movement, decentralized decision-making, and spurred conflict among movement leaders — which led to more effective and innovative tactics.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo will the local marches lead to local movement organizing? That seems likely, given that sister marches were not products of a national committee, but of existing local leaders and organizations that stepped in to produce and affiliate their local action. Existing local organizational infrastructure and political knowledge has thus already passed a first test.\\n\\nThe next important test is whether local groups can keep the newly-active involved. This may even require a willingness to establish entirely new organizations that unify old and new interests. Like locally built suffrage organizations, these groups will be most effective if they take advantage of local political opportunities while also staying connected to a national politics of equal rights. That feedback loop of innovation from local to national helps organizations build strength.\\n\\n3. Policies change when elite incentives change — even without changing anyone's hearts or minds\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis may be a social movement scholar's most repeated message. Movements do not win by changing hearts and minds; they win by changing the incentives facing political elites.\\n\\nTo be sure, a social movement can deploy public opinion as a strategic asset. But not only does public opinion in favor of a cause or policy not ensure its political success, public sentiment about protest is quite often negative.\\n\\nBut elite incentives can be moved in many other ways.\\n\\nAs I detailed in an earlier Monkey Cage post, new organizational partnerships and newly contentious partisan political environments produced radical changes in the viability of new voting rights for women. After years of defeat or neglect, suffrage movement success came when partisan political elites found themselves facing broader coalitions for the cause — particularly in moments of electoral uncertainty.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Women's March is in some ways already there. It erupted after a peculiarly competitive election. Moving at a moment when the political chess board is in disarray gave the march prominence and power. Whether any emerging demands are met depends less on whether the march changed public opinion than on whether its successor movement can give elites more reasons to move to its side.\\n\\n4. Coalitions are hard but necessary movement work. And women may have an advantage here\\n\\nSusan B. Anthony, arguably the most famous suffrage leader, opposed coalitions. She warned repeatedly that the suffrage movement should isolate itself from other causes, once imploring an organizer to know nothing — push nothing — but suffrage. That backfired, making it easier for political elites to dismiss suffrage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLater national leaders changed strategies, learning from local activists — like those Colorado women — that partnering with groups like unions and farmers' organizations resulted in dramatic leaps forward.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd yet making coalitions work is hard. The long list of challenges includes lopsided cooperation, fights over priorities and strategy, and even noticing common ground.\\n\\nCentral to making suffrage coalitions work was the cross-identity bond of womanhood. It was women within organized labor who pushed unions to contribute to the suffrage cause. Women in the Grange and Farmers' Alliances pulled in the farmers' lobby. Women of color in civil rights organizations articulated the link between themselves and white women's suffrage organizing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, the suffrage movement too often gave its coalition partners short shrift. After drawing on the strength of women's diversity to leverage coalitions for suffrage, leadership repeatedly fell back to emphasizing white, middle-class, urban women's voices.\\n\\nWomen have a particularly powerful political tool in their common identity, but one that will take more careful leadership decisions than those of suffragists to reach its full potential. A diverse group of women organizers at the helm of the Women's March was important for just this reason: It builds the coalitional potential of a new movement. Whether coalition approaches continue — both nationally and locally — will matter tremendously for any future movement's effectiveness."}

The U.S. economy has continued to notch solid growth and maintain a low unemployment rate, and the stock market has reached record highs in recent days. Trump signed a partial trade deal with China last week, easing global tensions over his use of tariffs.\\n\\nBut the president faces continued questions about his approach to foreign affairs. His decision to order a strike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani this month — and his threat to impose a 25 percent tariff on European cars over a foreign policy dispute — created more tumult in the Middle East and in the transatlantic relationship between the United States and its closest allies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump was billed as the keynote speaker for the annual business-themed confab in this Alpine ski town, but the main attraction was Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 17, who has sparred with Trump on Twitter.\\n\\nOur house is still on fire.

He did not attend her main speech later in the day, although she was in the audience for his.\\n\\nTrump is an outlier at the forum for his views on climate change. The president has publicly criticized global efforts to combat rising temperatures and has made ridiculing energy-efficient products a key part of his reelection stump speeches.\\n\\nAhead of Trump's address, Schwab told the gathering that the world is in a state of emergency and that the window to address climate change is closing. He also reminded the audience that every voice heard at the forum deserved respect.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough climate change and environmental stewardship lead the agenda here, a survey of chief executives released Monday shows that they do not count climate change as among the top 10 threats to business growth.\\n\\nTrump was accompanied here by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow, and a delegation including national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Also present was adviser and speechwriter Stephen Miller, whose hard-line stance on limiting immigration and denunciations of globalism infused Trump's address to the United Nations in September.\\n\\nThis is the wreckage I was elected to clean up, Trump said Tuesday of the bleak economic landscape he inherited.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe praised himself repeatedly, saying that his actions saved the global economy from the brink of recession, rescued the U.S. manufacturing industry and reshaped the rules of international trade to reflect a fairer system.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe occasionally strayed from the facts as he tried to paint a picture of an economy in shambles before his election.\\n\\nHe described the 4.7 percent unemployment rate before he took office as reasonably high, even though it was well below the average rate in the United States over the past 70 years. He also took credit for additional funding that has been approved for historically black colleges and universities, saying inaccurately that the funding saved the schools from ruin.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe took a swipe at the Federal Reserve for its interest rate policies, saying his economic achievements came despite the rate-setting body. Although his attacks on the Fed have become common, the once-taboo practice seemed to startle some in the audience here.\\n\\nSome in the audience laughed and rolled their eyes at Trump's claims he has created an inclusive economy that should be a global model. But many business leaders here believe Trump is likely to be reelected and are opting to praise him on topics they agree on.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think he glossed over some of the more controversial issues on the environment, said Steven Collis, chief executive of AmerisourceBergen, but he called it a surprisingly well-met speech overall.\\n\\nMarc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, has donated to several Democratic candidates for president, but he applauded Trump's announcement that the United States will join the Trillion Tree Campaign to plant more trees to help reduce carbon emissions.\\n\\nI'm very excited that the United States has joined the Trillion Tree initiative, Benioff said as he left the speech.\\n\\nTrump is using his day-and-a-half-long visit to lobby corporate chieftains for greater U.S. investment and meet with leaders including Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Iraqi President Barham Salih and Kurdish leader Nechirvan Barzani.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump largely steered clear of discussing domestic political issues during his speech to the forum in 2018, instead using his remarks to tout his accomplishments and encourage business leaders to invest in the United States.

In a television interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., Sajjan said that the Iraqi parliament's decision to pass a nonbinding resolution calling on all foreign troops to leave the country created a complex situation. We know the current situation is now far more complicated, and we have to accept their process, he said, but it is more complicated than just one vote. Canada has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq as part of both the NATO mission and the global coalition fighting the Islamic State. It has suspended both of those missions, but Sajjan said he hopes they will continue. He told the CBC that Canada has taken the appropriate steps for force protection in Iraq and that some nonessential personnel have been moved out of the country in the wake of Soleimani's killing. Asked if U.S. officials had given Canada notice of their plan to kill the Iranian general, Sajjan said that Canada had an indication something was going to happen but did not know what was going to happen. In a television interview on Monday with CTV News, Sajjan condemned Iran's actions in the region but would not comment on whether he thought Soleimani's killing was legal. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted on Monday that he met with Sajjan and Jonathan Vance, the chief of the defense staff, in the morning. He said the safety of Canadians in the region is his top priority.

Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, denied reports that the intelligence that led to the U.S. killing of Soleimani was razor-thin. Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, Milley said very, very few people saw the intelligence, which he said demonstrated that Soleimani was planning imminent operations against U.S. forces in the region. I would be happy when the appropriate time comes, in front of proper committees and anybody else, in history, I will stand by the intelligence I saw. That was compelling. It was imminent. It was very, very clear in scale/scope, Milley said. Did it exactly say who, what, when, where? No. But he was planning, coordinating and synchronizing significant combat operations against U.S. military forces in the region — and it was imminent, Milley added. Milley said he wouldn't give any more details about the intelligence because such a disclosure would jeopardize the sources and methods of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. I know people say, well, you're hiding behind it, and you lie. That's not true. I know what I saw, Milley said. Those of us who were involved in the decision-making of that, we would have been culpably negligent to the American people had we not made the decision we made, Milley added.

According to the report, Zarif requested a visa weeks ago to attend a U.N. Security Council meeting.

But Trump has actually spent closer to $420 billion on military equipment since he was elected, according to Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The rest of the money was spent on personnel, operations and maintenance, and research and development. AD AD\\n\\nLink copied link In response to Trump threat, Iran's president invokes 1988 tragedy many Americans have forgotten WASHINGTON — On Saturday, Trump invoked history when tweeting out a threat to destroy 52 Iranian sites … some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture. He said the potential targets represent the 52 Americans who were held hostage there for 444 days from 1979 to 1981. On Monday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani also invoked history in response to Trump's threat. Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #IR655 Never threaten the Iranian nation, he wrote. His hashtag #IR655 refers to Iran Air Flight 655, a commercial jet shot down by the U.S. military by mistake July 3, 1988, killing all 290 civilians and crew on board, including 66 children. Though the incident is nearly forgotten now in the United States, it is etched deeply in memory in Iran, where the country is mourning the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. AD AD\\n\\nLink copied link U.S. general calls letter to Iraqis an honest mistake WASHINGTON — After the U.S. military's letter describing plans to reposition troops within Iraq in preparation for a possible withdrawal leaked, Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees the Middle East. McKenzie told him the draft letter was an honest mistake, but used other words that were a little more colorful than mistake, Milley said. The U.S. military drafted the letter because it is moving forces around the region, within Iraq and from Kuwait into Iraq, and anticipates increased helicopter movement, Milley said, noting that draft letters are often coordinated with partners in advance, but are circulated without the signature of the official sending the communication. The leaked letter wasn't signed. Milley said that McKenzie, the top U.S. commander overseeing the Middle East, said the letter should never have happened. We understand U.S. government policy — nobody is leaving, there's no onward movement, we got all that. Honest mistake. Draft, Milley said McKenzie told him. AD AD\\n\\nLink copied link Esper says U.S. has not made any decision to leave Iraq; Milley calls letter to Iraqi officials 'poorly worded' and 'a mistake' WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said during a briefing at the Pentagon that the United States has not made any decision to leave Iraq. We are repositioning forces throughout the region … beyond that, with regard to that letter, which I have read once, I can't tell you the veracity of that letter, I can tell you what I read, that letter is inconsistent with where we are right now, Esper said. Milley said the letter was a draft that the U.S. military sent to Iraqi military officials for coordination purposes but hasn't been signed or finalized. That letter — it was a draft, it was a mistake, it was unsigned, it should not have been released, Milley said. And the first part of it, which says 'repositioning forces over the course of the coming days to prepare for onward movement' … [was] poorly worded, implies withdrawal. That is not what's happening. Asked whether the U.S. military was prepared to strike Iranian cultural sites, as President Trump has suggested, Esper said the military would follow the laws of armed conflict. Asked whether that means no, because international law prohibits targeting such sites during war, Esper said: That's the laws of armed conflict. Esper said the United States remains prepared for any contingency with regard to Iran, and the message to Tehran is that the ball remains in their court.\\n\\nAD AD\\n\\nLink copied link U.S. military says it will reposition troops in Iraq in preparation for possible withdrawal WASHINGTON — In a draft letter released Monday, Marine Corps Brig. Gen. William H. Seely III said that U.S. forces will be relocated to prepare for onward movement and that we respect your sovereign decision to order our departure. A U.S. military official confirmed the letter's authenticity. The letter was released one day after Iraqi lawmakers passed a nonbinding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave the country. But because Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned in November and is now acting only as a caretaker, he was not authorized to sign it into law. But a defense official speaking on the condition of anonymity said the letter was Gen Seely's attempt to notify the Iraqis that we are going to be moving people around Iraq … This is not an indication that we're leaving. The official said that because the United States had suspended at least some training activities, it was moving training-related forces out of Iraq and bringing force protection forces into the country. We're not making plans to leave, the official said.

A company spokesperson described it as a precautionary measure. The California-based oil giant shut down drilling in the region in 2015 because of the threat posed by Islamic State fighters at the time. Drilling resumed in 2017. For now, in contrast, work is continuing in the Kurdish fields with all-local workers. The company characterized the decision to withdraw foreign workers as not a huge evacuation, but it would not provide details on the numbers of people involved.\\n\\nLink copied link Pentagon tells force of 4,500 sailors and Marines to be ready to support Middle East operations if necessary WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has told the Bataan Amphibious Ready Group, a force of about 4,500 sailors and Marines aboard Navy ships, to be ready to support operations in the Middle East if required, a defense official said Monday, speaking on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue. The official declined to specify the location of the group, led by the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan. A second official said Friday that the ships were approaching the Mediterranean Sea and could be called upon if needed. The decision could bolster the number of U.S. troops in the region by about 10,000, as the Trump administration and Iranian officials threaten each other following numerous attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and the U.S. killing of Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad last week. Those troop increases come on top of the Pentagon's deployment of an additional 14,000 troops to the Middle East in 2019, citing the need to counter Iranian aggression.\\n\\nLink copied link E.U. foreign ministers to hold emergency meeting Friday to respond to Iran crisis BRUSSELS — European Union foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Friday in Brussels to discuss how to respond to the escalating crisis with Iran, diplomats said Monday, including whether Europe starts the process that could lead to the eventual reimposition of sanctions on Iran. The unusual gathering will give Europeans a chance to coordinate plans among all 28 member states. Leaders have been reluctant to publicly condemn the United States for Soleimani's killing, focusing most of their ire on Iran, which they view as the core threat to their security interests. But they have invested more than a year of efforts to try to preserve the 2015 Iran nuclear deal following Trump's pullout. Many European diplomats view Soleimani's death as the final blow to hopes that the accord could hold together until the possible election in November of a U.S. president more supportive of the nuclear agreement than Trump. Iran on Sunday announced that it would take major additional steps to depart from the terms of the nuclear accord, although it stopped short of saying it would significantly increase its uranium enrichment. Europeans took that as a sign that Tehran is still interested in extracting concessions in exchange for returning to at least partial adherence to the deal, rather than walking away from it altogether. Triggering the process that could lead to the reimposition of sanctions would entail additional months of negotiations. If sanctions were reimposed, that would likely mark the end of any effort by Iran to uphold the deal."}
{"original": "Thanos, the villain (and protagonist, really) of the $2 billion-grossing megahit, Avengers: Infinity War, was basically an omni-powered Paul Ehrlich. Whereas the comic book version of Thanos sought to kill half of the universe in order to prove his love for an anthropomorphized Death, the film version was driven insane by his home planet's self-immolation after a series of resource wars. Determined to eliminate suffering over food and land, over clean water and clean air, Thanos used the Infinity Gauntlet not to create abundance of each but to kill half of all living things.\\n\\nAgain, this is Ehrlichian in its madness: The author of The Population Bomb argued for years that the planet is overpopulated and that famines will wipe out a significant portion of humanity. It could still happen, I suppose — global warming could inspire an Interstellar-style blight; the skies could go dry — but, frustratingly for the doomsayers, life on Earth keeps getting better despite the overpopulation our precious blue orb continues to shoulder.\\n\\nAquaman is the surprise hit of the winter, racking up more than $800 million worldwide so far. And while Jason Momoa's bro-tastic turn as Arthur Curry is earning deserved plaudits from male and female audiences alike, it's Patrick Wilson's King Orm who caught my eye. Orm hopes to unite the underwater clans of Atlantis in order to create an unstoppable army that will destroy life on the planet's landmasses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Orm is no madman. His genocidal war is not the result of personal trauma or ideological insanity. It is, rather, a version of self-defense: The surface dwellers dump their trash into the water, strangling the sea life; the surface dwellers spew their smoke into the skies, choking the ocean with particulates; the surface dwellers hunt to extinction the ocean's animals, depriving the Atlanteans of conveyances. Humanity must die so Atlantis might live.\\n\\nYou saw something similar in Kingsman: The Secret Service a few years back. Amongst the most reactionary films of our age, Kingsman featured as its villain a tech guru named Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson). This billionaire was so disgusted by humanity's excesses and so riled by the excretions of the masses that he engineered a plot to kill all of us in the most horribly violent manner possible. He invented a device that would cause man to turn against man, mother against child, sister against brother — with bare hands, we would tear each other apart. In so doing, the planet would be cleansed of humanity's foul stench. Once free of the riffraff, wealthy swells and fabulous celebrities would reclaim the planet for themselves and rebuild the world in their image. Clean. Pristine. Free of the gauche hordes who have rendered our air travel unbearable and our beaches crowded messes.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists make a useful villain because their malevolence can be obscured by a patina of reasonableness. Global warming and other manmade problems are going to end the world if we don't do something — so just about anything is justified! But their villainy resonates with the masses because they actually do want to make life worse for people, for the most part.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "That does not mean, however, that there are no ideas, no intellectual energy and no depth coming from those on the right. Rather, it means these are from outcasts, struggling to sprout in a field of anti-intellectualism and rank dishonesty. Who are these people? What are they saying?\\n\\nFar and away the most interesting ideas factory on the right these days is the Niskanen Center, a sort of haven for lapsed libertarians who've discovered that simply shrinking government or disabling it is not a moral good. It's put out two of the most important pieces on the future of the right, The Center Can Hold: Public Policy for an Age of Extremes (discussed here) and Republicanism for Republicans. The latter, written by the center's vice president for policy Brink Lindsey, postulates:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the republican worldview, all Americans are real Americans, because we all pledge allegiance to one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. As Lincoln said in his first inaugural address, We are not enemies, but friends, because we are all members of one, all-embracing body politic. We're all in this together. This civic conception of patriotism stands in stark contrast to the blood-and-soil conception increasingly evident on the conservative right. . . . Such attitudes and rhetoric are utterly poisonous.\\n\\nLindsey suggests a new political foundation based on devotion to democratic institutions, to the public interest, or the common weal — the values that we share across ethnic, regional, sectarian, and class lines and that require collective action for their advancement, to constructive governance (shrinking government just to make it smaller is not the goal, [but] hostility toward corruption and wastefulness does push toward making government simpler and more transparent) and to resisting concentrations of power and wealth (The basic intuition here is that freedom requires a level of personal independence among the citizenry, and that in turn requires a broad middle class and limited extremes of wealth and poverty. In the republican view, excessive imbalances of power and status undermine government in the public interest because both the rules themselves and their administration will end up slanted in favor of the powerful.).\\n\\nThis becomes something new from Trumpian illiberalism and libertarian indifference to the public good:\\n\\nOpposition to domination leads simultaneously toward a deep appreciation of markets and the recognition of a vital supporting role for government. Competitive markets are a bulwark of independence because they encourage a proliferation of options; they are an important check against arbitrary power because they subject market actors to accountability at the hands of their customers. But for market competition to operate as intended, government has a few big jobs to do. First, it must provide and enforce rules that structure and sustain competition; second, it must secure the broad enabling conditions that allow people to participate successfully in the market system and protect them from the hazards of life when their participation goes awry.\\n\\nThen there are conservatives and defenders of the rule of law striving to remind us of four core conservative principles: free trade, robust legal immigration, defense of the rule of law and opposition to aggressive authoritarian regimes, including Russia. An umbrella organization dubbed Defending Democracy Together takes on tariffs, anti-immigrant exclusionism and assaults on the Constitution and democratic norms. The group also urges Republicans to return to American leadership in the world and defense of free peoples:\\n\\nThese four principles used to be assumed as central to modern conservatism. Now they are under assault from self-labeled guardians of the right. While many aspects of GOP policy of the past few decades (especially outright hostility to government) aren't worth saving, these four clearly are, for they nurture a free and diverse citizenry, promote innovation and social mobility, and adhere to the vision set out in our founding documents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRepublicans, ex-Republicans and independents should not give up these principles simply because the GOP has abandoned them and become enamored of statism, authoritarianism, xenophobia and Russian toadyism — impulses inimical to anyone who had a passing familiarity with the sort of conservatism practiced by Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Govs. Larry Hogan of Maryland, John Kasich of Ohio and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts. That half of the people on that list passed away and one is leaving office tells you how lacking we are in decent center-right leadership."}

You'd be crushed if that new couch were lost in a fire or other accident, so why not take a picture and catalogue that sweet sectional? The homeowners insurance you signed up for before purchasing the house should have adequate replacement coverage.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCreating a spreadsheet of your valuables will make it easier to recover those things in the event of an accident. Update the file as you unpack and buy big-ticket items for your new home, and keep a copy of the document at work or in the cloud just in case your computer is among those valuables lost.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMap out a maintenance plan. Your home needs upkeep. The last thing you want to do is put off routine maintenance that could prevent problems down the line, said Karen Hoskins, acting vice president of homeownership programs and lending at NeighborWorks America.\\n\\nThe home you just purchased is an investment that has to be protected, so don't defer maintenance, she said. Just making a schedule to remind you to change filters every three months or so would be good.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf spreadsheets aren't your thing, apps can do the work of reminding you to change those filters and clean those gutters. The BrightNest app helps you build a list of chores tailored to the features of your home. It also sends tips for things like mowing your lawn and making your own cleaning products.\\n\\nAn inspection report is another helpful guide. If you hired a professional to examine your home, then you should have what amounts to a checklist of projects. Some experts will tell you that you don't have to tackle everything on the list, but it is a good place to start.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf you need contractors, just make sure you do your homework, get several bids, references and check their license, Hoskins said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSet aside an emergency fund. Saving money after you've just handed over your life savings sounds like a stretch. But the last thing you want is to be caught empty-handed when the toilet springs a leak.\\n\\nEconomist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research says you should expect to set aside 1 percent of the purchase price for repairs and maintenance. If you buy a $350,000 home, plan to squirrel away $3,500. You may not need a dime of that money from one year to the next, but it sure is good to have just in case, he said.\\n\\nAutomate that savings by directing a percentage of your take-home pay to an account earmarked for housing expenses. If 1 percent is more than you can afford, try half that amount over 12 months. At the very least, you'll have some money to cover your repairs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConsider home warranties. Another way of addressing maintenance concerns is to purchase a home warranty, a service contract that will repair or replace things such as a broken furnace or dishwasher. You pay a quarterly or annual premium that's supposed to take care of those problems. When you buy a house, sometimes warranties are provided as part of the purchase. The thing is, you have to read the fine print.\\n\\nThese warranties often exclude existing problems, said Anthony Giorgianni, a writer for Consumer Reports. Sometimes it can be really tough to prove that an appliance that broke down didn't have that problem before you purchased the coverage.\\n\\nAnd sometimes there are exclusions where they'll cover the fridge, but not the ice-maker.\\n\\nBecause most companies use third-party contractors, the service can also be spotty, Giorgianni said. Still, if you buy an older home, the peace of mind might be worth the expense.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn the other hand, Giorgianni says putting the money you'd spend on a home warranty into an emergency fund gives you more flexibility.\\n\\nIf your appliances remain in tiptop shape, you still have money available for other housing needs.\\n\\nResearch additional insurance coverage. Within the first month or two of moving into your new home, you'll probably be inundated with offers for mortgage payment protection. This form of life insurance covers your monthly payments if you lose your job, become disabled or even die. It certainly offers peace of mind, especially if your health or job is shaky.\\n\\nFor someone who feels like they're at risk for having their employment interrupted or has a history of having to change jobs frequently, it might be advantageous, said Barry Zigas, director of housing policy at Consumer Federation of America. But disability insurance is probably a far better bet to cover expenses if you face disability on the job, and it covers far more than mortgage payments.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMake sure to read the fine print before signing anything. Some job-loss or disability policies cover payments for only up to two years. What's more, the value of the policy decreases as you repay your mortgage.\\n\\nZigas says the most important thing for consumers is to make sure they have good property-casualty insurance that protects their belongings in the event of a storm, fire or other catastrophe.\\n\\nAvoid piling up debt. After closing on a house, it's easy to get overwhelmed with the flurry of credit card offers that are sure to land in your mailbox. It's also tempting to use the credit cards you have to go on a furniture shopping spree. Pace yourself.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBe careful, Hoskins said. Wait several months before taking on any additional debt, until you become comfortable with that new mortgage payment.\\n\\nAD"}

{"original": "But Trump told congressional leaders he will not sign the measure, said incoming House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who attended the meeting.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president's not going to sign it . . . Now's the time to come together, find common ground and solve this problem, Mc­Carthy said. I didn't find the Democrats were wanting to negotiate today.\\n\\nThe closing of Washington's star attractions has left many tourists and furloughed locals frustrated with both President Trump and Congress. (Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has invited congressional leaders back to the White House on Friday for more discussions. But neither side offered any indication that a deal was within reach.\\n\\nThe jostling between Trump and top Democrats reflects how Washington's new balance of power will not immediately break the impasse that has shuttered large parts of the government since Dec. 22. And with no obvious path to a compromise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday said the shutdown could drag on for weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 12-day government shutdown has entered a new and unruly phase. Before the meeting, Trump leveled a series of false claims about immigration and the federal budget. Democrats countered by accusing the president of intransigence and said they would not yield to his demands.\\n\\nNo, construction hasn't begun on President Trump's wall and there is not funding to begin construction. (Meg Kelly/The Washington Post)\\n\\nWe have given the Republicans a chance to take 'yes' for an answer, Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) the expected incoming House speaker, said after the meeting. Earlier, Trump said the shutdown would go on as long as it takes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe shutdown's effects are spreading, particularly in the Washington region. The Smithsonian Institution closed its museums and the National Zoo on Wednesday. Trash and human waste are piling up at national parks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe District of Columbia has stopped issuing marriage licenses because of cutbacks to its funding, and the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a number of other agencies have suspended or scaled back a variety of services for families and businesses.\\n\\nAs Trump and Democrats scrap over the wall, both sides have all the power they need to block the other. Democrats can use their House majority — or a Senate filibuster — to stall any legislation that includes additional money for a wall. Trump can veto any bill that doesn't, and Senate Republicans have said they won't advance any legislation that lacks the president's blessing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump wants $5.6 billion for the construction of 200 miles of wall along the Mexican border. Some Republicans have suggested he would be willing to accept a lesser amount, but he tried to dismiss this idea on Wednesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe also rejected the negotiating position of his own top advisers. Vice President Pence in December approached Democrats with a compromise offer of $2.5 billion for border security and wall improvements. But Trump on Wednesday said he would never accept that deal.\\n\\nSomebody said $2.5 [billion], Trump said to reporters. No. Look, this is national security we're talking about.\\n\\nDemocrats have signaled a willingness to approve $1.3 billion for border security as part of a broader spending bill, and a portion of that money could be used to replace and repair existing sections of wall and fencing. But they have drawn the line at the use of any additional taxpayer money for the construction of a new wall.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president on Wednesday continued to advance false claims about where the wall money would come from and why it is needed.\\n\\nHe said the wall would be paid for by Mexico through savings to the United States under a new North American trade agreement. But the trade agreement has yet to be approved by Congress, and trade experts said such savings are uncertain.\\n\\nHe also wrote in a Twitter post that Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. This is also not true. Some walls and fencing have been replaced during the Trump administration, but there is little evidence that new barriers have been established along the 2,000-mile border.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd in remarks to reporters during a televised Cabinet meeting, Trump estimated there are between 30 million and 35 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. That number is roughly triple the estimate his own Department of Homeland Security offered several weeks ago.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPelosi is under extreme pressure from liberal groups not to give in to White House pressure for any wall funding. McCarthy said Trump wanted to have the next meeting on Friday, after leadership elections in Congress, and Trump has suggested Pelosi is opposing money for the border wall because she is worried about losing support from liberals.\\n\\nBut Pelosi has rejected the notion she is opposing the wall for purely political purposes, and many Democrats have rallied to her defense.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThroughout the 2016 presidential campaign and earlier in his presidency, Trump told voters he would build a concrete wall, 30 feet tall in most places, to keep people out. He also promised that Mexico would pay for the wall. Since becoming president, though, he has shifted this promise, saying the money must come from U.S. taxpayers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring the shutdown, Trump has offered much different descriptions of the barrier he wants to build along the Mexico border. He has said at times it would be a traditional wall, but he has also rejected the idea of a wall and described it as a series of steel slats. He recently offered a picture on Twitter of vertical posts with pointed tips, but other government officials said they were not planning to erect anything that looked like that.\\n\\nThe shutdown began after Trump rejected bipartisan congressional efforts to fund many operations through Feb. 8, insisting that any deal must contain wall money. His demand infuriated many Republicans who had been working to avoid a shutdown, but most have followed his lead and are insisting Democrats broker some sort of compromise.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats on Wednesday sought to ramp up pressure on Republicans to reopen the government, even suggesting they push off a debate about the border wall to a later date.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI said, 'Mr. President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said after the White House meeting. He could not give a good answer.\\n\\nTwo congressional aides briefed on the exchange said Trump told Schumer the president would look foolish if he backed down now. White House officials didn't respond to requests for comment on this exchange.\\n\\nDespite the far-reaching impacts of the shutdown, much of the federal government has not been touched. Major agencies such as the Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services have already been funded through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, thanks to spending bills passed by Congress last year.\\n\\nHouse Democrats on Thursday plan to pass two bills: one to fund the Department of Homeland Security at its current level through Feb. 8, which would continue the $1.3 billion in border barrier funding; and the other to fund the rest of the government through Sept. 30, at levels negotiated on a bipartisan basis in the Senate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat would make it possible for McConnell to send Trump a bill to reopen most of the government, while setting aside the fight over the wall.\\n\\nTrump and some conservative Republicans have said the fight over wall funding is necessary now because it's the best point of leverage, believing Democrats will rush to fund government programs and offer up some money in return for GOP votes. That has proved not to be the case.\\n\\nWednesday's meeting was crafted by the White House as an opportunity for DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to brief Democrats on problems along the Mexico border, but Democrats quickly interjected and said they wanted to talk about efforts to reopen the government.\\n\\nThe last time Schumer and Pelosi met Trump at the White House, on Dec. 11, it turned into a bizarre televised squabble during which Trump claimed he would be proud to shut down the government over the wall and insisted he would take ownership of any shutdown. The agencies that are unfunded and in shutdown mode include Homeland Security, which pays for the wall; as well as the departments of Agriculture, Justice, Interior, Transportation, State, and Housing and Urban Development. NASA is also partially shut down, along with the National Park Service and an array of smaller agencies.\\n\\nSome 800,000 federal workers are affected, including around 350,000 who have been furloughed while the rest stay on the job wondering whether they will end up getting paid. In past shutdowns, Congress has approved retroactive pay once the impasse has been resolved. But the many government contractors affected may never make up their lost paychecks.\\n\\nThe current shutdown is the longest since a 16-day partial shutdown in 2013 over the Affordable Care Act."}
{"original": "I never said we're doing it that quickly, but we're decimating ISIS, Trump told reporters Sunday morning as he headed for Camp David. With that being said, we're pulling out of Syria. But … we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat's a big but. It's also at odds with Trump's initial announcement that the U.S. would depart within 30 days and that the Islamic State has been defeated, not decimated.\\n\\nMeanwhile, visiting Jerusalem to reassure Israeli leaders on Sunday, White House national security adviser John Bolton acknowledged that pockets of the Islamic State remain undefeated and argued that a quick pullout could endanger U.S. forces. He pledged that the Kurds in Syria would be protected and added that the defense of Israel and other friends in the region is absolutely assured.\\n\\nThe timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement, Bolton said during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\n\\nNational security advisor John Bolton said on Jan. 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that Turkey will not target Kurdish forces. (Reuters)\\n\\n-- Two fresh data points from Sunday show that the Islamic State, while in retreat, has not been vanquished.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n1. A missile attack by the Islamic State wounded two British soldiers and killed at least one Kurdish fighter they were with in eastern Syria, per the AP. It's the first known casualty by coalition forces since Trump announced the pullout.\\n\\n2. Kurdish forces in Syria said Sunday that they had captured two American citizens hiding out in the country's final Islamic State stronghold, per Louisa Loveluck and Erin Cunningham. In a statement, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, identified the detainees as Warren Christopher Clark, 34, and Zaid Abed al-Hamid, 35. … In a sign of how far some of the group's members had traveled as their battlefields shrank, the SDF said Sunday that Clark and Hamid had been captured hundreds of miles from Mosul, in the Hajin area of eastern Syria. … Clark was a Texas resident and worked as a substitute teacher in the Houston area before traveling to Saudi Arabia and Turkey to teach English … He reportedly converted to Islam in 2004 and later became radicalized online.\\n\\n-- Moreover, the U.S.-led coalition appears to have ramped up active military operations in the wake of Trump's announcement. Between December 16 and December 29, US-led coalition military forces conducted 469 air and artillery strikes targeting ISIS in Syria, CNN reports. The strikes were carried out against ISIS fighters, buildings, oil facilities, vehicles, tunnels, weapons caches and improvised explosive device facilities … Prior to that period the coalition had been averaging about 200 strikes per week in Syria as fighting around the ISIS-held town of Hajin ramped up.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n-- Among the policy decisions still to be made is what to do about the tens of thousands of Syrian Kurdish fighters that U.S. forces have trained, armed and advised to carry out the ground war against the Islamic State, Karen DeYoung and Karoun Demirjian report. While Trump has expressed confidence that Turkey, which controls its own Syrian force opposed to both the Kurds and to President Bashar al-Assad, is capable of picking up the remaining fight against the Islamic State, Pentagon and State Department officials question Turkish priorities and capabilities. … Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stated repeatedly in recent months that driving Iran from Syria was also an objective for both the United States and Israel. But Trump appeared to indicate Sunday that both Iran and Russia, whose forces in Syria back Assad, were potential U.S. allies against the Islamic State.\\n\\nDuring a Jan. 2 Cabinet meeting, President Trump said his decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal had significantly weakened Iran. (The Washington Post)\\n\\n-- These are the kinds of significant questions that would typically be hashed out during an interagency process before a public announcement. A review of the timeline illustrates how erratic the Trump administration's rhetoric has been:\\n\\nDec. 14: What triggered all this was a phone call from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump was briefed before to warn the Turkish leader not to invade Syria, as he had been threatening to do, per David Ignatius. But Trump instead told Erdogan: 'You know what? It's yours. I'm leaving.'\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDec. 19: Trump announces the withdrawal. Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back, and they're coming back now, he said in a video posted to Twitter. We won.\\n\\nWe have defeated ISIS in Syria, Trump added, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.\\n\\nDec. 20: Jim Mattis resigned as defense secretary during what one senior administration official described that day as a disagreement in the Oval Office, in which Mattis sought to persuade the president to stand down on the Syria withdrawal but was rejected.\\n\\nGetting out of Syria was no surprise, Trump tweeted. I've been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. … Time to come home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIndeed, Trump had declared extemporaneously in March during a speech in Ohio: We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now! Then he backed off in the face of resistance from aides and the brass — just like he might be doing again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDec. 24: Trump declared that Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. The Saudis responded that they had not made any financial pledges since August, when the State Department announced that Riyadh had committed $100 million to a stabilization fund.\\n\\nDec. 26: Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his flight to Iraq that he would reject any request from generals to again extend his deadline for pulling out. They said again, recently, 'Can we have more time?' Trump said of U.S. generals. I said: 'Nope! You can't have any more time! You've had enough time!' We've knocked them out.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpeaking to the troops, Trump criticized their commanders for failing to meet the previous deadlines he set. We're no longer the suckers, folks, the president said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDec. 30: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters after eating lunch with Trump at the White House that the president reassured him the Syria decision was more of a pause situation than a withdrawal.\\n\\nDec. 31: ISIS is mostly gone, Trump tweeted. We're slowly sending our troops back home.\\n\\nJan. 3: Trump said during a Cabinet meeting that Iran's leadership can do what they want in Syria.\\n\\nJan. 4: In response to reports that Trump extended his deadline for pulling out from 30 days to four months, one of four senior administration officials speaking to reporters during a background briefing said, We have no timeline for our forces to withdraw from Syria.\\n\\nPresident Trump defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria during an unannounced visit to Iraq on Dec. 26. (The Washington Post)\\n\\n-- All these recalibrations have underscored just how rash that initial announcement was. Trump's words pack less of a punch when allies and adversaries alike take them less seriously. President Barack Obama also learned this the hard way when he said Assad using chemical weapons would be a red line and then didn't forcefully respond when he did.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n-- Cleanup on Aisle Nine: Senior administration officials are fanning out across the Middle East this week on a handholding mission to reassure anxious allies. Bolton will visit Turkey on Tuesday. Pompeo has stops scheduled in eight countries: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.\\n\\n-- For his part, Trump continues to insist on unflinching loyalty. The chief of staff at the Pentagon has been forced out of his post because of White House concerns about his close ties to Mattis, the Wall Street Journal's Gordon Lubold reports: The Pentagon announced that Kevin Sweeney, a retired Navy rear admiral who had worked closely with Mr. Mattis, had stepped down. … Mr. Sweeney had worked alongside Mr. Mattis at several points during his career, including when Mr. Mattis was still in uniform … The bond was a source of concern to the White House, the U.S. officials said, adding the appointment of Pat Shanahan as acting secretary by [Trump] last month was seen as an opportunity to remove Mr. Sweeney. …\\n\\nMr. Sweeney had expressed a desire to stay on at the Pentagon as recently as last week, per the Journal. Some officials believed he would provide continuity during the transition from Mr. Mattis to Mr. Shanahan. But, under pressure from the White House, Mr. Shanahan informed Mr. Sweeney on Friday that he was removing him as chief of staff Friday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\\n\\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\\n\\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\\n\\n-- Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book took home surprise honors at a Golden Globes ceremony marked by a Hollywood consensus on the need for industry change, television critic Hank Stuever reports. The stars are bored. It's their own fault, really, and it's mostly a good thing: They're woke and on board with Hollywood's attempts at a corrective course on diversity and equal rights, which is why Sunday night's telecast of the 76th annual Golden Globe Awards on NBC lacked the boozy, loosey-goosey tension of its renowned past. But is that really such a sacrifice, in exchange for solidarity?

In the television categories, Golden Globes went to FX's 'The Americans' (best drama, at long last); Netflix's 'The Kominsky Method' (best comedy, a very Golden Globes-kind of choice); and FX's 'The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story' (best limited series).

(Shibani Mahtani) A Christian ministry in South Carolina is requesting an exemption from the Trump administration to continue imposing a Christians-only rule for its foster-care program.

(AP)\\n\\nLawmakers from both parties discussed on Jan. 6 how a deal could be reached to end the government shutdown. (Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)\\n\\nSHUTDOWN LATEST:\\n\\n-- The Trump administration and Democratic leaders are still at an impasse over the border wall — signaling an indefinite continuation of the partial government shutdown that is now in its third week. Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report: As agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting White House budget director Russell T. Vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration's latest offer to end the shutdown. It demanded $5.7 billion 'for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border' but also proposed 'an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs' and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border. The administration has also signaled it would be willing to restore some version of an Obama-era program that allowed children in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to apply for refugee resettlement in the United States ...\\n\\nBut a border wall is 'central to any strategy,' Vought wrote, and Democrats — who have said the wall should not be tied to an agreement to reopen the government — remained skeptical of any overtures by the president, suggesting that there is no end in sight to the shutdown, which has entered its third week. A Democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the White House hasn't been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.\\n\\n-- Trump reiterated his threat to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall. Robert Costa, Felicia Sonmez and Nick Miroff report: Trump also said Sunday that he understood the predicament facing hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are not receiving their paychecks. 'I can relate, and I'm sure the people who are on the receiving end will make adjustments; they always do,' Trump said. He claimed that 'many of those people agree with what I'm doing': refusing to reopen the government without obtaining funding for his long-promised border wall. And he further backed away from the notion of a concrete wall, telling reporters that he has informed his staff to now say 'steel barrier.' \\n\\n-- White House officials have been looking into the possibility of declaring a national emergency at the border for weeks now, according to Bloomberg News's Justin Sink and Jennifer Jacobs. Some advisers close to Trump are recommending that he declare a national emergency, despite wide recognition that it would be immediately challenged in court. … But Trump's consideration of such an extraordinary step indicates that some in the White House see the gambit as the president's lone way to salvage his wall pledge as the consequences of the shutdown begin to amplify and talks with Democrats fall flat.\\n\\n-- Trump's press secretary left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency in a Fox News interview. From Politico's Victoria Guida: [Sarah] Sanders said Trump 'is prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders to protect the people of this country.' 'We're looking at exploring every option available that the president has,' she said. 'Whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful.' She also argued that the president isn't 'holding anybody hostage' by not signing legislation that would fund government agencies other than the Department of Homeland Security. 'He knows it's better if they can focus on getting all these packages done at once,' Sanders said.\\n\\n-- Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), who is up for reelection next year, said the Senate should vote on the funding bills passed in the House. From the Hill's Brett Samuels: Collins said on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that she understands [Mitch McConnell] is in a difficult spot because the president may not sign bills passed by the Democratic-held House, but pressed for a vote to reopen agencies like Agriculture, Interior, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. 'I'm frustrated in the situation that we've gotten to this point where both sides appear to be intransigent,' Collins said. 'It is not a sign of weakness to figure out a middle ground. I think that both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen and to compromise.'\\n\\nPeople are streaming into national parks to find trash cans overflowing and restrooms locked. Volunteers are stepping in to stop conditions from deteriorating. (Luis Velarde, Juca Favela/The Washington Post)\\n\\n-- Meanwhile, the effects of the shutdown are mounting. From Costa, Eilperin, Paletta and Miroff: The Department of Housing and Urban Development sent letters to 1,500 landlords Friday as part of a last-minute effort to prevent the eviction of thousands of tenants. A lot of those tenants live in units covered by a HUD program that many agency officials didn't realize had expired on Jan. 1 and that they are now unable to renew. … Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service officials are trying to determine whether they will be able to pay tax refunds next month, despite the fact that they said last year they would be prohibited from doing so in the event of a government shutdown.\\n\\n-- The National Park Service has decided to use entrance fees to pay for expanded operations at popular sites, an unprecedented step that some call illegal. Juliet Eilperin reports: Under a memorandum signed Saturday by the Interior Department's acting secretary, David Bernhardt ... park managers will be permitted to bring on additional staff to clean restrooms, haul trash, patrol the parks and open areas that have been shut during the more-than-two-week budget impasse. In a statement Sunday, National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith acknowledged that the administration's practice of keeping parks open but understaffed has become unsustainable at some of its most beloved sites. … Congressional Democrats and some park advocates question whether the park-fee move is legal, because the fees that parks collect under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are expressly designated to support visitor services instead of operations and basic maintenance.\\n\\n-- Small towns with federal workers are seeing the strain on local businesses. Heather May, Annie Gowen and Joel Achenbach report: Many of the affected federal workers — including 10,000 people in Utah, 6,200 in West Virginia and 5,500 in Alabama — have salaries far below the average $85,000 for government employees. But those paychecks drive local economies, and workers are starting to make tough choices about how to spend them — eating out less, limiting travel and shopping at food pantries instead of grocery stores — creating a ripple effect through the neighborhoods and towns where they live.\\n\\n-- Millions of food-stamp recipients could have their benefits disrupted if the shutdown drags past January. CBS News's Grace Segers reports: The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. Although SNAP is automatically renewed, it has not been allocated funding from Congress beyond January. Congress has appropriated $3 billion in emergency funds for SNAP distribution, but that would not cover all of February's obligations.\\n\\n-- Some federal prison employees expressed frustration about serving meals of steak and Cornish hen to inmates as they work without pay. Cleve R.

The feast was served by not-particularly-festive prison guards and workers who have no idea when they will receive their next paycheck — but who have to come to work anyway because they work in crucial public safety jobs.\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren campaigned in northwest Iowa as part of her inaugural appearances in the first presidential caucus state. (Alice Li/The Washington Post)\\n\\n2020 WATCH:\\n\\n-- Joe Biden is nearing a final decision on a 2020 presidential run. The New York Times's Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: [Biden] has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat [Trump], an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. … Yet Mr. Biden's skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and African-Americans are expected to run. … More broadly, debate around Mr. Biden's possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. … But Mr. Biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks.\\n\\n-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) zeroed in on her 2020 message during an Iowa visit as she conspicuously avoided using Trump's name. Annie Linskey and Chelsea Janes report: She aimed directly at voters tempted by [Trump's] angry populism in 2016 but avoided mentions of Trump himself almost entirely. … For Warren, virtually every position she advocated was, in policy terms, a repudiation of the president and the course he has set for the nation in his first two years. That was true from specifics — her demand that presidential candidates release their taxes, which the president has refused to do — to the generic — her repeated lament that the middle class has been hollowed out as economic and political fairness has been lost.\\n\\n-- Trump has become the silence between the notes of Warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy, David Weigel writes. When Warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the 'million dollars a day' that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. It's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.\\n\\n-- In a blog Warren wrote between 2005 and 2008, the then-Harvard law professor criticized Biden for a vote he cast in the Senate. NBC News's Jack Bohrer reports: In March of 2006, Warren wrote that Biden's 2005 vote in favor of the bankruptcy bill that spurred her foray into blogging made him part of 'a bi-partisan coalition to prefer powerful corporation [sic] over hard-working families.' 'For years, Senator Joe Biden vied with Republican Senators Charles Grassley and [Orrin] Hatch for head cheerleader for this bill,' Warren wrote. 'Even as he tried to position his national image as a strong supporter of women, Senator Biden was twisting arms to get the bankruptcy bill through Congress.'\\n\\n-- Warren's Senate colleagues are not jumping to endorse her — or any of her prospective challengers. Politico's Burgess Everett reports: Even Sen. Ed Markey isn't ready to endorse his fellow Massachusetts Democrat, at least not yet. 'When she is moving forward, we're going to be talking,' Markey said as he prepared for Warren's swearing in to another term in the Senate. 'I've just got to get today done.' Warren's hard-edged brand of progressive politics has annoyed some of her colleagues at times, but the lack of support from her caucus isn't personal. With a wide open Democratic primary, including perhaps a half-dozen of Warren's own colleagues set to join the race, there's no sense in getting out ahead of anyone, according to a dozen Democratic senators from across the ideological spectrum.\\n\\n-- Trump's campaign is devoting extensive resources to ensure the 2020 Republican convention is a smooth advertisement for his reelection. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: The president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. … For Trump adversaries, the possibilities for mischief in Charlotte would be endless. They could attempt headline-grabbing floor protests, demand prime-time speaking slots for presidential detractors, or even wage a long-shot bid to nominate someone else. The campaign is so focused on ensuring the convention is a smooth-running affair devoid of presidential critics that it's building out an entire wing of the campaign devoted solely to the endeavor. The initiative appears to be unique in both how early it's been launched and how far-reaching it is.\\n\\nThe U.S. military said on Jan. 6 it had killed Yemeni militant Jamal al-Badawi, a suspected planner of the deadly bombing of a Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. (Reuters)\\n\\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\\n\\n-- Trump tweeted that the al-Qaeda operative accused of organizing the 2000 bombing on the USS Cole, Jamal al-Badawi, was killed in a U.S. airstrike. Felicia Sonmez reports: U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, confirmed Badawi's death Sunday afternoon. … Seventeen American sailors were killed and more than 40 were injured in the Oct. 12, 2000, attack, in which al-Qaeda suicide bombers pulled up to the refueling destroyer in an explosives-laden boat and blasted a hole in its hull.\\n\\n-- With Trump seemingly offering to play the role of mediator, Serbia and Kosovo appear to inching closer to peace talks. Anne Gearan reports: Kosovo President Hashim Thaci made a previously unreported diplomatic trip to Berlin last month, where he met with U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell, a Trump confidant. Thaci pledged then that he would reverse course on punitive tariffs imposed on all Serb goods. … Serbia has never recognized Kosovo's independence and has warned of an armed intervention over the latest disagreements. … Trump sent personal letters to the leaders of both countries last month, urging them to return to peace talks and offering the possibility of a joint White House invitation.\\n\\n-- Trump's trade war is increasingly disrupting U.S. factory operations as more firms contemplate moving elsewhere. The New York Times's Peter S. Goodman reports: In the United States, factories that buy steel and aluminum — now more expensive — are struggling to pass on extra costs to their customers. Some are losing orders to overseas competitors that can buy metal free of American tariffs. Companies that import electronics and other parts are scrambling to remain profitable while exploring alternatives, such as moving plants beyond reach of the duties. … The tariffs have been sold to Americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the United States, abandoning China, Mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. But the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.\\n\\n-- A South Korean newspaper reported that Trump and Kim Jong Un may meet in Hanoi for a second nuclear summit. From Bloomberg News's Jihye Lee: U.S. officials have met their North Korean counterparts in Hanoi for discussions to adjust scheduling for the talks, [the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo] said, citing high-level diplomatic sources in Seoul and Washington it did not identify. … Vietnam is a long-standing ally of Pyongyang that has good relations with Washington. Speculation about the country's prospects as a summit site grew following North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho's visit there from Nov. 29-Dec. 2.\\n\\n-- A top royal adviser Saudi officials have named as a key suspect in the killing of Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi has dropped out of sight. Kareem Fahim reports: So in the seven weeks since [Saud al-Qahtani] was placed under investigation, only rumors have filled the silence. He was spotted recently in the coastal city of Jiddah, a resident said, and in the offices of the royal court here in the capital, according to a person who works with the government. Other accounts put Qahtani, once a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a remote corner of the kingdom, laying low. The government's treatment of Qahtani is being closely watched in Washington and other foreign capitals as a test of whether Saudi Arabia is sincere about prosecuting everyone found to be involved in Khashoggi's killing, including senior officials.\\n\\n-- Scientists say the high-pitched noise that diplomats in Havana complained about before displaying mysterious neurological symptoms may have been caused by one of the region's insects. The Guardian's Ian Sample reports: [A] fresh analysis of the audio recording has revealed what scientists in the UK and the US now believe is the true source of the piercing din: it is the song of the Indies short-tailed cricket, known formally as Anurogryllus celerinictus. … The identification of the sound source does not mean that an attack of some sort did not happen, but it casts doubt over the sound being responsible for the diplomats' health problems.\\n\\n-- British Prime Minister Theresa May urged Parliament members to back her Brexit deal when it comes up for another vote this month. Politico's Laura Kayali reports: She refused to rule out repeated votes on the same deal if she loses the first time round. … 'Don't let the search for the perfect Brexit be the enemy of the good,' May said, a reference to the criticisms of hard-line Brexiteers and EU supporters such as former European Commissioner Peter Mandelson, who argue the deal undermines British sovereignty and should be rejected. … May slammed MPs asking for a second referendum. 'It would divide our country and we wouldn't be able to organize a referendum before March 29 [when Brexit will take effect],' she said, pointing out it would therefore require an extension of Article 50 (the treaty article allowing withdrawals from the EU).\\n\\n-- If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, it could reverberate across other E.U. countries, including the Netherlands. Michael Birnbaum reports: The Netherlands — Britain's main trading partner on mainland Europe — is among the most-prepared for the possibility that Britons will leave the E.U. on March 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. Leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. And Britain's other trading partnerships in Europe could be even worse off. … Irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of Brexit. France is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.\\n\\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\\n\\n-- Democratic operatives with ties to a disinformation campaign in last year's Alabama Senate race, which was inspired by Russian tactics, are attempting to distance themselves from the effort. Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin report: Recent revelations about Project Birmingham … have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign. … But all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in [a document on the operation]. Project Birmingham got its funding from Internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.\\n\\n-- One Facebook page tied to the disinformation campaign impersonated Baptist prohibitionists who allegedly supported Republican Roy Moore's candidacy. The New York Times's Scott Shane and Alan Blinder report: The 'Dry Alabama' Facebook page, illustrated with stark images of car wrecks and videos of families ruined by drink, had a blunt message: Alcohol is the devil's work, and the state should ban it entirely. Along with a companion Twitter feed, the Facebook page appeared to be the work of Baptist teetotalers who supported [Moore]. 'Pray for Roy Moore,' one tweet exhorted. In fact, the Dry Alabama campaign, not previously reported, was the stealth creation of progressive Democrats who were out to defeat Mr. Moore — the second such secret effort to be unmasked.\\n\\n-- Nancy Pelosi downplayed the possibility that House Democrats would attempt to impeach Trump without bipartisan support to do so after hearing the findings from Robert Mueller's investigation. Brian Fung reports: Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. 'If and when the time comes for impeachment,' she said, 'it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way.' Pelosi's remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who said calls for Trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from Democrats' 'substantive agenda.'\\n\\n-- House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said he wants to share the panel's testimony transcripts with Mueller to determine whether any witnesses have committed perjury. I don't want to go into enumerating particularly who I have concerns about, but I do have concerns about certainly multiple witnesses, Schiff said on CNN. Bob Mueller, by virtue of the fact that he has been able to conduct this investigation using tools that we didn't have in our committee, meaning compulsion, is in a better position to determine, OK, who was telling the truth? Who wasn't? And who can I make a case against in terms of perjury?

{"original": "Why would the Taliban — a group known for the systematic destruction of women's access to education — not only agree to but initiate talks on the provision of education? The Taliban continues to fight the government of Afghanistan, and the armed group's political goal remains unchanged: To reestablish a strict Islamist system of government, a shift that would probably reverse many of the rights granted to women in the 2004 post-Taliban Constitution.\\n\\nThe group is in negotiations with the Afghan government in a bid to end the country's war. However, the Taliban did not get to the negotiating table through violence alone. Instead, the group waged a political campaign that required establishing support from Afghan citizens as well as a greater degree of international legitimacy — and both of these goals played into the recent decision to make a deal with UNICEF.\\n\\nThe Taliban seeks broader civilian support\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Taliban exercises control or influence over at least half of Afghanistan, and civilian support is important to the group's efforts to further consolidate control. Often during civil wars, armed groups provide services to civilians to win their support — and gain access to food, shelter, recruits and information. While armed groups could use force to extract these resources from civilians, territorial control leads armed groups to expect sustained interactions with civilians — and armed groups generally find it more efficient to develop a less coercive relationship with communities under their rule.\\n\\nThat shift seems to be taking place in Afghanistan. With many Afghans — 87 percent, according to one survey — believing that women should have the same educational opportunities as men, the Taliban has faced pressure from communities to change its policies toward education, which barred girls and women from schools in the past. The Taliban's change in strategy is in line with my research, which explains why armed groups tend to be pragmatic in their governance strategies, and how civilians often shape rebel governance. In Indonesia, for instance, religious leaders pushed GAM — an ethno-nationalist group that fought a war to form its own state — to adopt an increasingly religious agenda. This change helped the rebel group gain wider support from its religious constituency.\\n\\nCommunities in Afghanistan appear to be leveraging the Taliban's need for support and finding new ways to push back on the armed group's rules. Some experts attribute the shift in the Taliban's narrative on girls' schooling to pressure from communities that want their daughters to have access to education. These demands might have persuaded the Taliban to take a more flexible approach. In some cases, village elders made subtle threats that they would turn against the group and provide information to the Taliban's foes if the Taliban did not respect the community's wishes. However, pressure from civilians has its limits, and has in some cases been met with violence on the part of the Taliban.\\n\\nThe Taliban seeks international legitimacy\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut there's probably a second reason for the Taliban's deal with UNICEF. Collaborating with organizations like UNICEF, political science analysis shows, can bolster the Taliban's international legitimacy, carrying the symbolic significance of imitating a country's external relations. Mullah Akhtar Mansour, a previous leader of the Taliban, reportedly was aware that the Taliban needed recognition from the international community to realize its political ambitions.\\n\\nThe Taliban recognized the consequences of being perceived as a pariah state in the 1990s. Despite the Taliban's formal control of the government of Afghanistan from 1996-2001, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates formally recognized Taliban leadership. Two decades later, Taliban leadership has encouraged greater openness toward aid agencies, driven in large part by a hope for political recognition and an improvement in its public image.\\n\\nWhy now?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe drawdown of international troops is probably central to the Taliban's growing openness toward education. The Taliban has historically perceived education as an extension of the government and international forces. With the international troop presence now largely reduced, the Taliban may feel less threatened by foreign-funded activities like the opening of schools.\\n\\nThe dwindling numbers of foreign soldiers also means the Taliban can no longer generate civilian support through claims of defending Afghanistan from foreign invaders. Instead, the group might be trying to gain civilian support by demonstrating the group's governing capacity. As the primary authority in many areas, the Taliban might see its civilian support erode when it actively prevents access to public services such as education.\\n\\nThe current negotiations also place an added spotlight on the Taliban, raising questions among Afghans about how Taliban leaders will govern at the local level. The Taliban may thus see these factors as presenting an ideal time for the group to take actions that will bolster its international legitimacy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite the excitement surrounding the deal, it's not clear whether this marks a clear break with past Taliban policy. The Taliban's policies toward girls' education remain inconsistent and somewhat unpredictable — local commanders' approaches vary by personality and according to their relationship with the local community. As a teacher in Wardak province explained, Today, [a Taliban official] tells you that they allow girls up to sixth grade, but tomorrow, when someone else comes instead, he might not like girls' education.\\n\\nMore broadly, despite the leadership's rhetoric, the Taliban in the past has imposed tight restrictions on education for girls once they reach puberty, and it is difficult to find a secondary school open to girls in areas under Taliban control.\\n\\nA related concern is whether the program will be successful in actually reaching girls in rural communities. There's some evidence, however, that the community-based education strategy proposed by the deal has been effective in enabling girls to attend school in areas where they are unable to attend government schools because of insecurity, family resistance or community restrictions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile a surprise to many, the Taliban's deal with UNICEF suggests a growing recognition among Taliban leaders that the group will need to respond to the preferences of Afghans and the international community if it hopes to govern successfully."}

{"original": "The 3,600-word letter was largely prescriptive and spiritually oriented. It did not call for new measures to punish high-ranking clerics or hold them accountable — steps recommended by victim advocacy groups.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInstead, Francis made a case that the problem required more than stern decrees or improving flow charts, as if we were in charge of a department of human resources. He also referenced divisions within the U.S. ranks.\\n\\nPope Francis's 17-ton vehicle was flown to Panama City from Colombia on Dec. 28, as Panama prepared to host him for the Catholic Church's World Day of Youth. (Reuters)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLet us try to break the vicious circle of recrimination, undercutting and discrediting, by avoiding gossip and slander in the pursuit of a path of prayerful and contrite acceptance of our limitations and sins, Francis wrote.\\n\\nFrancis's letter came as the U.S. bishops were gathering for a week-long retreat focused on prayer and spiritual reflection at a seminary outside Chicago. That retreat, which is closed to the media, was suggested by Francis after he met in September with several U.S. Catholic leaders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor some Vatican watchers, the letter provided signals about how Francis is trying to guide the church through the most turbulent period of his papacy, while dealing with fractures — in the United States and beyond — over the reasons for the clerical abuse scourge. Francis has repeatedly connected the issue to abuses of power and clerics who have lost sight of their mission. But some church traditionalists say he has overlooked a problem of homosexuality in the priesthood.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTensions have grown between Rome and the U.S. church after a year of abuse-related scandals. When the pope was accused by a former diplomat of knowing about some of the alleged abuses of former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a handful of U.S. higher-ups said the accusations were credible. Subsequently, Francis did not green-light an investigation into McCarrick requested by the head of the U.S. bishops conference, Houston's Cardinal Daniel DiNardo. And the Vatican intervened to halt the U.S. bishops at their annual meeting in November from voting on new measures for handling abuse-related complaints.\\n\\nNext month, bishops from around the world will meet in Rome for a summit on sexual abuse and the protection of minors. Francis in his letter did not mention that gathering but called for a collegial and paternal response, rather than one in which some emerge as 'winners' and others not.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe pope urged the church leaders to acknowledge our hurt before the present situation and [let] ourselves together be summoned anew by God's word.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLook, I can understand the Catholics who might scoff and say, 'We don't need more discernment. We need action,'  said John Gehring, the Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life, an advocacy group in Washington. I think what the pope is saying is we need the deep discernment and the change of heart before we get to the policy.\\n\\nScandals in multiple countries over the past year have highlighted the church's struggle to deal with both abusive clerics and higher-ups who failed to stop them.\\n\\nAD"}

The object of the conspiracy was to hack into the computers of U.S. persons and entities\\n\\ninvolved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from those computers, and stage\\n\\nreleases of the stolen documents to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\n\\nManner and Means of the Conspiracv\\n\\nSnearphishing Operations\\n\\n21. ANTONOV, BADIN, YERMAKOV, LUKASHEV, and their co-conspirators targeted\\n\\nvictims using a technique known as spearphishing to steal Victims? passwords or otherwise gain\\n\\naccess to their computers. Beginning by at least March 2016, the Conspirators targeted over 300\\n\\nindividuals af?liated with the Clinton Campaign, and DNC.\\n\\na. For example, on or about March 19, 2016, LUKASHEV and his co?conspirators\\n\\ncreated and sent a spearphishing email to the chairman of the Clinton Campaign.\\n\\nLUKASHEV used the account ?john356g at an online service that abbreviated\\n\\nwebsite addresses (referred to as a ?URL-shortening service?).\\n\\nLUKASHEV used the account to mask a link contained in the spearphishin email,\\n\\nwhich directed the recipient to a GRU?created website. LUKASHEV altered the\\n\\nappearance of the sender email address in order to make it look like the email was\\n\\na security noti?cation from Google (a technique known as ?spoo?ng?), instructing\\n\\nthe user to change his password by clicking the embedded link. Those instructions\\n\\nWere followed. On or about March 21, 2016, LUKASHEV, YERMAKOV, and\\n\\ntheir co-conspirators stole the contents of the chairman?s email account, which\\n\\nconsisted of over 50,000 emails.\\n\\nb. Starting on or about March 19, 2016, LUKASHEV and his co?conspirators sent\\n\\nspearphishing emails to the personal accounts of other individuals af?liated with\\n\\nthe Clinton Campaign, including its campaign manager and a senior foreign policy\\n\\nadviser. On or about March 25, 2016, LUKASHEV used the same john356gh\\n\\naccount to mask additional links included in spearphishing emails sent to numerous\\n\\nindividuals af?liated with the Clinton Campaign, including Victims and 2.\\n\\nLUKASHEV sent these emails from the Russia-based email account\\n\\nhi.mymail@yandex.com that he spoofed to appear to be from Google.\\n\\n0. On or about March 28, 2016, YERMAKOV researched the names of Victims and\\n\\n2 and their association with Clinton on various social media sites. Through their\\n\\nspearphishing operations, LUKASI-IEV, YERMAKOV, and their co-conspirators\\n\\nsuccessfully stole email credentials and thousands of emails from numerous\\n\\nindividuals af?liated with the Clinton Campaign. Many of these stolen emails,\\n\\nincluding those from Victims and 2, were later released by the Conspirators\\n\\nthrough DCLeaks.\\n\\nd. On or about April 6, 2016, the Conspirators created an email account in the name\\n\\n(with a one-letter deviation from the actual spelling) of a known member of the\\n\\nClinton Campaign. The Conspirators then used that account to send spearphishing\\n\\nemails to the work accounts of more than thirty different Clinton Campaign\\n\\nemployees. In the spearphishing emails, LUKASHEV and his co-conspirators\\n\\nembedded a link purporting to direct the recipient to a document titled ?hillary?\\n\\nIn fact, this link directed the recipients? computers\\n\\nto a GRU?created website.\\n\\n22. The Conspirators spearphished individuals af?liated with the Clinton Campaign\\n\\nthroughout the summer of 2016. For example, on or about July 27, 2016, the Conspirators\\n\\nattempted after hours to spearphish for the ?rst time email accounts at a domain hosted by a third-\\n\\nparty provider and used by Clinton?s personal of?ce. At or around the same time, they also\\n\\ntargeted seventy-six email addresses at the domain for the Clinton Campaign.\\n\\nHacking into the Network\\n\\n23. Beginning in or around March 2016, the Conspirators, in addition to their spearphishing\\n\\nefforts, researched the and DNC computer networks to identify technical speci?cations and\\n\\nvulnerabilities.\\n\\nFor example, beginning on or about March 15, 2016, YERMAKOV ran a technical\\n\\nquery for the internet protocol con?gurations to identify connected devices.\\n\\n011 or about the same day, YERMAKOV searched for open-source information\\n\\nabout the DNC network, the Democratic Party, and Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nOn or about April 7, 2016, YERMAKOV ran a technical query for the\\n\\ninternet protocol con?gurations to identify connected devices.\\n\\n24. By in or around April 2016, Within days of searches regarding the\\n\\nthe Conspirators hacked into the computer network. Once they gained access, they\\n\\ninstalled and managed different types of malware to explore the network and steal data.\\n\\na.\\n\\nOn or about April 12, 2016, the Conspirators used the stolen credentials of a\\n\\nEmployee Employee to access the network.\\n\\nEmployee 1 had received a spearphishing email from the Conspirators on or about\\n\\nApril 6, 2016, and entered her password after clicking on the link.\\n\\nBetween in or around April 2016 and June 2016, the Conspirators installed multiple\\n\\nversions of their X-Agent malware on at least ten computers, which allowed\\n\\nthem to monitor individual employees? computer activity, steal passwords, and\\n\\nmaintain access to the network.\\n\\nc. X-Agent malware implanted on the network transmitted information from\\n\\nthe victims? computers to a GRU-leased server located in Arizona. The\\n\\nConspirators referred to this server as their panel. KOZACHEK,\\n\\nMALYSHEV, and their co-conspirators logged into the AMS panel to use\\n\\nX?Agent?s keylog and screenshot functions in the course of monitoring and\\n\\nsurveilling activity on the computers. The keylog function allowed the\\n\\nConspirators to capture keystrokes entered by employees. The screenshot\\n\\nfunction allowed the Conspirators to take pictures of the employees?\\n\\ncomputer screens.\\n\\n- d. For example, on or about April 14, 2016, the Conspirators repeatedly activated\\n\\nX-Agent?s keylog and screenshot functions to surveil Employee 1?s\\n\\ncomputer activity over the course of eight hours. During that time, the Conspirators\\n\\ncaptured Employee 1?s communications with co-workers and the passwords\\n\\nshe entered while working on fundraising and voter outreach projects. Similarly,\\n\\non or about April 22, 2016, the Conspirators activated X-Agent?s keylog and\\n\\nscreenshot functions to capture the discussions of another Employee\\n\\nEmployee about the ?nances, as well as her individual\\n\\nbanking information and other personal topics.\\n\\n25. On or about April 19, 2016, KOZACHEK, YERSHOV, and their co-conspirators remotely\\n\\ncon?gured an overseas computer to relay communications between X-Agent malware and the\\n\\nAMS panel and then tested X-Agent?s ability to connect to this computer. The Conspirators\\n\\nreferred to this computer as a ?middle server.? The middle server acted as a proxy to obscure the\\n\\nconnection between malware at the and the Conspirators? AMS panel. On or about April\\n\\n20, 2016, the Conspirators directed X-Agent malware on the computers to connect to this\\n\\nmiddle server and receive directions from the Conspirators.\\n\\nHacking into the DNC Network\\n\\n26. On or about April 18, 2016, the Conspirators hacked into the computers through\\n\\ntheir access to the network. The Conspirators then installed and managed different types\\n\\nof malware (as they did in the network) to explore the DNC network and steal documents.\\n\\na. On or about April 18, 2016, the Conspirators activated X-Agent?s keylog and\\n\\nscreenshot functions to steal credentials of a employee who was authorized\\n\\nto access the DNC network. The Conspirators hacked into the DNC network from\\n\\nthe network using stolen credentials. By in or around June 2016, they\\n\\ngained access to approximately thirty?three DNC computers.\\n\\nb. In or around April 2016, the Conspirators installed X-Agent malware on the DNC\\n\\nnetwork, including the same versions installed on the network.\\n\\nMALYSHEV and his co-conspirators monitored the X-Agent malware from the\\n\\nAMS panel and captured data from the victim computers. The AMS panel collected\\n\\nthousands of keylo and screenshot results from the and DNC computers,\\n\\nsuch as a screenshot and keystroke capture of Employee 2 viewing the\\n\\nonline banking information.\\n\\nTheft of and DNC Documents\\n\\n27. The Conspirators searched for and identi?ed computers within the and DNC\\n\\nnetworks that stored information related to the 2016 US. presidential election. For example, on\\n\\nor about April 15, 2016, the Conspirators searched one hacked computer for terms that\\n\\nincluded ?hillary,? ?cruz,? and ?trump.? The Conspirators also copied select folders,\\n\\nincluding ?Benghazi Investigations.? The Conspirators targeted computers containing information\\n\\n10\\n\\nsuch as opposition research and ?eld operation plans for the 2016 elections.\\n\\n28. To enable them to steal a large number of documents at once without detection, the\\n\\nConspirators used a publicly available tool to gather and compress multiple documents on the\\n\\nand DNC networks. The Conspirators then used other GRU malware, known as\\n\\n?X-Tunnel,? to move the stolen documents outside the and DNC networks through\\n\\nchannels.\\n\\na. For example, on or about April 22, 2016, the Conspirators compressed gigabytes\\n\\nof data from DNC computers, including opposition research. The Conspirators\\n\\nlater moved the compressed DNC data using X-Tunnel to a GRU-leased computer\\n\\nlocated in Illinois.\\n\\nb. On or about April 28, 2016, the Conspirators connected to and tested the same\\n\\ncomputer located in Illinois. Later that day, the Conspirators used X?Tunnel to\\n\\nconnect to that computer to steal additional documents from the network.\\n\\n29. Between on or about May 25, 2016 and June 1, 2016, the Conspirators hacked the DNC\\n\\nMicroso? Exchange Server and stole thousands of emails from the work accounts of DNC\\n\\nemployees. During that time, YERMAKOV researched PowerShell commands related to\\n\\naccessing and managing the Microsoft Exchange Server.\\n\\n30. On or about May 30, 2016, 1V1ALYSHEV accessed the AMS panel in order to upgrade\\n\\ncustom AMS software on the server. That day, the AMS panel received updates from\\n\\napproximately thirteen different X-Agent malware implants on and DNC computers.\\n\\n31. During the hacking of the and DNC networks, the Conspirators covered their tracks\\n\\nby intentionally deleting logs and computer ?les. For example, on or about May 13, 2016, the\\n\\nConspirators cleared the event logs from a DNC computer. On or about June 20, 2016, the\\n\\n11\\n\\nConspirators deleted logs from the AMS panel that documented their activities on the panel,\\n\\nincluding the login history.\\n\\nEfforts to Remain on the and DNC Networks\\n\\n32. Despite the Conspirators? efforts to hide their activity, beginning in or around May 2016,\\n\\nboth the and DNC became aware that they had been hacked and hired a security company\\n\\n(?Company to identify the extent of the intrusions. By in or around June 2016, Company 1\\n\\ntook steps to exclude intruders from the networks. Despite these efforts, a Linux?based version of\\n\\nX?Agent, programmed to communicate with the GRU?registered domain remained\\n\\non the DNC network until in or around October 2016.\\n\\n33. In response to Company 1?s efforts, the Conspirators took countermeasures to maintain\\n\\naccess to the and DNC networks.\\n\\na.\\n\\nOn or about May 31, 2016, YERMAKOV searched for open~source information\\n\\nabout Company 1 and its reporting on X-Agent and X-Tunnel. On or about June\\n\\n1, 2016, the Conspirators attempted to delete traces of their presence on the\\n\\nnetwork using the computer program CCleaner.\\n\\nOn or about June 14, 2016, the Conspirators registered the domain actblues.com,\\n\\nwhich mimicked the domain of a political fundraising platform that included a\\n\\ndonations page. Shortly thereafter, the Conspirators used stolen\\n\\ncredentials to modify the website and redirect Visitors to the actbluescom\\n\\ndomain.\\n\\nOn or about June 20, 2016, after Company 1 had disabled X-Agent on the\\n\\nnetwork, the Conspirators spent over seven hours unsuccessfully trying to connect\\n\\nto X-Agent. The Conspirators also tried to access the network using\\n\\npreviously stolen credentials.\\n\\nl2\\n\\n34. In or around September 2016, the Conspirators also successfully gained access to DNC\\n\\ncomputers hosted on a third-party cloud-computing service. These computers contained test\\n\\napplications related to the analytics. After conducting reconnaissance, the Conspirators\\n\\ngathered data by creating backups, or ?snapshots,? of the cloud-based systems using the\\n\\ncloud provider?s own technology. The Conspirators then moved the snapshots to cloud-based\\n\\naccounts they had registered with the same service, thereby stealing the data from the DNC.\\n\\nStolen Documents Released through DCLeaks\\n\\n35. More than a month before the release of any documents, the Conspirators constructed the\\n\\nonline persona DCLeaks to release and publicize stolen election-related documents. On or about\\n\\nApril 19, 2016, after attempting to register the domain electionleaks.com, the Conspirators\\n\\nregistered the domain dcleaks.com through a service that anonymized the registrant. The funds\\n\\nused to pay for the dcleaks.com domain originated from an account at an online\\n\\nservice that the Conspirators also used to fund the lease of a virtual private server registered with\\n\\nthe operational email account dirbinsaabol@mai1.com. The dirbinsaabol email account was also\\n\\nused to'register the john356gh URL-shortening account used by LUKASHEV to spearphish the\\n\\nClinton Campaign chairman and other campaign-related individuals.\\n\\n36. On or about June 8, 2016, the Conspirators launched the public website dcleaks.com, which\\n\\nthey used to release stolen emails. Before it shut down in or around March 2017, the site received\\n\\nover one million page Views. The Conspirators falsely claimed on the site that DCLeaks was\\n\\nstarted by a group of ?American hacktivists,? when in fact it was started by the Conspirators.\\n\\n37. Starting in or around June 2016 and continuing through the 2016 US. presidential election,\\n\\nthe Conspirators used DCLeaks to release emails stolen from individuals affiliated with the Clinton\\n\\nCampaign. The Conspirators also released documents they had stolen in other spearphishing\\n\\noperations, including those they had conducted in 2015 that collected emails from individuals\\n\\n13\\n\\naf?liated with the Republican Party.\\n\\n38. On or about June 8, 2016, and at approximately the same time that the dcleakscom website\\n\\nwas launched, the Conspirators created a DCLeaks Facebook page using a preexisting social media\\n\\naccount under the ?ctitious name ?Alice Donovan.? In addition to the DCLeaks acebook page,\\n\\nthe Conspirators used other social media accounts in the names of ?ctitious U.S. persons such as\\n\\n?Jason Scott? and ?Richard Gingrey? to promote the DCLeaks website. The Conspirators accessed\\n\\nthese accounts from computers managed by POTEMKIN and his co?conspirators.\\n\\n39. On or about June 8, 2016, the Conspirators created the Twitter account @dcleaksw. The\\n\\nConspirators operated the @dcleaks_ Twitter account from the same computer used for other\\n\\nefforts to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. For example, the Conspirators used\\n\\nthe same computer to operate the Twitter account @BaltimoreIsWhr, through which they\\n\\nencouraged U.S. audiences to ?[i]oin our flash mob? opposing Clinton and to post images with the\\n\\nhashtag #BlacksAgainstHillary.\\n\\nStolen Documents Released through Guccifer 2.0\\n\\n40. On or about June 14, 2016, the Company lupublicly announced that it\\n\\nhad been hacked by Russian government actors. In response, the Conspirators created the online\\n\\npersona Guccifer 2.0 and falsely claimed to be a lone Romanian hacker to undermine the\\n\\nallegations of Russian responsibility for the intrusion.\\n\\n41. On or about June 15, 2016, the Conspirators logged into a Moscow-based server used and\\n\\nmanaged by Unit 74455 and, between 4:19 PM and 4:56 PM Moscow Standard Time, searched\\n\\nfor certain words and phrases, including:\\n\\n14\\n\\n5' . -\\n\\n?some hundred sheets?\\n\\n?some hundreds of sheets?\\n\\ndcleaks\\n\\nilluminati\\n\\nmnpono useec'rnm? nepeaon\\n\\n[widely known translation]\\n\\n?worldwide known?\\n\\n?think twice about?\\n\\n?company?s competence?\\n\\n42. Later that day, at 7:02 PM Moscow Standard Time, the online persona Guccifer 2.0\\n\\npublished its ?rst post on a blog site created through WordPress. Titled servers hacked\\n\\nby a lone hacker,? the post used numerous English words and phrases that the Conspirators had\\n\\nsearched for earlier that day (bolded below):\\n\\nWorldwide known cyber security company [Company 1] announced that\\n\\nthe Democratic National Committee (DNC) servers had been hacked by\\n\\n?sophisticated? hacker groups.\\n\\nI?m very pleased the company appreciated my skills so .\\n\\nHere are just a few does from many thousands I extracted when hacking\\n\\ninto network. .\\n\\nSome hundred sheets! This?s a serious case, isn?t it? .\\n\\nI guess [Company 1] customers should think twice about company?s\\n\\ncompetence.\\n\\nthe Illuminati and their\\n\\n43. Between in or around June 2016 and October 2016, the Conspirators used Guccifer 2.0 to\\n\\nrelease documents through WordPress that they had stolen from the and DNC. The\\n\\nConspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, also shared stolen documents with certain individuals.\\n\\na. On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, received a\\n\\n15\\n\\nrequest for stolen documents from a candidate for the U.S. Congress. The\\n\\nConspirators responded using the Guccifer 2.0 persona and sent the candidate\\n\\nstolen documents related to the candidate?s opponent.\\n\\nb. On or about August 22, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, transferred\\n\\napproximately 2.5 gigabytes of data stolen from the to a then-registered state\\n\\nlobbyist and online source of political news. The stolen data included donor records\\n\\nand personal identifying information for more than 2,000 Democratic donors.\\n\\n0. On or about August 22, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent a\\n\\nreporter stolen documents pertaining to the Black Lives Matter movement. The\\n\\nreporter responded by discussing when to release the documents and offering to\\n\\nwrite an alticle about their release.\\n\\n44. The Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, also communicated with US. persons about the\\n\\nrelease of stolen documents. On or about August 15, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer\\n\\n2.0, wrote to a person who was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign\\n\\nof Donald J. Trump, ?thank for writing back . . . do ?nd anyt[h]ing interesting in the docs i\\n\\nposted?? On or about August 17, 2016, the Conspirators added, ?please tell me if i can help\\n\\nanyhow . . . it would be a great pleasure to me.? On or about September 9, 2016, the Conspirators,\\n\\nagain posing as Guccifer 2.0, referred to a stolen document posted online and asked the\\n\\nperson, ?what do think of the info on the turnout model for the democrats entire presidential\\n\\ncampaign.? The person responded, ?[p]retty standard.?\\n\\n45. The Conspirators conducted operations as Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks using overlapping\\n\\ncomputer infrastructure and financing.\\n\\na. For example, between on or about March 14, 2016 and April 28, 2016, the\\n\\n16\\n\\nConspirators used the same pool of bitcoin funds to purchase a virtual private\\n\\nnetwork account and to lease a server in Malaysia. In or around June\\n\\n2016, the Conspirators used the Malaysian server to host the dcleaks.com website.\\n\\nOn or about July 6, 2016, the Conspirators used the VPN to log into the\\n\\n@Guccifer_2 Twitter account. The Conspirators opened that VPN account from\\n\\nthe same server that was also used to register malicious domains for the hacking of\\n\\nthe and DNC networks.\\n\\nb. On or about June 27, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, contacted a\\n\\nU.S. reporter with an offer to provide stolen emails from ?Hillary Clinton?s staff.?\\n\\nThe Conspirators then sent the reporter the password to access a nonpublic,\\n\\npassword-protected portion of dcleaks.com containing emails stolen from Victim\\n\\nby LUKASHEV, YERMAKOV, and their co-conspirators in or around March\\n\\n2016. I\\n\\n46. On or about January 12, 2017, the Conspirators published a statement on the Guccifer 2.0\\n\\nWordPress blog, falsely claiming that the intrusions and release of stolen documents had ?totally\\n\\nno relation to the Russian government.?\\n\\nUse of Organization 1\\n\\n47. In order to expand their interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Conspirators\\n\\ntransferred many of the documents they stole from the DNC and the chairman of the Clinton\\n\\nCampaign to Organization 1. The Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, discussed the release of\\n\\nthe stolen documents and the timing of those releases with Organization 1 to heighten their impact\\n\\non the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\n\\na. On or about June 22, 2016, Organization I sent a private message to Guccifer 2.0\\n\\nto ?[s]end any new material [stolen from the here for us to review and it will\\n\\n17\\n\\nhave a much higher impact than what you are doing.? On or about July 6, 2016,\\n\\nOrganization 1 added, ?if you have anything hillary related we want it in the next\\n\\ntweo [sic] days prefable [sic] because the DNC [Democratic National Convention]\\n\\nis approaching and she will solidify bernie supporters behind her after.? The\\n\\nConspirators responded, ?0k . . . i see.? Organization 1 explained, ?we think trump\\n\\nhas only a 25% chance of winning against hillary . . . so con?ict between bernie\\n\\nand hillary is interesting.?\\n\\nb. After failed attempts to transfer the stolen documents starting in late June 2016, on\\n\\nor about July 14, 2016, the Conspirators, posing as Guccifer 2.0, sent\\n\\nOrganization 1 an email with an attachment titled ?wk linkl.txt.gpg.? The\\n\\nConspirators explained to Organization 1 that the ?le contained\\n\\ninstructions on how to access an online archive of stolen DNC documents. On or\\n\\nabout July 18, 2016, Organization 1 con?rmed it had ?the le or so archive? and\\n\\nwould make a release of the stolen documents ?this week.?\\n\\n48. On or about July 22, 2016, Organization 1 released over 20,000 emails and other\\n\\ndocuments stolen from the DNC network by the Conspirators. This release occurred\\n\\napproximately three days before the start of the Democratic National Convention. Organization 1\\n\\ndid not disclose Guccifer 2.0?s role in providing them. The latest-in?time email released through\\n\\nOrganization 1 was dated on or about May 25, 2016, approximately the same day the Conspirators\\n\\nhacked the DNC Microsoft Exchange Server.\\n\\n49. On or about October 7, 2016, Organization 1 released the ?rst set of emails from the\\n\\nchairman of the Clinton Campaign that had been stolen by LUKASHEV and his co~conspirators.\\n\\nBetween on or about October 7, 2016 and November 7, 2016, Organization 1 released\\n\\n18\\n\\napproximately thirty-three tranches of documents that had been stolen from the chairman of the\\n\\nClinton Campaign. In total, over 50,000 stolen documents were released.\\n\\nStatutory Allegations\\n\\n50. Paragraphs 1 through 49 of this Indictment are re?alleged and incorporated by reference as\\n\\nif fully set forth herein.\\n\\n51. From at least in or around March 2016 through November 2016, in the District of Columbia\\n\\nand elsewhere, Defendants ANTONOV, YERMAKOV, LUKASHEV,\\n\\nMORGACI-IEV, KOZACHEK, YERSHOV, MALYSHEV, OSADCHUK, and POTEMKJN,\\n\\ntogether with others known and unknown to the Grand Jury, knowingly and intentionally conspired\\n\\nto commit offenses against the United States, namely:\\n\\na. To knowingly access a computer without authorization and exceed authorized\\n\\naccess to a computer, and to obtain thereby information from a protected computer,\\n\\nwhere the value of the information obtained exceeded $5,000, in Violation of Title\\n\\n18, United States Code, Sections 1030(a)(2)(C) and 1030(c)(2)(B); and\\n\\nb. To knowingly cause the transmission of a program, information, code, and\\n\\ncommand, and as a result of such conduct, to intentionally cause damage without\\n\\nauthorization to a protected computer, and where the offense did cause and, if\\n\\ncompleted, would have caused, loss aggregating $5,000 in iralue to at least one\\n\\nperson during a one~year period from a related course of conduct affecting a\\n\\nprotected computer, and damage affecting at least ten protected computers during\\n\\na one-year period, in Violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections\\n\\n1030(a)(5)(A) and 1030(c)(4)(B).\\n\\n52.

Paragraphs 1 through 19, 21 through 49, and 55 are re?alleged and incorporated by reference\\n\\nas if fully set forth herein.\\n\\n57. To facilitate the purchase of infrastructure used in their hacking activity?including hacking\\n\\ninto the computers of U.S. persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and\\n\\nreleasing the stolen documents?the Defendants conspired to launder the equivalent of more than\\n\\n$95,000 through a web of transactions structured to capitalize on the perceived anonymity of\\n\\nsuch as bitcoin.\\n\\n58. Although the Conspirators caused transactions to be conducted in a variety of currencies,\\n\\nincluding U.S. dollars, they principally used bitcoin when purchasing servers, registering domains,\\n\\nand otherwise making payments in furtherance of hacking activity. Many of these payments were\\n\\n21\\n\\nprocessed by companies located in the United States that provided payment processing services to\\n\\nhosting companies, domain registrars, and other vendors both international and domestic. The use\\n\\nof bitcoin allowed the Conspirators to avoid direct relationships with traditional ?nancial\\n\\ninstitutions, allowing them to evade greater scrutiny of their identities and sources of funds.\\n\\n59. All bitcoin transactions are added to a public ledger called the Blockchain, but the\\n\\nBlockchain identi?es the parties to each transaction only by alpha?numeric identi?ers known as\\n\\nbitcoin addresses. To further avoid creating a centralized paper trail of all of their purchases, the\\n\\nConspirators purchased infrastructure using hundreds of different email accounts, in some cases\\n\\nusing a new account for each purchase. The Conspirators used ?ctitious names and addresses in\\n\\norder to obscure their identities and their links to Russia and the Russian government. For\\n\\nexample, the dcleaks.com domain was registered and paid for using the ?ctitious name ?Carrie\\n\\nFeehan? and an address in New York. In some cases, as part of the payment process, the\\n\\nConspirators provided vendors with nonsensical addresses such as ?usa Denver ?g?igh\\n\\nghihgfh and ?l 2 District of Columbia.?\\n\\n60. The Conspirators used several dedicated email accounts to track basic bitcoin transaction\\n\\ninformation and to facilitate bitcoin payments to vendors. One of these dedicated accounts,\\n\\nregistered with the username ?gfadel47,? received hundreds of bitcoin payment requests from\\n\\napproximately 100 different email accounts. For example, on or about February 1, 2016, the\\n\\ngfadel47 account received the instruction to ?[p]lease send exactly 0.026043 bitcoin to? a certain\\n\\nthirty-four character bitcoin address. Shortly thereafter, a transaction matching those exact\\n\\ninstructions was added to the Blockchain.\\n\\n61. On occasion, the Conspirators facilitated bitcoin payments using the same computers that\\n\\nthey used to conduct their hacking activity, including to create and send test spearphishing emails.\\n\\n22\\n\\nAdditionally, one of these dedicated accounts was used by the Conspirators in or around 2015 to\\n\\nrenew the registration of a domain encoded in certain X?Agent malware installed\\n\\non the DNC network. I\\n\\n62. The Conspirators funded the purchase of computer infrastructure for their hacking activity\\n\\nin part by ?mining? bitcoin. Individuals and entities can mine bitcoin by allowing their computing\\n\\npower to be used to verify and record payments on the bitcoin public ledger, a service for which\\n\\nthey are rewarded with freshly?minted bitcoin. The pool of bitcoin generated from the\\n\\nmining activity was used, for example, to pay a Romanian company to register the domain\\n\\ndcleaks.com through a payment processing company located in the United States.\\n\\n63. In addition to mining bitcoin, the Conspirators acquired bitcoin through a variety of means\\n\\ndesigned to obscure the origin of the funds. This included purchasing bitco in through peer-to-peer\\n\\nexchanges, moving funds through other digital currencies, and using pre-paid cards. They also\\n\\nenlisted the assistance of one or more third-party exchangers who facilitated layered transactions\\n\\nthrough digital currency exchange platforms providing heightened anonymity.\\n\\n64. The Conspirators used the same funding structure?end in some cases, the very same pool\\n\\nof funds?to purchase key accounts, servers, and domains used in their election-related hacking\\n\\nactivity.\\n\\na. The bitcoin mining operation that funded the registration payment for dcleaks.com\\n\\nalso sent newly-minted bitcoin to a bitcoin address controlled by ?Daniel Farell,?\\n\\nthe persona that was used to renew the domain The bitcoin mining\\n\\noperation also funded, through the same bitcoin address, the purchase of servers\\n\\nand domains used in the spearphishing operations, including accounts-\\n\\nqooqle.com and\\n\\n23\\n\\nb. On or about March 14, 2016, using funds in a bitcoin address, the Conspirators\\n\\npurchased a VPN account, which they later used to log into the @Guccifer_2\\n\\nTwitter account. The remaining funds from that bitcoin address were then used on\\n\\nor about April 28, 2016, to lease a Malaysian server that hosted the dcleaks.com\\n\\nwebsite.\\n\\n0. The Conspirators used a different set of ?ctitious names (including ?Ward\\n\\nDeClaur? and ?Mike Long?) to send bitcoin to a company in order to lease a\\n\\nserver used to administer X-Tunnel malware implanted on the and DNC\\n\\nnetworks, and to lease two servers used to hack the cloud network.\\n\\nStatutorv Allegations\\n\\n65.

Paragraph 18 of this Indictment relating to ALEKSANDR VLADIMIROVICH\\n\\nOSADCHUK is re?alleged and incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.\\n\\n68. Defendant ANATOLIY SERGEYEVICH KOVALEV (Koaanea AHaTonnii CepreeBnLr)\\n\\nwas an of?cer in the Russian military assigned to Unit 74455 who worked in the 22 Kirova\\n\\nStreet building (the Tower).\\n\\n69. Defendants OSADCHUK and KOVALEV were GRU of?cers who knowingly and\\n\\nintentionally conspired with each other and with persons, known and unknown to the Grand Jury,\\n\\nto hack into the computers of US. persons and entities responsible for the administration of 2016\\n\\nUS. elections, such as state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and US. companies that\\n\\nsupplied software and other technology related to the administration of US. elections.\\n\\nObiect of the Conspiracy\\n\\n70. The object of the conspiracy was to hack into protected computers of persons and entities\\n\\ncharged with the administration of the 2016 US. elections in order to access these computers and\\n\\nsteal voter data and other information stored on these computers.\\n\\nManner and Means of the Conspiracy\\n\\n71. In or around June 2016, KOVALEV and his co?conspirators researched domains used by\\n\\nUS. state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and other election-related entities for website\\n\\nvulnerabilities. KOVALEV and his co-conspirators also searched for state political party email\\n\\naddresses, including ?ltered queries for email addresses listed on state Republican Party websites.\\n\\n25\\n\\n72. In or around July 2016, KOVALEV and his co-conspirators hacked the website of a state\\n\\nboard of elections and stole information related to approximately 500,000 voters,\\n\\nincluding names, addresses, partial social security numbers, dates of birth, and driver?s license\\n\\nnumbers.\\n\\n73. In or around August 2016, KOVALEV and his co-conspirators hacked into the computers\\n\\nof a U.S. vendor (?Vendor that supplied software used to verify voter registration information\\n\\nfor the 2016 U.S. elections. KOVALEV and his co-conspirators used some of the same\\n\\ninfrastructure to hack into Vendor 1 that they had used to hack into SBOE 1.\\n\\n74. In or around August 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an alert about the\\n\\nhacking of SBOE 1 and identi?ed some of the infrastructure that was used to conduct the hacking.\\n\\nIn response, KOVALEV deleted his search history. KOVALEV and his co-conspirators also\\n\\ndeleted records from accounts used in their operations targeting state boards of elections and\\n\\nsimilar election-related entities.\\n\\n75. In or around October 2016, KOVALEV and his co-conspirators further targeted state and\\n\\ncounty of?ces responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. elections. For example, on or about\\n\\nOctober 28, 2016, KOVALEV and his co?conspirators visited the websites of certain counties in\\n\\nI Georgia, Iowa, and Florida to identify vulnerabilities.\\n\\n76. In or around November 2016 and prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, KOVALEV\\n\\nand his co-conspirators used an email account designed to look like a Vendor 1 email address to\\n\\nsend over 100 spearphishing emails to organizations and personnel involved in administering\\n\\nelections in numerous Florida counties. The spearphishing emails contained malware that the\\n\\nConspirators embedded into Word documents bearing Vendor 1?s logo.\\n\\nStatutory Allegations\\n\\n77.

{"original": "When they do, President Trump is quick to trash-talk them.\\n\\nThe new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House, went one broadside after the many departures among his top appointees were reported.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWrong! People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos, only great Energy!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the reporting he criticizes as false — he claims it is invented from sources that don't exist — is validated when top officials leave the White House staff and give on-the-record interviews.\\n\\nWhite House Chief of Staff John Kelly will be leaving his role in the coming months. Here's a look back at his tumultuous tenure. (Monica Akhtar, Joyce Koh, Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post)\\n\\nTake, for instance, an article based on an interview with just-departed Chief of Staff John F. Kelly by Molly O'Toole in the Dec. 30 Los Angeles Times, which carried some remarkable headline words: that Kelly's time as Trump's top aide is best measured by what the president did not do.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat Kelly was, in other words, often in the position of restraining a whimsical and incurious president.\\n\\nIf that sounds more like chaos than great energy, consider this passage from the same article:\\n\\nKelly faulted the administration for failing to follow procedure and failing to anticipate the public outrage for the two most controversial initiatives of his tenure: Trump's travel ban in January 2017, and the zero tolerance immigration policy and family separations this year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShortly after taking office, Trump issued an executive order immediately suspending the entire U.S. refugee program for 120 days, indefinitely freezing the entry of refugees from Syria and barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRefugees already approved for resettlement, green card holders and others were turned away from flights, detained, and in some cases deported. Federal judges issued emergency stays, and several iterations of the travel ban have been challenged in court.\\n\\nAt the time, despite reports he'd been caught off-guard by the president's order, Kelly gave a full-throated defense.\\n\\nI had very little opportunity to look at them before the orders were announced, Kelly acknowledged in The Times interview.\\n\\nIn other words, media reports that Kelly, then secretary of homeland security, had been caught off-guard by this impetuous blunder were accurate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd Kelly's defense, at that time, was a charade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's remarkable that Kelly now admits the chaos of travel ban implementation . . . when he previously lied to the public and press, CNN senior justice reporter Evan Perez said, responding on Twitter to the Los Angeles Times interview.\\n\\nPerez added: The reporting, it turns out, was spot on. Kelly was lying.\\n\\nAnd Maggie Haberman, a White House correspondent for the New York Times, made a broader point about the coverage overall: The current theme out of some in the WH comms shop is 'there's no chaos to see in this White House,' a narrative Trump has hoped will replace the actual reporting. This Kelly interview affirms most of the real-time reporting about how it is there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is far from the first time that top Trump officials have validated real-time reporting in after-the-fact interviews.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJust weeks ago, former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, in an interview with CBS News's Bob Schieffer, described the president as someone who is pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, isn't interested in deeply understanding policy decisions, and who repeatedly attempted to do illegal things. (Trump responded by calling Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, dumb as a rock.)\\n\\nThe situation Tillerson and Kelly have described is far closer to what the mainstream media reported than to what Trump claimed a few months ago: The White House is truly, as you would say, a well-oiled machine. It is working so well.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis doesn't mean, of course, that every anonymously sourced White House report turns out to be accurate to the letter. (After all, rumors of Kelly's departure circulated for months before he actually departed.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it does suggest that news reports describing high staff turnover, impulsive decision-making, an increasingly isolated chief executive and a chaotic atmosphere are valid. Far from being made up out of whole cloth, they are quite an accurate representation of an unsettling reality — despite what Trump would have us believe.\\n\\nIn a particularly unhinged-sounding tweet on Tuesday, the president sent New Year's greetings to the nation, including the fake news media.\\n\\nPresidential good wishes? Or just wishful thinking?"}
{"original": "Tax loopholes. Prescription drug pricing. Financial rules. Environmental protection. These companies define policies that are great for their bottom line, while good, honest people who work hard get squeezed harder every year. It's corruption, pure and simple.\\n\\nProgressive lawmakers such as Warren (D) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have long been critical of the relationship between members of Congress and the business interests who lobby them. Last year, a study published in the American Political Science Review painted a stark picture of how corporations have skewed Congress's perception of what the American public wants.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe study, by Alexander Hertel-Fernandez of Columbia University and Matto Mildenberger and Leah C. Stokes of the University of California at Santa Barbara, found that congressional staffers were terrible at estimating constituents' support for various policies. On nearly every issue surveyed — from gun control to environmental regulation to Obamacare — staffers in both parties believed the public was more conservative than they actually are.\\n\\nThe reason? Congressional offices pay a lot of attention to what big business groups are saying — especially when those groups give them money.\\n\\nWell over half of GOP staffers said that input from business groups was very or extremely important in shaping the policy advice they gave their bosses, the study found. Over a quarter of Democratic staffers said the same.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStaffer contact with these organizations may skew their perceptions of the public because the groups are more ideologically conservative than the public along the range of issues we study, the researchers wrote.\\n\\nMany staffers admitted changing their minds about a policy topic after speaking with a lobbying group that had given money to their boss's campaign. 45% of staffers agreed they had developed a new perspective about a policy after speaking with a group that provided campaign contributions to their Member, the authors write. This result suggests that a potentially large share of senior Congressional staffers have had their thinking about policy shaped by interest groups that provided their Member campaign contributions.\\n\\nAnd 62 percent of legislative staffers said they would view letters from employees of a hypothetical large company in their district as representative of public opinion, versus 32 percent who said the same about letters from ordinary constituents not identifying any business affiliation. Perhaps most strikingly, 1 in 10 staffers told the researchers letters from ordinary citizens were not at all representative of public opinion in their districts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think it's an outstanding paper, said Brendan Nyhan, a University of Michigan political scientist who was not involved with the study. The article avoids simplistic accounts of money buying votes and instead provides evidence that representational biases may originate in part from information provided by contributors and/or communication from business groups.\\n\\nThat representational bias may partly explain why Congress has often been willing to advance pro-business legislation even in the face of strong opposition from the public."}
{"original": "AD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut what to make of such statements? Does the government's coalition agreement suggest a radical departure from previous Austrian and European policies? In short, no — the government's plans are more similar than some may think. Here's what's on the agenda.\\n\\nReducing immigration to Europe\\n\\nTo no one's surprise, the new government calls for reducing immigration to Europe. In the second half of 2018, Austria will preside over the E.U. Council; the coalition agreement states that in that position, one priority will be protecting E.U. borders with the rest of the world.\\n\\nBut such policies are now mainstream in Austria and elsewhere. During the Austrian campaign, the defeated center-left Social Democrats (SPÖ) also demanded that the government win back control over immigration, proposing the protection of external European Union borders, a considerable reduction of immigration by 2020 and an increase in deportations — nothing too different from what the new ÖVP/FPÖ government supports.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNor is this program a departure from what's proposed by much of the rest of the E.U. Also Germany, generally seen as liberal on immigration, has aimed at substantially reducing immigration to Europe. The Austria-driven closure of the Balkan route and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's E.U.-Turkey agreement have worked together for this common end. Thus, the new Austrian government will likely be roughly in sync with other E.U. governments on immigration to Europe. This fact should not be overshadowed by Kurz's recent rejection of the E.U. quota system for distributing asylum seekers — a policy that has been a political nonstarter anyway.\\n\\nRestricting support for immigrants\\n\\nThe new government announced it wants to stop the private housing of asylum seekers, providing instead only centralized accommodation facilities. In addition, it wants to take their cash to help pay for basic provisions. The coalition also says it will substantially reduce minimum social welfare support for recognized asylum seekers and those granted subsidiary protection. Further, the government wants to adapt naturalization rules, which probably means making it harder for many (but not for all) to become an Austrian citizen.\\n\\nMany of these measures will severely constrain often-vulnerable immigrants. However, they do not break radically from past policies. For instance, in regional government coalitions with the ÖVP, even the Greens agreed to reduce minimum social welfare benefits for all recipients, often recognized asylum seekers. And Denmark and Switzerland, for example, already take cash from asylum seekers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCarrying out neoliberal changes\\n\\nThe new government also announced important changes to Austria's economic, social and educational policies. It plans to cut unemployment benefits and further aid; to increase the maximum working day to 12 hours and to reduce corporate taxes. Austria already has a statutory budget deficit limit; the new government plans to install that in constitutional law.\\n\\nÖVP and FPÖ also want to begin charging students for attending universities — right now, Austria's public universities are mostly free — although that might be offset with tax exemptions after graduation. They want to ratify CETA, a controversial economic agreement between the European Union and Canada, and to gut the Chamber of Labor, a statutory interest group with compulsory membership for Austrian employees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHad the SPÖ joined the government, it would have nixed some of these policies. Still, none of them represent a radical break. Many European countries — and not just those with right-wing governments — have introduced measures like budget deficit limits and welfare state cutbacks.\\n\\nThe possibility of democratic backsliding\\n\\nHow will the new government affect democratic standards? Should we even expect a turn to illiberal democracy?\\n\\nThe FPÖ is now in charge of key ministries, with political control over police, army and intelligence agencies. At the same time, important FPÖ figures are well-embedded in far-right circles. There, they recruit for leading positions in ministries and state-owned enterprises.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat previous right-wing government was also notorious for corruption affairs. Most prominently, a former finance minister was accused of profiting from the privatization of state-owned real estate and is currently on trial.\\n\\nThus, there's certainly potential for serious political misconduct, even within the boundaries of what is typically defined as liberal democracy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWeak opposition\\n\\nIn parliament, the Social Democrats have stopped opposing future coalitions with the FPÖ — and so have less credibility for calling for outrage. In 2000, Europe's Social Democratic parties could still push E.U. members to diplomatically sanction the first ÖVP/FPÖ coalition. That won't happen this year either.\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "I was mad about the hit TV series Mad Men. So I hope Jon Hamm, the lead actor in the drama, doesn't take this the wrong way.\\n\\nI'm not a fan of his shilling to get people to get a tax refund-related loan. Hamm stars in several commercials for H&R Block. They want your business. Okay, fine. The ads are cute because, well, Hamm is so fine.\\n\\nBut in one of the commercials, Hamm is on a movie set eating a meal with a woman made up like a zombie. Here's their dialogue.\\n\\nHamm: Hey, here's an idea. What if instead of waiting weeks for your tax refund, you could get an advance on that refund?\\n\\nZombie woman: An advance on my tax refund. I could really use that.\\n\\nHamm: What would you do with that money?\\n\\nZombie woman: I'd like to take a tropical holiday.\\n\\nHamm: I'd be careful with your skin tone.\\n\\nZombie woman, laughing: I get it, because I'm a zombie.\\n\\nHamm wraps up the commercial with the tag: Don't just get your taxes done. Get your taxes won.\\n\\nThis type of loan will be appealing to a lot of folks because, this tax season, a lot of refunds will be delayed. In 2015, Congress passed the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act, which aimed to curb errors and fraud involving the earned income tax credit or additional child tax credit.\\n\\nBecause of the law, the Internal Revenue Service cannot issue a refund on tax returns claiming either credit until Feb. 15. People who have filed early and are claiming the EITC or ACTC should not expect their refunds until the week of Feb. 27, according to the IRS.\\n\\nH&R Block is offering zero percent refund advance loans in the amounts of $500, $750 or $1,250, depending on eligibility. Another company, Jackson Hewitt, is promoting a similar Express Refund Advance of up to $1,300.\\n\\nKeep in mind that these are loans backed by your refund. Although the rate is zero percent, I'm concerned about the upsell that could tack on other costs for taxpayers. In fine print on its website, H&R Block says: Fees for other optional products or product features may apply.\\n\\nHere's the deal: To get access to a loan, people have to first pay to get their taxes done. And the loan disbursement is placed on a prepaid card, which, depending on how people withdraw their money, could come with fees.\\n\\nCertainly these loans are better than their cousins: refund-anticipation loans, or RALs, which used to generate millions in fees for tax-preparation companies. Thankfully, as the popularity of e-filing and directly deposited refunds took off, the appeal of these costly loans faded.\\n\\nNo one can get your full refund to you faster than the IRS, said David Sieminski, policy analyst at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Be careful to look at all the terms of any type of 'refund advance' before agreeing to accept one.\\n\\nI get that doing your taxes can be intimidating. You may not feel capable of doing it yourself, so you hire someone to file your return. But at least investigate free preparation and filing options.\\n\\nThe IRS's Free File preparation and e-filing assistance is available to taxpayers who have a 2016 adjusted gross income of $64,000 or less. Go to IRS.gov/freefile. The agency's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program offers free filing to people with incomes below $54,000, people with disabilities or those who are not proficient in English. The IRS's Tax Counseling for the Elderly program also offers free tax help. The AARP Foundation's Tax-Aide program offers help at no cost to anyone who cannot afford a tax-preparation service. You can find a local Tax-Aide site at AARP.org.\\n\\nThe CFPB has a post ( bit.ly/cfpb_blogtips) with tips and links about filing your return and information on free preparation services.\\n\\nIf you want to check on the status of your refund, go to irs.gov and search for Where's My Refund? or use the IRS2Go mobile app. The agency says both portals will be updated with projected deposit dates for early EITC and ACTC refund filers a few days after Feb. 15.\\n\\nTechnically, as advertised, the tax refund advances seem like a deal. I understand that people want and need their money fast. In the end, however, being in a rush to get your refund may cost more than you should spend. And that's money you could save toward a vacation.\\n\\nWrite Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.

{"original": "With her divisive confirmation hearing and Vice President Pence's tie-breaking vote to secure her place in President Trump's Cabinet, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos turned national headlines toward public education for the first time in years. Her platform is singular: school choice. Her education efforts in the past focused on expanding school choice for students in Michigan, including charter schools run by for-profit companies, vouchers for independent and religious schools and more. While our organization strongly supports school choice, we know that without appropriate accountability mechanisms, school choice means a dangerous gamble for underserved students. When pushed by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), DeVos famously dodged his questions about equal accountability for all schools receiving federal funds.\\n\\nLuckily, there is much that DeVos can learn here in her new back yard of Washington.\\n\\nNot far from the Capitol, she'll find Gonzaga College High School, where the Higher Achievement Program was founded in 1975 on the principle of school choice. Our founder, a teacher at Gonzaga — Greg Gannon — saw the outstanding education inside the school's walls and the dearth of opportunity in the surrounding neighborhood, and he took action. Through its rigorous, multi-year after-school and summer programs, Higher Achievement has helped place thousands of students in top high schools in Washington, Baltimore, Richmond and Pittsburgh.\\n\\nOur program is agnostic on school type: private, parochial, charter or public. What matters most is that the school is the best choice for each child. Every year, we place budding performers at Duke Ellington School of the Arts (an arts-based public magnet school in Georgetown); future senators at Thurgood Marshall Academy (a law- and justice-focused charter school in Anacostia); intellectuals at Benjamin Banneker Academic High School (a public school near Howard University) and activists at Sidwell Friends School (a private, independent school in Northwest Washington); and, following our history, many of our boys continue to be placed at Gonzaga.\\n\\nWe are proud that 85 percent of our scholars attend a top-tier high school, most of them public or public charters, and 95 percent graduate from high school on time (nearly double the rate of their peers).\\n\\nThese outcomes are impressive. But they require an environment of strong choices and supports for families to make informed decisions. We meet one-on-one with families of middle-school students every week for months to ensure that they understand their education options and can meaningfully help their children apply to schools.\\n\\nTen years ago, charter schools were proliferating in Washington without proper accountability. I witnessed questionable charter operators attempting to attract our scholars and families to attend their low-performing schools. These charters were allowed to operate with abysmal test scores and without basic safety in classrooms. More recently with new leadership, the D.C. Public Charter School Board has become a national model. Poor schools are forced to improve or are closed; excellent schools are encouraged to expand.\\n\\nWashington is often home to congressional public policy experiments, and it has operated a voucher program for several years. I've witnessed enterprising, low-income families take full advantage of vouchers. Many parents work multiple jobs and cobble together vouchers, scholarships and tuition payments to cover the costs of independent schools. While vouchers can open doors to strong schools to underserved students in rare instances, this approach also allows public dollars to flow to private schools without full transparency about their results (test scores, graduation rates, college matriculation rates). Certainly, they do not get equal accountability.\\n\\nSchool choice is complex. For choice to change the odds for students, it must be paired with accountability and transparency."}
{"original": "Simonds, a Democrat who may still challenge the outcome, had thought she lost the race for the Virginia House of Delegates by 10 votes on election night, only to learn after a recount that she had won by a single vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRepublican David Yancey won a drawing on Jan. 4 in a contested race in the Virginia House of Delegates. (Erin Patrick O'Connor, Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe astonishing turn momentarily threatened the GOP's 18-year majority in the House of Delegates and transformed Simonds into an improbable, if fleeting, star of cable news shows.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Democrats' euphoria was soon quashed when a judicial panel ruled the race a tie — 11,608 votes each — and left its outcome to the whims of a lottery. A state election official on Thursday picked the name of the winner — Republican David E. Yancey — from what may now be the country's most photographed ceramic bowl.\\n\\nI'm probably stuck in the anger phase, Simonds said over lunch the next day, reflecting on a two-month saga in which she found herself evolving from a political unknown to the inspiration for the Twitter hashtag #StandwithShelly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith Virginia's General Assembly convening Wednesday, Simonds, 50, is contemplating whether to exercise her last remaining option: a second recount. She has until Jan. 16.\\n\\nHers is not the only House race shrouded in uncertainty. Democrats are appealing a federal judge's denial of their request for a special election in District 28, in which 147 voters received ballots with the wrong candidates listed. Republican Bob Thomas won the race against Democrat Joshua Cole by 73 votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhatever her choice, Simonds said she's preparing to begin fundraising to challenge Yancey in 2019.\\n\\nThis seat is mine; I am running again, Simonds said. She said her resolve has been fortified by her post-election journey, one that included a three- judge panel allowing a contested ballot to be counted for Yancey, upending what she had thought was her one-vote victory.\\n\\nIt was 'Every vote counts,' a beautiful story, and then it morphs into a darker story — you can play tricks and a judge can decide an election, she said between forkfuls of pasta. I am part of the Democratic blue wave. We're fed up with the old boys network, and the judges represent that. They can't do business as usual in Richmond from here on out.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats had flipped 15 House seats in November, decimating the iron grip that Republicans had held over the chamber and bringing the political parties to near parity. Republicans now hold 51 seats to Democrats' 49.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the uncertainty surrounding the 28th District, as well as the 94th District, where Yancey and Simonds ran, could shift that balance.\\n\\nIf the federal appeals court orders a new election in the 28th District, for example, and Thomas is not seated in the General Assembly on Wednesday, the GOP advantage shrinks to 50 to 49.\\n\\nIf Simonds were also to seek a recount, blocking Yancey from being seated as the session begins, the body would be tied 49 to 49. Republicans would be forced to enter into a power-sharing arrangement with Democrats on the first day, when lawmakers elect a speaker, decide committee chairs and set rules.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a statement following the lottery won by Yancey, Del. M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights), who would be House speaker if the GOP maintains a majority, described the post-election tribulations as unprecedented to say the least, but the process laid out in state law worked. Now, it's time to get to work.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe annals of American politics are littered with politicians defined by soul-crushing defeats. Republican New York Gov. Thomas E. Dewey, for one, lost the 1948 presidential race despite many projections and at least one headline to the contrary (Dewey Defeats Truman). Al Gore's razor-thin loss to George W. Bush in 2000 still conjures teeth-gnashing angst among Democrats.\\n\\nNeither Dewey nor Gore ran for the White House again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhether Simonds's electoral misfortune can eventually help her capture a General Assembly seat is an open question. At the very least, her roller coaster of a ride — one that included enough stomach-churning turns to require a robust dose of Dramamine — has made her better known than if she had won or lost by, say, 1,000 votes.\\n\\nThere is no better way to lose than the way she lost, said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center of Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. This is her moment. A lot of her supporters are angry. She has a lot of momentum behind her.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet, Simonds's path is not without risks, Kidd said. If she seeks a second recount, she may signal to voters that she's a loser who didn't want to accept it, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRobert Holsworth, a retired Virginia Commonwealth University political science professor, said Simonds's challenge is to galvanize voters by latching on to an issue that has nothing to do with her electoral misadventure.\\n\\nPeople don't vote because of sympathy they have for you, Holsworth said. They want to know what you're going to do for them.\\n\\nBy any measure, the drama that Simonds has endured since November is not what she is accustomed to as a yoga-practicing mother of two daughters. An Ohio native, she moved to Newport News in 2000 when her husband, Paul, an engineer, got a job at NASA.\\n\\nSimonds entered politics only six years ago, when a friend persuaded her to run for a school board seat that she won by what in retrospect seems like an ample 174 votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWomen need to be asked to run, Simonds said, explaining the roots of her first campaign. Women are taught as girls to be part of the team, be part of the family, not necessarily to demand the attention of everyone.\\n\\nSimonds relished her new role enough that she campaigned for Yancey's House seat in 2015, a race she lost by 2,000 votes. If she was unsure about exposing her family to the rigors of another campaign, Simonds said President Trump's 2016 election motivated her to challenge Yancey again.\\n\\nI felt this urgency, she said. I was much more assertive and aggressive.\\n\\nThe past couple of months have been rife with moments she's not eager to relive, such as when she learned that the judicial panel had nullified her one-vote victory and declared the race tied. I had been so excited about getting up to the General Assembly and thinking about legislation I'd introduce, she said. That was the hardest day.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe lottery drawing was also painful, even before she knew the outcome, because she knew the result could be challenged. If I won, was I really going to win? she said. I almost felt like a lamb being led to slaughter.\\n\\nHer list of what-might-have-beens includes something that has nothing to do with ceramic bowls or recounts.\\n\\nIt's the unopened cardboard box she found in her campaign headquarters days after the election. Inside were the names and addresses of hundreds of targeted voters her volunteers needed to reach on Election Day to get them to the polls.\\n\\nNo one from her campaign had knocked on those doors.\\n\\nWith the election so close, Simonds knows that a handful of those voters could have made the difference.\\n\\nI was stunned when I found that box, Simonds said.\\n\\nHer foray in the political spotlight has also included pinch-me moments, such as when MSNBC sent a chauffeur-driven SUV to deliver her to an interview with Lawrence O'Donnell.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOr when she realized during another interview that she was being broadcast live in London.\\n\\nThen there was the delight she felt when, after she lost the drawing, humorist Samantha Bee tweeted to her 479,000 followers that she was currently smashing bowls in her kitchen in solidarity with @shelly_simonds.\\n\\nThis made me laugh so hard, at a moment when I really needed a laugh, Simonds tweeted in reply.\\n\\nReflecting on her newfound infamy, Simonds joked about the idea of getting herself a L-O-S-E-R tattoo.\\n\\nBut she emphasized that the tattoo would be temporary.\\n\\nThen I can replace it with 'W-I-N-N-E-R,'  she said. I am not a loser."}

{"original": "I just want what is best for him, she said, pointing out her son, who was at that moment climbing up the slide, preventing the gaggle of children atop the play scape from coming down. She laughed and blew him a kiss.\\n\\nI silently disdained her. But am I any better?\\n\\nParents are praised for giving kids the steady-eyed, unconditional I'll help you bury the body kind of love. We feel, on an almost visceral level, that there is nothing we wouldn't do for our kids. But does chasing that ideal create a less ideal world?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy husband and I are the product of public school educations. We both spent our early careers working at nonprofit groups aimed at improving education, and went to law school with the intention of learning how to improve education policy. We know that schools thrive when families are active and engaged. And we vowed to be part of the solution.\\n\\nYet when it came time for us to decide upon our first child's education, we balked. We were walking by our local school one day and saw an 8-year-old boy pull a long strand of wire from the decaying fence and use it as a sword in a battle with another child, who said I'm going to kill you. Meanwhile, a burned-out teacher barely looked up.\\n\\nMy husband paused and said, I'm just not sure I can stomach sending our daughter here.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe school decision highlights the problem at the heart of moral parenting. We want to teach our children to be ethical, yet is parenting in itself a constant choice between what is best for our individual child and what is best for all children?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAre we, for example, obligated to send our child to a low-performing school because if we don't, we are participating in the failure and neglect of underperforming schools? Or are we obligated to send our children to the best school that we can provide? Is all of parenting a distortion of the classic trolley problem?\\n\\nBritish philosopher Philippa Foot's famous thought experiment asks people to imagine themselves waiting on the platform of a trolley station. Suddenly, you notice a runaway trolley barreling toward five people who are tied to the tracks. As you stand there, witnessing the certain tragedy, you also notice a lever. If you pull the lever, you can divert the trolley to another track, where there is only one person. You have two options: Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track. Or pull the lever, diverting the trolley, where it will kill one person. Do you kill one to save five? What if, rather than a lever, the only way to stop the trolley is to push a man onto the track? What if that man is a villain? Do you do it then? What if the man is a stranger? A friend?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow what if your child is tied to the tracks? For most of us, there is no longer a question. That changes everything.\\n\\nAs society becomes more individualistic, we have less accountability for putting our children's needs above the needs of all. This shift can also be attributed to how the family landscape is constantly changing. Parents are tasked with co-parenting in arrangements that often don't follow the institutional blueprints of generations past.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the same time, parenting anxiety is at an all-time high. A complete reordering of the skills and technologies that affect our economy has left many parents feeling like we are preparing our children for life on a planet we have not even visited. That makes it tough to dismiss the allure of being The Best, as that at least feels familiar. So parents worry about getting their kid into the right preschool, or how to hire expensive SAT tutors, or how they can pull strings to procure choice internships.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut at a time when parenting options are limitless, information is overabundant, we are navigating without the rudder of convention or predictability and we are gifted with the privilege of choice, where do we draw the line?\\n\\nIn another famous thought experiment, philosopher John Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves living behind a veil of ignorance. In this world, we are unaware of our personal details, political systems and laws. We don't know if we are billionaires in Palo Alto or street merchants in New Delhi.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe are then asked: Which society best suits your needs?\\n\\nThe most rational choice is a system that guarantees the basic rights and liberties needed to secure the interests of free and equal citizens. We would naturally seek equal educational opportunities that would allow everyone to fairly compete and maintain self-respect. So why, when we consider what we want for our children, would we potentially choose something other than the path that provides that?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor many years, I pictured this thought experiment set in a jury chamber, where a group of individuals is stripped of status and permitted to deliberate upon only the information handed to them. But as my life has filled with images of hospital nurseries, with their the rows of bald and oblivious babies; and schoolrooms, filled with their rows of dimpled hands clasping No. 2 pencils, it's not difficult to see that parenting puts us in the middle of this experiment. As parents, we have to help create the world we want our children to live in.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA year after the scene at the playground, I was sipping home-brewed coffee across the kitchen table from two women I had just met. Our daughters were awkwardly stealing glimpses of one another over an art project meant to be an icebreaker. The girls were about to start kindergarten at a public magnet school.\\n\\nThese moms are bright women who don't see the school's low test scores as a deterrent. They are enamored with the culturally and economically diverse school where nature, language and music will play leading roles. They are rewriting best as something that doesn't involve winning. And finally, I realize what's been bothering me for the past year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLife cannot be won. And I am not so sure that we are doing an adequate job of teaching our kids that.\\n\\nMaybe it is our insecurities, as we parent beyond tradition and beyond the known toward something that we can't quite make out in the distance. Or the sinking feeling that, although we are working more than ever, our financial pressures are at an all-time high. But if we are defining our greater sense of We're okay by how successful our children appear, then we are failing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe need to be honest about our anxieties, take responsibility for our choices and refuse to let the ends justify the means. Our intense drive to protect our children cannot be the reason we make the world less virtuous. Rather, we should use the virtuous love and fierce drive to protect our children as motivation to make the world a place where all children can thrive.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nElizabeth Small is a lawyer, freelance writer and mother based in West Hartford, Conn.

{"original": "Meanwhile, Gov. Larry Hogan (R), whose national profile has taken off since his decisive reelection, has pledged to continue to reach across the aisle to lower student debt, attract and retain jobs, increase development in urban areas, improve education and reduce crime.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith a large freshman class, including a record number of women, some uncertainty is on tap — particularly in the Senate, where the political landscape is shifting with the election of more left-leaning members.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's a lot of unknown in the sense that there are 44 new members in the House and 17 new members in the Senate, said Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr. (D-Calvert). We are waiting to hear some of the ideas they will be bringing forward. Some of them campaigned from the left; some campaigned from the right.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Michael E. Busch (D-Anne Arundel) said that despite Hogan's victory, Democrats had big wins in November and he expects the new members in the Democratic-\\n\\ncontrolled legislature to push for the minimum wage, criminal justice reform and improving the environment, including a mandate that half of Maryland's energy come from renewable sources such as solar and wind by 2030.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite a delay in final recommendations from the Kirwan Commission, an education panel created to overhaul the state's public schools and devise funding formulas to pay for it, Busch and Miller said education funding is at the top of the Democratic agenda.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe commission's preliminary recommendations include expanding early-childhood education, increasing teacher pay and boosting spending on special education.\\n\\nThe panel estimates the cost of those programs at $3.8 billion annually for the next 10 years. The battle over how the state and local governments will pay that tab is not expected until next year.\\n\\nDemocratic lawmakers are preparing to clash with Hogan over budget priorities, particularly his plan to use $1.9 billion from casino money for school construction over the next five years, instead of devoting all those funds toward the initiatives outlined by the Kirwan Commission.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBusch said the policy initiatives are just as important, if not more so, than the school construction.\\n\\nIt's nice to have a shiny new car sitting in the driveway, but if it doesn't have a motor in it, it's not going to leave the driveway, he said. You have to have the ability to attract the best and the brightest teachers. You have to have early-childhood development programs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMiller, who along with Busch was invited to the governor's mansion for breakfast last week to discuss bipartisanship, said the state is committed to help build and repair schools, but we don't need it to come from the casino money.\\n\\nMiller said Hogan, who announced the school construction funding last month during a news conference, has not discussed the proposal with him or Busch. Miller said during a recent interview that $400 million was mandated for school construction last year and that the General Assembly is prepared to agree to as much, if not more, this year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe money from MGM needs to go into the classrooms to elevate the status of teachers, to lower classroom size, to provide pre-K and to provide also for career readiness technology for those students who aren't on the path to college and need careers, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Paul G. Pinsky (D-Prince George's), the incoming chairman of the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee who also served on the Kirwan Commission, said the panel recommended that $125 million in casino money be spent on its recommendations.\\n\\nLawmakers could also clash with Hogan on proposals to increase the minimum wage from $10.10 an hour to $15 an hour, to penalize anyone who lacks health insurance, and to lower prescription drug prices. They may also be at odds on parole reform, and the question of whether to build a new stadium for the Washington Redskins.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere will also be a discussion about the University of Maryland Board of Regents and its role following the scandal surrounding the death of football player Jordan McNair.\\n\\nMiller, who is marking his 44th year in the General Assembly, sounded optimistic about the prospects for a $15 minimum wage in the state, a proposal pushed for years by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and one that left-leaning groups blamed Miller for blocking.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe're going to pass that, he said. It's just a question of how.\\n\\nHogan would not say whether he supports another hike in the minimum wage but said he doesn't want to do anything that could hurt the state's economy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm for making sure people can make as much money as they can and they can lift themselves from poverty, he said. I don't want to kill jobs or small businesses . . . I want to make sure we don't do something rapidly that's going to hurt the people it's supposed to help. We've got to take a look at that.\\n\\nHogan said during a recent interview that he does not support an individual mandate for health insurance, an issue that he says needs to be addressed at the federal level.\\n\\nIt's forcing people to do things against their will, he said. We're open to any kind of solution, but . . . I'm not in favor of penalizing people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBusch and Miller said they knew nothing about Hogan's plans to secure federal land for the Redskins to build a new stadium in Prince George's County. Hogan has said no tax money would be used to build the stadium. But the presiding officers said the stadium would need infrastructure, including sidewalks, sewer and roads. Busch opposes it, and Miller has questions about using land that is rich in history.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe legislature and the Hogan administration are working together on continued efforts at criminal justice reform. Del. Kathleen M. Dumais (D-Montgomery), who will serve as the House majority leader, said the legislature will begin laying the groundwork for changes to the state's juvenile justice system.\\n\\nHogan said recently that he also expects to find common ground with the Democratic-\\n\\ncontrolled legislature on whether Maryland will join a host of other states that have legalized sports betting. Busch wants the taxes from sports betting to be used to support the education commission recommendations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnother revenue generator that some lawmakers are eyeing: legalizing recreational marijuana for adults. But, similar to sports betting, Miller said legalizing marijuana would be a ballot initiative and would be taken up the year it would go on the ballot.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeveral pieces of legislation are aimed at stemming violence in Baltimore. Miller has suggested adding 500 new police officers and creating a police academy at Coppin State University. He also supports Johns Hopkins University's plan to create its own police department, an idea that sparked outrage from Sen.-elect Mary L. Washington (D-Baltimore City).\\n\\nWashington, who ousted a veteran Democrat in the primary, applauded Miller for working with the city but said she is strongly and unconditionally opposed to any proposal that would allow Johns Hopkins University to wholly own and operate a private police force."}

{"original": "Washington Post music critic Paul Hume knew what he liked. That did not include the singing of Margaret Truman. (Arthur Ellis /The Washington Post)\\n\\nOn July 15, 1969, Charles S. Murphy, a former administrative assistant and special counsel to President Harry S. Truman, sat down to give an oral history of his time in Truman's White House. Various matters of policy and politics were discussed, but the interviewer, Jerry N. Hess, couldn't resist asking about the famously irate note Truman sent in 1950 to Washington Post critic Paul Hume after Hume panned a concert by the president's daughter, Margaret.\\n\\nTruman was known for his sharp letters, but usually his White House staff intercepted them before they could be sent, Murphy said. In this case, however, Truman mailed the note himself before he could be talked out of it.\\n\\n[Remembering the time a president threatened to punch a Washington Post critic]\\n\\nLast week in this space, Answer Man explored this famous episode. There's plenty more to explore. To Answer Man, the most interesting part of Murphy's oral history is when he mentions that Truman was concerned that Margaret's manager was skimming money from her nationwide singing tour.\\n\\nTruman gave Murphy and another assistant, Donald Dawson, a special assignment. It was, Murphy said, to see that the receipts of the concert at DAR Constitution Hall were properly accounted for and Margaret got what she was supposed to get from it.\\n\\nEnraged by Hume's review of his daughter Margaret's recital, President Harry S. Truman dashed off this intemperate note. (Courtesy of Christie's New York)\\n\\nThe president's men decided to impound the ticket stubs that were collected at the door. Now, we never counted them, but nobody ever found out whether we counted them or not, Murphy said.\\n\\nThis strikes Answer Man as a bit unseemly. White House staff being inserted into a president's daughter's business dealings? Said Murphy: And later, we assured the President that, in our best judgment, that the matter was properly handled and that the receipts were all properly accounted for.\\n\\nSounds like Margaret's manager got the message.\\n\\nThere must have been some Americans who wondered whether Margaret's high-profile singing career was boosted by her father's job. The Post's Hume never said that, though after her appearance at a DAR Constitution Hall performance in 1949 with the NSO, he noted: At the rate of over $100 per minute, Miss Truman is one of the country's highest paid singers. She has a long way to go if she is to merit her reward.\\n\\nSeveral readers pointed out that Truman had a lot on his mind in December 1950, when he penned the letter threatening to punch Hume. The Chinese had entered the Korean War in late November. The very day of Margaret's concert, Truman's press secretary, Charlie Ross, had dropped dead at his desk.\\n\\nTruman was already under considerable strain when he saw Hume's review, wrote reader J.S. Sonies of Herndon, Va.\\n\\nThe District's Tom Bower said when he visited Key West, Fla., he toured the Truman Little White House, where the president sometimes vacationed.\\n\\nFor Margaret Truman, Hume was a tough audience. ( Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division)\\n\\nIn the living room there is a period radio that has been provided with a copy of the performance by Ms. Truman which is switched on by the docent as part of the discussion of the event, Tom wrote. It is a fine bit of living history for each attendee to determine the status of her voice.\\n\\nOf course, a recorded voice is different from a live, unamplified voice, a point Hume made in his review of Margaret's 1951 release American Songs. Backed by the Victor Orchestra and the Robert Shaw Chorale, Margaret sang the works of six early American composers.\\n\\nIn his review of the album, Hume opined, The music has a freshness and originality that makes the record a treat.\\n\\nA treat! Ah, but notice he wrote the music, not the singing. Hume said that the microphone had given Margaret's voice a resonant tone that it did not actually possess. He lamented that Miss Truman has, even on records, her usual troublesome habits. Though her voice was richer, there was still an insecurity of pitch, especially when compared with the supporting chorus of sopranos, none of whose names will probably ever be known to American audiences.\\n\\nWell, you can't say that Hume wasn't consistent in his writing about Margaret Truman.\\n\\nHume did seem able to dissociate his role as a critic from his role as a citizen, and to dissociate Truman's role as a president from Truman's role a protective father. In April 1951, the Associated Press transmitted a story headlined, Now Paul Hume Writes a Letter to the President.\\n\\nThe letter was in support of Truman's firing of Gen. Douglas MacArthur. Hume declined to quote from the missive and told the Associated Press: Honestly, there's no news in it. I just sat down and wrote the President a letter like hundreds of other folks do.\\n\\nTwitter: @johnkelly\\n\\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/johnkelly"}
{"original": "More than 14,450 acres of Maryland's forests have disappeared to development in the past eight years, and conservationists say that's the good news.\\n\\nBefore the recession dampened the building industry, about 7,000 acres of Maryland's tree canopy vanished every year.\\n\\nNow, as the economy rebounds, environmentalists are seeking a stronger state law to prevent further degradation of one of the best filters of Chesapeake Bay pollution — contiguous forests that once blanketed the state.\\n\\nWe're still losing forest land, and this bill is asking someone who cuts down an acre of forest to plant one, said state Sen. Ronald N. Young (D-Frederick), who sponsored the measure.\\n\\nYoung said the stricter rule — a fourfold increase from the 1991 Forest Conservation Act's original standards — is crucial to fulfilling the state's no net loss policy on forest coverage.\\n\\nThe proposal pits conservationists against the development community at time when Gov. Larry Hogan (R), a former real estate developer, has pushed other measures to strengthen his environmental record.\\n\\nWe're focused on our environmental package, and we'll see what other bills get to his desk, Hogan spokesman Doug Mayer said. He declined to offer a position on the forest legislation.\\n\\nDevelopers say the one-for-one proposal is impractical and would drive development to farmland, promoting sprawl. It would also shift the focus away from preserving the most ecologically valuable forest land, they said.\\n\\nReplanting acre for acre, there's not enough land in the state, really, to do that, said Lori Graf, chief executive of the Maryland Building Industry Association. We're not looking to cut down more trees than we have to.\\n\\nGraf said that in many cases, development can improve the drainage and ecology of a site and actually create a better environment.\\n\\nAn analysis of forestry records by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation found application of the existing forest law varies widely, with some Eastern Shore counties replanting less than 2 percent of the forested acres removed during development over the past eight years.\\n\\n[Chesapeake Bay Foundation spent extra to make headquarters eco-friendly]\\n\\nSome jurisdictions rely heavily on a provision that allows developers to pay a fee instead of replanting the trees. Legislative analysts said most fees don't cover the cost of replanting, and local governments often struggle to find ways to replant.\\n\\nApplication of the law has also led to lawsuits that tangle up developments in court. A pair of proposed developments of wooded property in Annapolis prompted such controversy that the city decided to rewrite its local policies on forest conservation.\\n\\nRob Savidge, an environmental scientist, quit his job with the Annapolis city government over the way the city interpreted the law. He's now pushing to strengthen the state law to avoid what he views as pitfalls that let developers negotiate out of replanting trees.\\n\\nThere's always going to be a net loss of forest under the way the law is written, he said. If we want to stop that, we're going to have to change it.\\n\\nLeaders in the development community strenuously objected to proposed changes to the state law, which include sharply escalating fees designed to deter companies from paying their way out planting trees.\\n\\nThey said the fees exceed the expense of replanting the trees and could drive the forestry cost of developing a 100-acre property from about $98,000 to as much as $400,000.\\n\\nTom Ballentine, vice president of public policy and government relations for the commercial real estate development association NAIOP, said the existing law was designed to promote retention of the most ecologically valuable forests.\\n\\nThe forest conservation act was never intended to be a no-net-loss tool, by itself, he said.\\n\\nSome jurisdictions have used it that way.\\n\\nCarroll County, which requires developers to plant an acre of forest for each cleared during development, has one of the best records in the state and gained 64 acres of forestland over the past eight years, according to the bay foundation's analysis.\\n\\nJonathan Bowman, Carroll's forest conservation manager, said the mostly rural district set a high bar decades ago and refused to set up a fee system if developers can't meet it. Instead, the county set up a forest bank where property owners can voluntarily reforest property, then sell the credits to developers who can't replant every acre they cut down.\\n\\nIt's an accepted part of the program, Bowman said. A lot of people don't want to pay a lot of money to replant trees, but if that's how they get their permits approved, they'll do it.\\n\\nSince 1995, 557 acres of banked forest land in Carroll has been sold to developers to offset their projects.\\n\\nSome state officials dispute that Maryland is losing any forest at all, citing other conservation efforts that increase forest land and more refined methods of counting how much of the state's roughly 6.2 million acres is covered in trees.\\n\\nThe Maryland Forest Service, relying on two methods, estimates at least 2.6 million acres remain forested — above the 40 percent tree canopy goal set in a 2013 law that mandated no net loss.\\n\\nAfter the state passed that law, it enacted two programs to increase forest land: a $25 coupon for homeowners who plant trees, and a now-defunct Lawn to Woodland program that planted trees on private properties four acres or smaller. That added about 200 acres of forest before it was discontinued, according the Department of Natural Resources.\\n\\nThe Maryland Municipal League and the Maryland Association of Counties, which represent local governments, also objected to the one-for-one proposal. Representatives for both organizations told the Senate Environment, Health and Education Committee last week that cities don't have enough undeveloped, unforested land to accommodate that.\\n\\nIf cities looked elsewhere for places to replant, other governments might object, said Candace L. Donoho, lobbyist for the municipal league.\\n\\nState Sen. Joan Carter Conway (D-Baltimore), a co-sponsor of the measure, said there's room for compromise and teamwork.\\n\\nWe just wouldn't run up to Frederick and say, 'Hi, here are all of Baltimore's trees,'  the committee chairwoman said.\\n\\nThe development pressure on Maryland's forest land is likely to increase in the future, said economist Anirban Basu, chairman and chief executive of Sage Policy Group.\\n\\nBasu said deforestation slowed as developers focused on office, hotel and apartment development in urban areas to accommodate demand from millennials attached to city life.\\n\\nBut as those 20-something millennials get married and start families, Basu said, it could enhance demand for the suburban development that cuts into forests."}
{"original": "A number of urgent tasks require Biden's attention, but we'll focus on the economic landscape and the federal response to the Covid-19 pandemic, as we have in a series of previous columns over the past year. These are massive challenges in and of themselves, so how should Biden approach them?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn his campaign, Biden highlighted an array of economic policies he promised to embrace, including a much-needed and long overdue tax hike on the wealthiest Americans. Biden's administration should be able to significantly roll back the massive tax cuts that President Donald Trump and his allies engineered and, in so doing, help address the searing economic injustices that have accompanied rampant wealth and income inequality in the U.S.\\n\\nBiden has also advocated expanding access to Medicaid and affordable health care, beefing up unemployment insurance and creating a national jobs corps. He wants to offer more federal support to entrepreneurs, promote clean energy, rebuild the nation's infrastructure and enhance the economic relief measures that were initiated with the CARES Act last spring and extended modestly since then.\\n\\nAll of this is being considered amid a pandemic that has exposed Trump's White House as inept and dangerously disengaged, tested the wherewithal of state and local leadership, and strained the resolve of average Americans. But Covid-19 also affords Biden an opportunity to demonstrate how the federal government can promote economic progress and healing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAn effective Covid-19 relief package can't be an exotic Band-Aid. It needs to do more than support the economy for weeks or months. It should help lay the foundations for profitable and productive companies and a more prosperous workforce. This will require considerable investment in high-quality education, infrastructure and public health, and a more expansive safety net for vulnerable Americans.\\n\\nIf Biden is serious about creating a national jobs corps, then the federal government should hire every unemployed American at a living wage of, say, $58,000 a year. This would cost roughly $1.1 trillion annually — far more than either political party has offered — but it's an amount that the government could absorb and manage. It also would greatly reduce the inefficiencies, squabbles and fraud surrounding the various unemployment and income-assistance programs that have been doled out over the past several months.\\n\\nBiden should also reposition the Department of Homeland Security to help address government weaknesses that Covid-19 has exposed. Biden could empower DHS to coordinate the initiatives of several federal agencies — including the departments of Treasury, Transportation, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education — to bolster preparedness in public health, workplace safety, infrastructure and other key areas. DHS could also coordinate federal investments to create a national network of public hospitals and medical clinics, enhance public transportation, and provide digital access in low-income urban and rural areas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInvestment in infrastructure, in particular, would be a huge boon to the U.S. economy. It's no secret that the country's roads, bridges and public transportation are crumbling, so that's an obvious place to start. But stopping there would be a mistake. Infrastructure plays a crucial role in two of the country's biggest challenges: winning the fight against climate change and delivering economic prosperity to all Americans.\\n\\nAny serious attempt to tackle climate change will require a meaningful reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions, roughly a third of which is generated by transportation. As early as 2016, research showed that most gas-guzzlers could be replaced with low-cost electric cars available at the time, which would significantly reduce emissions, even accounting for greater consumption of electricity. The Biden administration can promote and expedite electric-car adoption by building a network of charging stations alongside existing gas stations, eventually replacing them altogether.\\n\\nBut perhaps the most important infrastructure investment resides in the digital realm. Covid-19 has accelerated a trend that has been underway for years: moving work, schooling, shopping and entertainment online. All this requires fast, reliable and affordable broadband service, which is in short supply outside of homes and offices.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat's a problem for an economy heavily dependent on the internet. But it can be solved by building a national broadband system akin to the national highway system that the federal government created in the 1950s. The new highways allowed labor, goods and people to move more cheaply and easily around the country, paving the way for business expansion, investment and job creation that benefited companies, workers and the broader economy.\\n\\nA national system of free and reliable broadband would have widespread benefits. It would enable businesses to reach more consumers, educational resources to reach more Americans, and employers to reach a greater pool of workers — boosting the economy and making the U.S. more competitive. It's hard to imagine a more worthwhile investment of taxpayer dollars.\\n\\nBiden's economic policy priorities should be aimed at three fundamental goals: ensuring that all Americans maintain an adequate standard of living until the Covid-19 crisis ends; backstopping essential public and private services; and equipping the economy and workers to be productive, innovative and competitive through the end of the century.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Biden builds a legislative coalition on Capitol Hill to support his agenda, he must also sell it to the American public. This is where the president-elect's decades of public service and his understanding of the federal machinery will come into play.

{"original": "Cuomo, widely seen as a potential contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, said the provision is violative of states' rights and the principle of equal protection.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWashington has launched an all-out, direct attack on New York State's economic future, Cuomo said at his State of the State address in Albany. It is crass. It is ugly. It is divisive. It is partisan legislating. It is an economic civil war. Make no mistake: They are aiming to hurt us.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe new GOP law caps how much taxpayers can deduct in state and local taxes at $10,000; previously, the deduction was unlimited. As a result, New York residents could pay an additional $14 billion in federal taxes, Cuomo said, and taxpayers in California, New Jersey and Illinois are also expected to pay more under the change. Gov. Phil Murphy (D-N.J.) told CNBC last month that everything is on the table in terms of combating the GOP law, including challenging its legality and constitutionality in court.\\n\\nBut constitutional law professors express doubt that the federal courts will seriously entertain striking down the GOP's cap on the deduction. They noted that Republicans had articulated justifications for ending the state and local deduction beyond a simple attempt to punish liberal voters, and argued that a successful lawsuit may in fact wind up harming progressive policy priorities in the long run.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe overall incoherence of the bill is real, so I'm sympathetic to New York's claims, said professor Darien Shanske of the University of California Davis School of Law. But there are non-crazy arguments for getting rid of the deduction — there's a rational reason to get rid of it, even if it's one you disagree with.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCuomo's administration, working with state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, is exploring a number of legal challenges. They could include arguments that the GOP plan violates the 10th and 14th amendments to the Constitution.\\n\\nNew York State is exploring a variety of legal claims in response to the divisive federal SALT law, the state's chief counsel, Alphonso David, said in a statement. The practical and intended impact of this law is to impose a disadvantage on 'blue' states. Courts have historically rejected government action that inappropriately targets a class of people and this should be no different.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCongress would have violated the 14th Amendment had Republicans passed a tax bill that, for example, specified that taxes be raised on Democratic voters and lowered on Republican voters. But the bill's defenders, and even some of its critics, say that there are nonpartisan justifications for capping the deduction. Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), for instance, argued throughout that the tax debate that eliminating or paring back the deduction would force blue states to lower their local taxes — not that doing so would help make lives miserable for coastal elites.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe federal government is eliminating what had been an unfair benefit. The U.S. Constitution does not require that high-tax states can give themselves a large federal tax cut, which is essentially what SALT does, said Brian Riedl, senior fellow at the libertarian-leaning Manhattan Institute, who added of the Cuomo lawsuit: It's completely frivolous and there's no basis for it.\\n\\nCuomo's other likely argument, that the GOP tax law violates the 10th Amendment's guarantee of state sovereignty, may also not stand up in court, according to Shanske. The 16th Amendment gives Congress the authority to institute a federal income tax, and the federal government has the authority to determine which deductions can be claimed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think that's also a loser, Shanske said of the 10th Amendment claim.\\n\\nMichael Dorf, a constitutional law professor at Cornell Law School, has argued the provision could be struck down if it could be shown to have been designed to punish Democrats, perhaps under the First Amendment. But Dorf also acknowledged that the climb to a successful legal challenge to the new law appears steep."}
{"original": "The senator leaned in closer, sharing a sheet of paper with the oversized extern seated next to him. Listed was the day's schedule, groups coming through the office, committee hearings on tap and policy matters that needed to be explored.\\n\\nThe ones that are highlighted in blue are ones where I'll be making the full meeting, Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) explained. Will Pericak, a 300-pound offensive lineman for the Seattle Seahawks, nodded.\\n\\nOutside the office, official Washington was consumed Thursday morning with reports that the attorney general might have met with a Russian ambassador. For at least a moment, though, Gardner's office was much more focused on the staid details of the day.\\n\\nIf you follow all the media, you'd think they're throwing grenades and launching rocks from windows out here, Pericak said, like everybody's at each other's throats. But really, there's nice people who are working their tails off to make things better.\\n\\nPericak, 27, is one of three NFL players who have been working on Capitol Hill as part of a crash-course three-week externship program run by the NFL Players Association. The union encourages players to spend part of their offseason exploring other career fields, and last month, 41 NFL players were planted with 15 different organizations. While Pericak, Titans lineman Karim Barton and free agent defensive back Dion Bailey are working with elected members of Congress, others are assigned to businesses such as Marriott, Under Armour and Comcast SportsNet.\\n\\nWill Pericak walks with Senator Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) to a hearing on Capitol Hill. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe trio of football players on the Hill arrived at a particularly unique time in Washington: shortly after President Trump's inauguration, as the Senate held confirmation hearings for appointees and the House opened a new session. There is turnover and change every two years, but the frenetic pace and the political bombast and drama have been turned up several notches.\\n\\nBailey said that when he came to the Hill, he expected it to be very uptight. But it was reassuring, he said, to arrive at his temporary assignment each morning, sit behind a desk and get away from 24-hour news networks and the morning headlines.\\n\\nIt's been refreshing to actually know that all of politics isn't the stuff you see on CNN and what Trump's doing every second, he said. It's refreshing to understand that there's more going on, bigger problems and things that need to be addressed.\\n\\nWhile a new crop of football prospects have gathered in Indianapolis this week for the NFL Scouting Combine with hopes of long and lucrative playing careers, the game's veterans know it is never too early to think about life beyond football. From Day 1, everybody tells you that football won't be your last job, said Pericak, who earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Colorado in finance as well as a masters in accounting.\\n\\nPericak spent Thursday, his second-to-last day in Gardner's office, shadowing the senator. After the morning briefing, they walked together to a subcommitte e hearing.\\n\\nYou enjoying everything so far? Gardner asked as the two waited for an elevator.\\n\\nOh yeah. You have a great staff. It's interesting how similar some things are. You're kind of like Pete Carroll, Pericak said, referring to the Seahawks' head coach. He sets the tone, and everybody kind of falls in line.\\n\\nThe externs quickly learned that on the Hill, big moments are usually preceded by a million less glamorous ones. In Washington, that means constituent calls and emails. The three also have been assigned to help research some policy issues and gather background for their temporary bosses. Pericak researched foreign policy. Bailey read up on agriculture and food.\\n\\nI hope Dion learns from his time in Washington, takes what he has learned back to his community and looks at public service as a viable option in the future, his boss, Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), said.\\n\\nBarton, for his part, is participating in the NFLPA externship program for the third straight offseason. Last year, he was a marketing extern for a Texas mattress company, and before that, he worked with a sports-merchandise company. This year he has been in the office of Rep. Yvette D. Clarke (D-N.Y.).\\n\\nThe information, man, so much information is circulating on a daily basis, Barton said. You wouldn't believe how much paper you see every day. I mean, wow.\\n\\nFor many football players, there's little time to think about a Plan B. Since they were young, they spent afternoons and summers on football fields or in weight rooms — not working jobs, not applying for internships or anything else that might work on a résumé. When football is no longer an option, many are left with no practical work experience, limited contacts and often no clue about what other fields might be worth pursuing.\\n\\nI don't know what that thing outside of football will be, what will make me excited to get up in the morning every day to perform, Barton said. But that's okay. That's why I've been doing this: to find out what else gives me that burning desire.\\n\\nOn Thursday morning, Gardner and Pericak walked briskly through the halls from the Russell to the Dirksen building, where the subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet was holding a hearing on wireless technology.\\n\\nGardner also serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, which is probably why a reporter caught him in the hallway to ask about the controversy surrounding the attorney general. Any thoughts about him recusing himself? she asked.\\n\\nPericak's eyes were wide as he quietly observed the scene. Gardner kept smiling at the impromptu pressing. Look, let's see the information first, he said, quickly excusing himself.\\n\\nGardner and the lineman disappeared into the committee hearing room, where Pericak sat behind the senator. As they heard testimony, Gardner occasionally leaned back, whispering to his extern or sharing notes. At one point, Gardner unearthed an old photo on his phone of himself as a young boy, meeting John Elway. Pericak and Gardner shared a laugh at the 1980s clothing and the senator's brush with football greatness.\\n\\nThe externship program ends Friday. The players will return to their homes and resume their offseason training. They're excited about next season, but each will return to the football field with an eye cast much further down the road.\\n\\nI'm really trying to plant seeds that will help over time, Bailey said, so when the time comes when I have to hang up the cleats, I've already invested in my future."}
{"original": "It's rush hour on a November evening in Washington's busiest regional rail hub, but swarming commuters must yield to a much more potent tide. The Federalist Society has taken over the Main Hall of Union Station for its annual black-tie gala. The stone walls of the vast, vaulted concourse are bathed in pale red and blue, while larger-than-life white spotlight cameo silhouettes of James Madison's head — the society's trademark — crown the columns and glow on video screens. Two hundred and twenty sold-out tables, each set for 10, await the throng funneling through a block-long tent, where $200-a-plate tickets are checked; inside, exclamations of celebration and reunion echo and blend into a deafening roar.\\n\\nListen to this and other great stories from The Washington Post Magazine on the Curio app.\\n\\nEven when the crowd simmers down, it's so hard to hear in the cavernous hall that the words of retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah — who is receiving an award — are mostly lost to history. Whatever he's saying, I'm sure it's good, says Lew Olowski, who, like me, has crept closer to try to hear. He was a human rights activist studying at Georgetown Law a decade ago when, he tells me, joining the Federalist Society expanded his mind to see both sides of issues. Now he's general counsel for an organization helping poor pregnant women get a leg up and, not incidentally, keep their babies. His ears prick up at isolated morsels of Hatch's talk: … religious freedom … administrative state. … See what I mean? Olowski says. Music to my ears.\\n\\n(Illustrations by Sam Spratt for The Washington Post)\\n\\nThere is much for this crowd to celebrate. The conservative and libertarian society for law and public policy studies has reached an unprecedented peak of power and influence. Brett Kavanaugh, whose membership in the society dates to his Yale Law School days, has just been elevated to the Supreme Court; he is the second of President Trump's appointees, following Neil Gorsuch, another justice closely associated with the society. They join Justice Clarence Thomas (who said last spring he's been a part of the Federalist Society now since meeting with them … in the 1980s), Chief Justice John Roberts (listed as a member in 1997-98) and Justice Samuel Alito (a periodic speaker at society events). The newly solidified conservative majority on the court will inevitably decide more cases in line with the society's ideals — which include checking federal power, protecting individual liberty and interpreting the Constitution according to its original meaning. In practice, this could mean fewer regulations of the environment and health care, more businesses allowed to refuse service to customers on religious grounds, and denial of protections claimed by newly vocal classes of minorities, such as transgender people.\\n\\nThis illustration is based on Howard Chandler Christy's 1940 painting, Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States, with contemporary players on both sides of the judicial contest. 1. Stephen Breyer, 2. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 3. Sonia Sotomayor, 4. Elena Kagan, 5. Chuck Schumer, 6. Kamala Harris, 7. Leonard Leo, 8. Vice President Pence, 9. Orrin Hatch, 10. Chuck Grassley, 11. John Roberts, 12. Susan Collins, 13. Lindsey Graham, 14. Mitch McConnell, 15. President Trump, 16. Samuel Alito, 17. Neil Gorsuch, 18. Clarence Thomas and 19. Brett Kavanaugh.\\n\\nBut having allies on the highest court of the land is just the top layer of the Federalist Society's expanding sway. For one thing, there is the judicial nomination process itself. When Trump was campaigning in 2016, he made the shrewd and un­or­tho­dox move of publicizing a list of 11 conservative legal stars that he promised to draw from if he got a chance to pick a Supreme Court justice. Leonard Leo, executive vice president of the Federalist Society, played a key role in suggesting the names, along with Trump's future White House counsel, Don McGahn (also a society member), and the conservative Heritage Foundation. The list was expanded twice to include Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and others. Leo took a leave from his job at the Federalist Society to advise the White House on the confirmation process for Gorsuch and Kavanaugh — reprising a role he played for the George W. Bush White House in putting Roberts and Alito on the court.\\n\\nThe next most important segment of the judiciary — the federal appeals courts — is also filling up with Federalist Society members: Twenty-five of the 30 appeals court judges Trump has appointed are or were members of the society. Our opponents of judicial nominees frequently claim the president has outsourced his selection of judges, McGahn quipped to a Federalist Society gathering in 2017. That is completely false. I've been a member of the Federalist Society since law school. Still am. So, frankly, it seems like it's been in-sourced.\\n\\nKavanaugh, Gorsuch, Alito and Thomas are all at the banquet — a record turnout of Supreme Court justices for the annual affair. There's also a trio of Trump's once and future Justice Department leaders: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (alumnus of the Federalist Society's Harvard Law School chapter), recently fired attorney general Jeff Sessions (frequent society speaker) and acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker (recommended by Leonard Leo to be Sessions's chief of staff). It's as if the players in the recent melodramas surrounding the Justice Department are minor actors compared with the Federalist Society itself — which provides the enduring climate within which storms on the right come and go.\\n\\nTo close the gala, McGahn and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell settle in armchairs below the giant Madison heads for an onstage tete-a-tete, during which they all but spike the football over the current pace of appointing conservatives to all levels of the federal judiciary — the judges project, as McConnell calls it. At the appeals court level, in particular, Trump has made more appointments than all other presidents at the same point in their presidencies, according to research by Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution. (At the district court level, however, Trump's pace lags behind that of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.) My goal … is to do everything we can for as long as we can to transform the federal judiciary, because everything else we do is transitory, McConnell says. The closest thing we will ever have an opportunity to do to have the longest impact on the country is confirming these great men and women and transforming the judiciary for as long into the future as we can. McConnell notes that the judges list played a big part in getting Trump elected. The majority leader looks out over the gathering almost mistily as he concludes: I hope you are proud of what we've done.\\n\\nAs pumped as anyone is Olowski, watching with me from the side. But to understand what the Federalist Society has achieved and where it's headed, he advises me to look beyond the scorecard of confirmed judges — and to instead consider the intellectual sparring and professional grooming going on at Federalist Society chapters and forums across the land.\\n\\nThis advice resonates with what I had been picking up over a couple of weeks of conversations with people in and around the organization: Much of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level. And so, a glimpse of the impact yet to come could be had at far tables fanning out to the corners of Union Station where the sound is bad — the law students and professors from Houston, Boston and Los Angeles; the young lawyers at the dawn of long careers scarfing fancy food at tables underwritten by their firms. Let the politicians build the coalitions to confirm conservative judges and roll back the administrative state, Olowski says. That's not the Federalist Society's job. The Federalist Society's job is to put these ideas out there. And of course, as James Madison could tell us, ideas tend to outlive presidents, political majorities and even judges.\\n\\nWorking with President Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the goal is to transform the federal judiciary.\\n\\nThe original ambition was not so grand. A handful of conservative law students at the University of Chicago, Yale and Harvard in the early 1980s wanted an outlet for their maverick notions of the law amid the liberal domination of the legal academy. When we started the Federalist Society, we didn't know we were starting the Federalist Society, Lee Liberman Otis, one of the Chicago co-founders, told me. We thought we were starting groups at each of our law schools. … 'Let's start something where we could talk about those ideas.' \\n\\nThe students announced a national symposium to be held at Yale in the spring of 1982. Word spread ahead of the conference, and so many letters came from students at other schools asking how to start a chapter that Otis says she and another co-founder quickly drafted a guide. Daniel Kelly was a senior at the College of the Holy Cross and applying to law school when he heard about it. Thrilled at the prospect, he and some friends drove 100 miles from Worcester, Mass., to New Haven, Conn., and slept on the floor of a friend's Yale dorm. They were saying something that seemed completely plain sense and true to us, Kelly recalls, which is when you look at the Constitution, you should look at the way the framers wrote it and interpret it as best you can based upon the intention of the framers. Kelly is now head of the Federalist Society lawyers chapter in Boston, where, in late October, Sessions gave one of his last speeches as attorney general.\\n\\nSpeakers at that first symposium included future justice Antonin Scalia, who was then a law professor at the University of Chicago and a mentor to the campus Federalist Society chapter. Choosing as his topic The Two Faces of Federalism, Scalia presumed that his audience was on a mission to influence national policy, and so he told the gathering: I urge you, then — as Hamilton would have urged you — to keep in mind that the federal government is not bad but good. The trick is to use it wisely.\\n\\nMuch of the Federalist Society's influence comes not from its very public Washington victories but from its behind-the-scenes, grass-roots ability to shift the law at the idea level, even the cultural level.\\n\\nAnother speaker was future solicitor general Ted Olson, who was then an assistant attorney general in the office of legal counsel. I didn't have any idea how far it would go or what it would become, Olson told me, but I did feel at the time … this is something interesting happening here. In his address to that first symposium, he said: I sense that we are at one of those points in history where the pendulum may be beginning to swing in another direction. Of course, we do not know now, and no one will really know until many years from now, whether the 1980 elections have wrought a significant and long-lasting change. But I think that there is an opportunity here; and the organization of this society and this symposium is a cause for optimism and a sign that perhaps something is happening.\\n\\nFrom there, the story of the Federalist Society's influence became the story of approximately 70,000 random epiphanies. That's roughly the number of active participants in the society today, according to its leadership. My admittedly unscientific sample of a dozen Federalists' personal stories — backed up by political scientists' more systematic research into the question — suggests that each individual Federalist is akin to an excited synapse in a sprawling hive mind with no one actually in charge.\\n\\nI have a very distinctive beginning story, Randy Barnett told me over eggs at a diner in Logan Circle a few days before the society's annual national convention in November. There was no Federalist Society when I was a law student, so I didn't know anything about it. I heard about it, and my impression of it was it was going to be a very right-wing organization, and I'm a libertarian — I'm not a conservative.\\n\\nToday, Barnett is a professor of constitutional law at Georgetown and an influential voice in the legal wars over the Affordable Care Act, medical marijuana and the like. But his first encounter with the Federalist Society came in 1986, two academic postings ago, when he was a relatively junior professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law. A student invited him to speak on a panel at one of the early Federalist Society national student symposiums. Barnett was reluctant because he thought his perspective would be unwelcome, and anyway, he taught contracts, not the Constitution. But he was ambitious enough to want to rub shoulders with the legal celebrities who would also be invited. So he said yes.\\n\\nHe was on a panel about freedom of association. Most people consider it a hallowed right — yet it is one that is not mentioned in the Constitution. Some legal theorists fret over assorted rights being smuggled into the Constitution by activist judges. On the panel, Barnett knew he was seated beside a conservative advocate of judicial restraint. And so, Barnett told me, I said at the end of my little talk, 'I know what you're thinking: What gives lifetime-appointed judges the power to protect a right that isn't actually mentioned in the text of the Constitution?'  He recalled that he paused dramatically. And then, as I had prepared, my next thing was to read the text of the Ninth Amendment, which says the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. And when I said that, this huge roar [of approval] came up from the audience.\\n\\nBarnett realized he had misread the Federalist Society. Despite his initial impression of a closed conservative sect, the society seemed open to testing a diversity of ideas — and speaking on that panel changed his professional life. He switched from contracts to constitutional law. He made himself an expert on the Ninth Amendment, which got him involved in a case seeking to protect people from federal prosecution for using medical marijuana in California, where the state had legalized it. The case ended up relying not on the Ninth Amendment, but on the commerce clause — a strict reading of which is a favorite Federalist tool for curbing federal power. Barnett argued the matter before the Supreme Court in 2004. He lost — but in the process he developed some subtle jujitsu moves with the commerce clause.\\n\\nFederal appeals court appointments President Trump has appointed more judges to the federal appeals courts than all other presidents at equivalent points in their presidencies.\\n\\n\\n\\n30 Donald J. Trump\\n\\n12 Barack Obama\\n\\n16 George W. Bush\\n\\n19 Bill Clinton\\n\\n22 George H.W. Bush\\n\\n19 Ronald Reagan\\n\\n\\n\\nFigures provided by Russell Wheeler, visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\\n\\nAnd that is how he had an arsenal of commerce-based arguments ready when the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. By then Barnett was a leading voice of the growing libertarian wing of the Federalist Society, and he became one of the architects of constitutional claims at the core of lawsuits against the health-care plan. His participation in the legal assault on Obamacare was hatched at — where else? — the Federalist Society's national convention in the fall of 2009, where, in the hallway of the Mayflower Hotel between sessions, he happened to bump into a clutch of fellow Federalists discussing the health-care legislation. (Josh Blackman, a popular Federalist social media force and a professor at the South Texas College of Law, documented the moment in his 2013 book, Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare.) Barnett told me how one person in the group says, 'You want to do something about this?' I said, 'Sure.' … And he said, 'Whatever we do, we've got to do it fast because it's going to come out of committee very soon.' \\n\\nA few weeks later, Barnett and co-authors Nathaniel Stewart and Todd Gaziano issued a 16-page legal memorandum via the Heritage Foundation that outlined a constitutional case against the health-care measure. According to Blackman, the paper became a source of talking points during congressional debate and laid the framework for subsequent court challenges; Barnett represented one of the plaintiffs.\\n\\nUltimately, of course, to the distress of most Federalists, the Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012. Yet to Barnett and others, it was still a victory for future deployments of the commerce clause argument against federal overreach, because a majority of the court agreed with the commerce-based critique. Instead, in his opinion upholding the measure, Chief Justice Roberts found other grounds to support the law.\\n\\nThis is how the Federalist Society influences things, Barnett told me. It's not the dark-money cabal. … By having free and fair discussion, it involves people, gets them interested, and they oftentimes will do something about that.\\n\\nSurfacing judicial candidates to be appointed when conservatives are in power is just one byproduct of the society's work — and maybe not the most important one.\\n\\nBarnett's experience is a typical example of how different the society is from the stereotype of a traditional top-down Washington pressure group. The society itself lobbies for no policies; it never signs amicus briefs or represents clients in cases. No one at Federalist Society headquarters in Washington dictated Barnett's moves or told him how to advocate for what positions. It's just that at a few gatherings made possible by the Federalist Society that Barnett happened to attend, synapses fired, a corner of the hive mind engaged, and Barnett took it from there. Multiply that chemistry tens of thousands of times over the past 36 years and you have the Federalist Society's true source of power.\\n\\nIt's a remarkably successful example of what political scientists call a political epistemic community — an interconnected network of experts with policy-relevant knowledge who share certain beliefs and work to actively transmit and translate those beliefs into policy, as Amanda Hollis-Brusky argued in her 2015 book, Ideas With Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution. Hollis-Brusky documented the impact of such a community: Focusing on key recent Supreme Court decisions on hot-button issues such as campaign finance, gun control and state sovereignty, she found that as many as two dozen people with Federalist Society connections played some role in crafting the arguments, arguing the cases, clerking for the judges or issuing the rulings.\\n\\nThat community now includes more than 200 student chapters at law schools, where Federalists are a minority presence, but a significant one. The Georgetown chapter has more than 100 members out of about 2,000 in the law school. The Federalist Society is one of our most active student organizations, law school Dean of Students Mitch Bailin told the society's national student symposium on campus in March. Of particular impact and importance to me, they regularly, happily, engagedly partner with our student organizations across the viewpoint spectrum to ensure the widest range of ideas are explored on the issues of the most urgent consequence.\\n\\nFederal district court appointments Despite President Trump's record pace of appeals court appointments, at the federal district court level he lags behind some recent presidents at the same point in their administrations.\\n\\n\\n\\n53 Donald J. Trump\\n\\n39 Barack Obama\\n\\n83 George W. Bush\\n\\n107 Bill Clinton\\n\\n48 George H.W. Bush\\n\\n67 Ronald Reagan\\n\\n\\n\\nFigures provided by Russell Wheeler, visiting fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.\\n\\nOnce students graduate, they can pick from more than 90 lawyers chapters around the country. Kaytlin Roholt graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 2014, clerked for two federal judges, served as a special counsel to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley during the Gorsuch nomination, and now practices at Jones Day and is a member of the steering committee of the Federalist Society's D.C. chapter for young lawyers. Regardless of where I am, I know that a Federalist Society event is a place where I can go to sort of stay current in the legal issues, to continue learning while practicing, she told me. What we really try to do on the young lawyers chapter is create spaces for people to engage with these issues that they wouldn't really be able to do during their day-to-day life as a lawyer. Panel organizers try to include advocates of liberal perspectives so ideas get a good workout. Together, the student and lawyers chapters put on about 1,500 programs a year.\\n\\nMany individual Federalists are political and ideological warriors, though never in the name of the Federalist Society. Rather, society events provide the proving ground where they hone their arguments, seize a chance to shine and come to the attention of mentors higher up in the political-legal hierarchy. In that sense, the Federalist Society is a talent network and placement agency as well.\\n\\nWhile the Federalist Society may never take an official position on anything, conservative funders know who their friends are. Ever since the founding symposium at Yale in 1982 was bankrolled largely by conservative organizations, the society has enjoyed steady financial support from the right. The group raised $20 million in 2017; more than $300,000 came from interests related to conservative activist funders Charles and David Koch.\\n\\nMost of the money went toward supporting the chapter programs and staging conferences — in other words, tending to the network and the idea factory. What makes Leonard Leo so consequential is not because he's so smart or whatever, it's that he's sitting at the center of an enormous network, says Steven Teles, author of The Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement: The Battle for Control of the Law and a professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University. He has lots of information, and that information isn't just his; it's that those things bubble up through those relationships … spreading through all these people who know each other, and they develop reputations and linkages, which then have lots of other consequences.\\n\\nSurfacing promising judicial candidates who can be nominated when conservatives have electoral power is just one byproduct of the network, and on its own maybe not the most important one, Teles explains. There's a supply-and-demand relationship between the judges and the network. The judges need scholarship and arguments extending Federalist principles into new areas. Where new legal theories depart from the status quo, they need them to be vetted and legitimized through public debate. They require targeted cases raising questions that provide an opening to move the law. Without professors and lawyers in the network filling that demand, Teles says, you're not going to maximize what you got through the electoral process.\\n\\nI met Leo at the Federalist Society's offices in Washington. Despite the fact that in his personal capacity while on leave from the society he put so much effort into advising the Trump administration on judges, he endorses the network theory of the society, telling me, It's less about who gets what job and more about building a community that can be self-perpetuating and self-sustaining and self-driving.\\n\\nThe Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, having helped create a list of Supreme Court candidates, is one of Trump's judge whisperers.\\n\\nLiberal legal advocates and scholars realized they were in a serious battle for the law with the Federalist Society after the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore in 2000, handing the White House to George W. Bush. Peter Rubin, then a professor at Georgetown, founded the American Constitution Society to win hearts and minds of students, lawyers and judges.\\n\\nPeter, among others, saw Bush v. Gore and recognized that we'd been snookered, Caroline Fredrickson, president of the ACS, told me. The left had been sleeping on its laurels, still living in the Warren Court and all of the sudden we were going to have the Roberts Court. And so the idea was to found an organization that would help organize progressive lawyers to protect the core fundamental values that we see in the Constitution.\\n\\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and a measure of how much the Federalist Society had already shifted frames of reference was the liberal response. ACS was very explicitly founded to do the same kind of work that the Federalist Society has done, Fredrickson says. We, too, have chapters across the country. … We also organize events. We have a group of scholars and experts who work with us on efforts to explain the Constitution and our laws to the broader public. But the ACS still lacks the reach of the Federalist Society, as measured in chapters and budgets. Fredrickson attributes the gap to legal institutions and opportunities on the left being more diffuse than on the right. Also: They do get a lot more corporate support than we do because it's in the interest of the corporations, she says. They want to get rid of regulations.\\n\\nThe traditional liberal response to the Federalist Society has included pointing out how suspiciously convenient it is that the jurisprudence advocated by society members so often yields conservative results. The conservatives reverse-engineered their preferred methodologies of interpreting the Constitution and legal statutes to reach the ends they want, goes this line of attack. Those methodologies are known as originalism and textualism because they are said to be founded in a search for the original meaning of the Constitution and the literal texts of legal statutes.\\n\\nBut more recently another liberal position has emerged, and it shows what the Federalists have achieved. This position might be summed up as: If you can't beat them, join them — methodologically, at least. A number of liberal scholars have applied themselves to the task of showing how, in fact, originalist approaches can yield progressive results. As this train of thought has flowed out of the academy, liberal originalist logic is, more and more, showing up in legal briefs and even in Supreme Court dissents. Advocates of all stripes know they must be ready with textualist arguments because, thanks in large part to the work of the Federalists, it's more likely than ever that the judge deciding a case will want to hear that perspective.\\n\\nFor too long progressives were ceding that constitutional ground to the right and organizations like the Federalist Society, says Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive think tank and law firm that fashions originalist arguments. When you actually look at the text and history of the entire Constitution, particularly focusing on the transformative amendments that were enacted in the wake of the Civil War, you really see an arc of progress that pushes our country toward inclusion, equality and greater democracy that tells a very different story from a lot of what the folks on the right, including the Federalist Society, would have you believe about our Constitution. The CAC has made originalist arguments in favor of same-sex marriage, affirmative action and abortion rights. Its position is that those rights are guaranteed by a textual and historical understanding of the original meaning of the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause. The CAC also is using an originalist reading of the foreign emoluments clause as it represents members of Congress who claim Trump is unconstitutionally benefiting from foreign payments.\\n\\nEven Federalists come down on both sides of some of these questions. In 2013, years after he spoke at the founding Federalist Society symposium, and after he won Bush v. Gore, Ted Olson returned to the Supreme Court to overturn a California proposition banning same-sex marriage. For their part, many liberal scholars and lawyers continue to reject originalism in favor of a vision of the Constitution flexible enough to embrace changing times and evolving notions of human rights. Still, even critics of originalism are forced to acknowledge the new reality: Despite recent work demonstrating the bankruptcy of these [originalist] approaches, liberal lawyers trying to get progressive results at the Supreme Court have already begun trying to pick off conservative justices through a calculated embrace of the theories, Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine, wrote recently in Slate.\\n\\nLeonard Leo told me he disputes the notion that the Constitution contains either conservative or progressive values, and he denies that originalism is rigged to reach conservative and libertarian results. The Constitution is a structural road map for how to ensure accountability and transparency in government, he said. And there are timeless values in it that are tied to the weaknesses of human nature and the danger of unlimited authority being vested in one person or a group of people. … You're practicing originalism appropriately when you're doing so without looking behind the curtain and trying to predetermine results.\\n\\nBut he welcomes liberals to the Federalist Society's jurisprudential worldview: There are liberals who work really hard at trying to develop a neutral, originalist approach to interpretation, he said. The fact that people may come out differently occasionally — that's okay. Half the battle is just agreeing that it is essential.\\n\\nTrump's Supreme Court appointees, Neil Gorsuch, left, and Brett Kavanaugh, both have Federalist Society connections.\\n\\nBack at the black-tie gala in Union Station — as McGahn and McConnell conclude what can only be described as a sedentary victory dance; as the four Federalist-friendly justices disperse into the night; as deputy AG Rosenstein and acting AG Whitaker linger for pictures with groups of giddy fans — I ponder: What now? Having reached this summit, what's left for the Federalist Society to conquer?\\n\\nI found some clues during the three days of the national convention at the Mayflower Hotel that bookended the gala. The judges project is still clearly in high gear, and with two sitting Supreme Court justices in their 80s — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 85, and Stephen Breyer, 80 — there's an incentive to keep the list of candidates fresh. Numerous candidates-in-waiting were on display at the conference. I counted 24 appeals court judges on the program — including 15 just elevated by Trump — and at least 11 of the names on Trump's expanded list of potential Supreme Court nominees were scheduled to participate over the three days.\\n\\nSome of the judges were treated as rock stars, especially Amy Coney Barrett, named by Trump to the 7th Circuit. More than one convention speaker got a rise out of audiences by recalling Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's gaffe of telling the Catholic Barrett during her confirmation hearing that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern. The lunchtime panel on stare decisis (the legal doctrine that calls for courts to respect precedent) was full — and several attendees told me it wasn't the topic that drew them, it was the presence of Barrett moderating the panel. Judge, welcome back to Washington — and I hope you'll come back for good sometime soon! one of the panelists, Kannon Shanmugam, an appellate advocate and partner at Williams & Connolly, said to Barrett, drawing cheers from the audience.\\n\\nIn hallways and during panels, networking continued to mix with intellectual ferment. I ran into Josh Blackman, the Texas professor and blogger; he was scheduled to be on a panel where he would urge judges to tweet more and make decisions easier to search online. All the action does go on in the hallway, he told me. At dinner last night I met with friends old and new who had things they wanted to tell me, things they wanted me to think about, things I want to write about. As long as you have your eyes and ears open, you always are able to connect in new ways.\\n\\nChecking out a number of panels, I was impressed that, true to its claim, the Federalist Society really had invited capable liberal advocates to try to rebut conservative perspectives. People always treat me politely in these circumstances, but they always look at me in bemusement about how wrong I am, W. Neil Eggleston, former White House counsel for Obama, quipped during the session on stare decisis. He cautioned the newly empowered majority on the Supreme Court against overturning landmark decisions such as Roe v. Wade just because it could with slim 5-to-4 majorities.\\n\\nMeanwhile, for all the Federalist Society's steamrolling progress on display, I detected a sign of tension that may, too, carry into the future. Near the conclusion of the gala, while McGahn and McConnell are still gloating, I notice a figure standing at a high-top with a drink in the bar area. It's George Conway III, husband of Trump communications counselor Kellyanne Conway. George is surrounded by some friends, and none of them is paying much attention to McGahn and McConnell.\\n\\nGeorge Conway's Federalist Society pedigree is impeccable. He has been a member since 1984 — two years after the founding symposium — and he serves on the society's board of visitors. But he has also publicly criticized his wife's boss's actions on occasion. And he shook the conservative legal establishment when, just before the convention, he and a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers announced the formation of a group called Checks and Balances because, they said, Trump threatens the rule of law. George Conway had even told the New York Times that there's a perception out there that conservative lawyers have essentially sold their souls for judges and regulatory reform.\\n\\nAs I approach, Conway is being congratulated by people coming up from all sides.\\n\\nChecks and Balances! says one admirer.\\n\\nIsn't it great? says Conway.\\n\\nHow's Kellyanne feeling?\\n\\nAh, she could do without it.\\n\\nAnother, much younger lawyer approaches.\\n\\nI got that email, he says.\\n\\nYou going to come? asks Conway, referring to a recruitment meeting planned for the next day.\\n\\nI already put the word out.\\n\\nTurning to me, Conway says: That's one of the young people who just loves what we're doing. … He's a recent law school graduate, a few years out, and a clerk for a really prominent judge here in the District. … The younger people really feel it, and their view is: This will end, the current era. And they're going to be around a long time, and they're not worried that it's going to affect their careers.\\n\\nChecks and Balances, as Conway explains it to me, is not an attack on the Federalist Society but a reminder of the core principles the society has stood for ever since that band of students gathered at Yale. And now, here in a corner of the vast, tingling network, another connection is being made.\\n\\nDavid Montgomery is a staff writer for the magazine."}
{"original": "In April, Vaughn received a letter saying he qualified for $320 a week, but then his file was put on hold until he proved his identity. The fraud check process took nearly six months to clear up. But Vaughn, who is now decorating cakes and stocking shelves at a grocery store, a job that pays about half what he made as a bartender, was still waiting in December for his unemployment benefits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's just so unbelievably difficult to get unemployment. It shouldn't be this hard, especially at a time like this when millions of us are out of work, Vaughn said.\\n\\nVaughn finally received $14,000 in unemployment on Dec. 31 — a few days after The Post inquired about his case with the state of Georgia.\\n\\nThe Post's calculation reflects 703,000 pending appeals across the country and 529,000 people waiting on a benefits decision in the states that publicly share that information or that responded to a request for comment.\\n\\nPeople's claims have been held up for months at times for something as simple as a typo or uploading a scan of a driver's license instead of a photo. Most delays are the result of three key factors: extensive fraud prevention checks, antiquated computer systems and applications being flagged for extra scrutiny. Claims set aside for manual review often take months to resolve.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe holdup in sending out unemployment aid has caused families to fall severely behind on rent, cancel medical treatments and struggle to buy food, according to interviews with more than a dozen people who have yet to receive any money despite applying for unemployment in the spring or summer.\\n\\nThe Post spoke to Americans about the stresses of an uncertain income during the coronavirus pandemic. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe stimulus bill that President Trump signed over the holidays includes an extra $300 a week for the unemployed until mid-March, but that additional money won't help people who are still pending in the unemployment system.\\n\\nThe fact that so many are still waiting for their claims to be processed underscores how unprepared the United States was to deal with this large-scale crisis, analysts say.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe unemployment insurance system has been unfair, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. In Europe, they're paying unemployment through company payrolls, which is a lot simpler and faster. Here, the system has to handle millions of individual cases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Post contacted 20 state unemployment offices. Most stressed that they have doubled or tripled staffing levels, worked weekends and contracted with third parties to process applications as quickly as possible. But Labor Department data shows only eight states are processing the bulk of new applications and sending out payments in three weeks, which was the standard time before the pandemic.\\n\\nWe are still dealing with twice the normal number of claims even today, nine months into the pandemic, while simultaneously continuing to plow through the record onslaught of claims that came in the door from March to June, said Bret Crow, communications director at the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.\\n\\nOhio has hired 150 new unemployment claim adjudicators and more than 1,000 call center agents. Even so, Ohio is among many states that have still not been able to achieve pre-pandemic processing times.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNew Jersey is another state that has been beefing up staff and upgrading its systems. But unemployed people still fall through the cracks.\\n\\nMartin Jones, 39, of Camden, N.J., lost his security guard job in late May and applied for unemployment in June. But there was a glitch: New Jersey kept sending him letters asking why he wanted to resurrect an old claim from the summer of 2019. Despite numerous phone calls explaining he was applying for aid in 2020, it has not been fixed. He was told to refile in September, which he did, but he's still waiting for his first payment.\\n\\nThe very last person I talked to in November basically told me I should keep my fingers crossed and hope it eventually goes through, Jones said. I haven't received a penny.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJones is diabetic and has been relying on charity from family members to buy the food and medicine he needs. In a recent trip to the store, he didn't have enough money for toothpaste and deodorant.\\n\\nAngela Delli Santi, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, declined to comment on Jones's case, but she said the state is seeing a lot of applications with missing information or a complicating factor that often requires the assistance of an experienced agent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nState unemployment offices stressed that most people still waiting for aid don't qualify for the regular unemployment aid program. Instead, these people believe they qualify for the new program Congress created in March called Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, or PUA, that is meant to help gig workers, self-employed workers and parents who had to stop working to take care of a sick relative or watch a school-aged child when schools shut down in-person education.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStates had to implement this new program from scratch in the spring when they were receiving millions of applications each week. Many states are struggling to figure out what proof is acceptable to show a gig worker lost their job because of the pandemic or whether a parent truly left a job to care for a child. Unemployment aid has typically replaced a little less than half of a worker's prior wages, but gig workers often have wages that fluctuate a lot from week to week, another challenge that requires case-by-case calculations.\\n\\nChantel Clark is a mom caught in this PUA limbo. She worked at Macy's for years and was furloughed in March. Both her dad and her father-in-law died of the coronavirus in the spring. Despite her fears of the virus, when Macy's asked her to return to work in June, she went. Then the summer camp for her autistic son closed, leaving Clark and her husband without child care. Clark, 38, says she tried to work out something with Macy's but ultimately had to resign to watch her son.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClark would not have been eligible for unemployment insurance before the pandemic because she voluntarily left her job, but PUA covers parents who were not able to work because of their children's care needs or school shutdowns stemming from the pandemic.\\n\\nI filed for unemployment insurance at the end of July and I haven't received a dime, said Clark, who lives in Alpharetta, Ga. She and her husband recently had to sell one of their two vehicles because they ran out of savings and needed money.\\n\\nWhen Clark finally got through to someone in Georgia's unemployment office, they told her the computer system showed she quit her job, so a senior manager would determine whether she's eligible for PUA. Clark was told a manager would call her to discuss her case in February 2021 — seven months after she initially filed a claim.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClark received a call last week after The Post inquired about her case, but she still has not received any money.\\n\\nI honestly just want to give up. It's so not worth the stress, she said.\\n\\nInvestigations into why someone left their last job are taking much longer during the pandemic. In November 2019, 90 percent were resolved within a month. Now only 40 percent are done in a month. In Georgia, 75 percent of cases like Clark's are taking more than 10 weeks to resolve, Labor Department data shows.\\n\\nBut even people with more straightforward job loss situations are having problems.\\n\\nAngie Ivey, 31, of Atlanta is a mother of three who was laid off from her job in May at a mental health center because so few patients were coming in. She applied for regular unemployment and was denied. She then applied for PUA, but her case has been pending for months.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy unemployment is still pending since August and there is nowhere to turn, Ivey said. You call and wait on hold for hours. Then they hang up or give you a message that says, 'phone system not working.'\\n\\nShe was recently informed there was an IT issue with her case and they needed to manually override it to approve her, but she has yet to receive any money. Ivey, a widow, is $3,000 behind on rent. The family is barely surviving on lunch meat and bread from a nearby church food pantry.\\n\\nSeveral Democratic state representatives sent a letter this month to Georgia's attorney general requesting an investigation into Georgia's inability to pay claims in a timely manner.\\n\\nMark Butler, Georgia's commissioner of labor, said his office has been working quickly to get money out, but it has also experienced a spike in fraudulent claims. More than 4.1 million applications have been processed, but 111,000 were from people who were fired or quit, which requires extra review, and more than 31,000 have been flagged as potentially fraudulent, he said.\\n\\nA huge portion of the issues we have seen with claims stem from individuals who have quit, have been fired, or have not had a job in the past year who believe they are owed benefits from the state regardless of their separation reason, Butler said in a statement. We are responsible for making lawful benefit determinations based on the evidence presented in each case.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has made fraud prevention a top priority, noted Peter Ganong, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago. But it has slowed the distribution of aid.\\n\\nI think we would be better served by focusing on getting benefits out to people who need them and getting them out quickly, Ganong said.\\n\\nIt's a difficult balancing act for states. Bank of America estimates that California paid as much as $2 billion in fraudulent claims. At the same time, a report by California's Employment Development Department Strike Team found that one simplistic fraud-detection technique redirected about 1.4 million claims to manual processing. About 0.02 percent of the claims processed were found to be fraudulent.\\n\\nEfforts to prevent fraud can often hinder legitimate applicants from aid.\\n\\nMichelle Stoltenberg of Pittsburgh thought she had uploaded all the required ID documents: driver's license, passport, gas bill, electric bill, birth certificate and landline phone bill. But when she called to check, Pennsylvania's unemployment office told her a scan of driver's license wasn't acceptable; she needed to photograph it. She did that. Then she was told she needed to upload a photo of the back of her birth certificate — even though it's blank. She did that, too.\\n\\nI applied in July. This has gone on for five months, said Stoltenberg, who has fallen behind on utility bills and put off a surgery. My trust in my government is just fundamentally broken now.\\n\\nStoltenberg, 44, works live music events in Pittsburgh, which stopped in March. She is owed more than $10,000 in back pay from Pennsylvania's unemployment office. Her former employer, a law professor and her state senator are all advocating for her, yet she was not paid until Dec. 31 — just after The Post asked about her case.\\n\\nAnother holdup is the appeals process. When people are denied unemployment, they can appeal, but getting a hearing can take months. Undecided appeals in the United States were open for an average of 82 days at the end of November, according to Labor Department data.\\n\\nRhett Wilkinson is a prime example. The 31-year-old freelance writer has worked for several years doing various writing gigs for companies and newspapers. He had a good job before the pandemic hit, but that firm told him in a note on March 18 that with everything going on in the world right now, we are putting this project on hold and that he was no longer needed.\\n\\nWilkinson, who lives in Utah, applied for PUA in April. He was denied in late August because the state said it wasn't clear whether he lost his job because of the pandemic. He filed for an appeal but did not get a hearing until Nov. 23 — just before Thanksgiving.\\n\\nThe administrative law judge reversed the decision upon my appeal, but I still have not gotten any money, Wilkinson said.\\n\\nState unemployment agencies argue that they are doing the best they can. Many states report hiring hundreds of new adjudicators to handle appeals.\\n\\nThe Oregon Employment Department tripled the number of adjudicators on staff and winnowed down its backlog from 52,000 claims in September to 12,600 in December, despite a coronavirus outbreak at one of the department's offices.\\n\\nOther states have tried more creative solutions. Wisconsin partnered with Google Cloud, while Kentucky and Pennsylvania hired accounting firm Ernst and Young to help work through their backlogs. California stopped accepting applications for two weeks in the fall to work through its backlog. Virginia, facing a potential lawsuit, has begun paying 58,000 workers before their cases are adjudicated — on the condition that they pay the money back if they are found to be ineligible.\\n\\nState unemployment offices are often saddled with decades-old computer systems that delay the implementation of new programs. Oregon was the last state in the nation to waive a one-week waiting period for benefits because it took seven months to reprogram its computer system. Oregon, like many other states, uses a computer system based in a 1960s-era programming language called COBOL.\\n\\nThe latest relief package passed by Congress did not include any additional funding to help state unemployment offices upgrade their computers. An early proposal included $1 billion for such upgrades but that measure was scrapped from the final bill.\\n\\nIt's crazy our computer systems couldn't be programmed to do the right thing, said Glenn Hubbard, former chief economist for George W. Bush and a Columbia Business School professor. Something will happen again someday and we shouldn't be in this position."}
{"original": "That's a reversal from the last two years of Chinese rivals grabbing market share as Beijing doubled down on a drive to increase high-end manufacturing, moving away from the mass market, low-margin goods churned out for the last few decades. Chinese makers of all types of machinery and equipment were nudging out typically upper-end Japanese firms, which warned of waning demand from China and uncertainty around it. Meanwhile, the government's fiscal stimulus helped buoy sentiment for construction-related machinery like hydraulic excavators, where Japanese companies had a firm footing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNot all the pressure came from competitiveness; domestic firms barely stand up against the foreign ones. In 2018, the Ministry of Commerce opened a one-year anti-dumping investigation into Japanese and Taiwanese exporters of vertical-machine centers – key equipment manufacturing facilities for cars and other more sophisticated processes. At the time, as I noted, it was a case of playing spoilsport: The numbers didn't warrant the probe, nor did the impact on prices. Machinery orders had already been slowing, as had shipments for bearings, a proxy for the industry. Citing the complexity, the government extended the case in 2019. By April 2020, it was determined that everything had been fair after all and no duties would be imposed.\\n\\nThe change of tack amid the Covid-19 lockdown and subsequent recovery showed the limits of ambitious industrial policy. China has spent much of the last year focusing on policies to become self-sufficient, scarred by the U.S.-induced rebuke over its practices in global trade and rocky rebound out of the pandemic. A key part of Beijing's economic blueprint for the next five years is to bolster high-end manufacturing of machines, 5G equipment and semiconductors for use in the domestic market. State funding is increasingly being targeted toward these industries. The government also wants to upgrade internal supply chains and maintain its role as the world's factory floor. China is by far the largest end-user of industrial robots, but the number of robots installed per 10,000 employees remains relatively low.\\n\\nIn some sectors like 5G, China has doubtless made significant progress. However, the country will continue to rely on Japanese companies for the high-tech niche of manufacturing for a while to come. Consider this: Chinese suppliers command more than 80% of the market share for simple-task linear and Cartesian robots used in the plastics industry. But when it comes to articulated robots, which have more complex multi-axis movements, foreign makers manufacture droves more in and for China, according to CLSA Ltd. analysts. Such machines accounted for over 60% of sales. Japan is one of the largest exporters of industrial robots.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe fact remains that there's a significant technology gap. More than 75% of reducers, a kind of gear, are imported from Japanese companies like Nabtesco Corp. and Harmonic Drive Systems Inc., according to analysts from HSBC Holdings Plc. These components account for over a third of the cost of industrial robots made in China, compared to 12% for one from Japan. That makes it difficult to be cost-competitive. Chinese companies will have to rely on acquisitions to catch up.\\n\\nFor Japan's machinery giants, that means the trend – and demand – are here to stay. Chinese volumes will drive business and valuations for manufacturers across the sector. Fanuc Corp., whose yellow robots pepper factory floors making products for companies like Apple Inc., reported that sales in China rose 29% in the first nine months of 2020. Despite a seemingly deep Covid-19 slump in Japan's economy, the Tankan business survey shows that conditions for manufacturers are increasingly upbeat. The TOPIX Machinery sub-index is up 30% since June; the broader stock market has risen only 17%. Companies are likely to invest more in China to leverage the focus on that country's inward turn.\\n\\nChina's ascent as an industrial technology champion won't happen tomorrow. Barring the risk of shocks from worsening Covid-19-related lockdowns, though, Japan won't be losing its long-established preeminence anytime soon.\\n\\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.\\n\\nAnjani Trivedi is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Asia.

{"original": "The incoming Biden team is quietly contacting business leaders and their Washington lobbyists, soliciting their input as they fill out personnel and policy plans and signaling they intend to keep open lines of communication once they take power.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe outreach continues today as Business Forward, a group established in the Obama era to connect policymakers from that White House with big business executives and lobbyists, hosts a conference call with Neera Tanden, Biden's nominee for budget director. It will be the first in a series as the group revs back up after lowering its profile in the Trump era.\\n\\nIt is one front in a multi-pronged Biden team push to welcome industry interests into the fold. And it suggests that the incoming Biden administration might more friendly to K Street than President Trump's White House.\\n\\nLobbyists describe the effort as a double-barreled relief.\\n\\nThey say it signals both that top Biden officials will solicit private-sector views and that the administration will restore an orderly policymaking process after four years of Trump-fueled chaos.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a former senior official for to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), tells me the big business lobby has had a lot of engagement with all of the agency teams on Biden's transition.\\n\\nWe've raised issues that we wanted to discuss with them, and they've been incredibly responsive and helped organize meetings, Bradley said. And in some cases, they've been the first to reach out. I think it's a very professional, well-done transition, with systematic engagement.\\n\\nTo his point, Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen and Wally Adeyemo, Biden's pick to serve as her deputy, last month held a virtual roundtable with the National Association of Manufacturers. They discussed the need for more economic relief, and Yellen thanked NAM's leadership for a productive discussion and expressed the incoming administration's interest in maintaining an open dialogue and close working relationship, per a transition team readout.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther executives and lobbyists who want to reach the transition team have two designated contacts there: Kenny Thompson Jr., a former Biden aide most recently an executive at Pepsi; and Theo LeCompte, an Obama commerce department official most recently with Uber.\\n\\nOnce Biden takes office, the responsibility will go to Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), who is set to head the Office of Public Engagement.\\n\\nBut many of Biden's other top hands are establishment stalwarts known to K Street, corporate executives and the donor class.\\n\\nThat roster starts at the top of his West Wing, with chief of staff Ron Klain, a onetime lobbyist and venture capital executive; and it includes deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed, a tribune of business-friendly centrism over more than three decades in Washington; and counselor Steve Ricchetti, another former lobbyist.\\n\\nThe great thing about this administration is the people who are coming in to run it have been there before, one Democratic lobbyist tells me. They have a long history in Washington, and they don't think history started with them.\\n\\nDemocratic strategists tell me executives understand they won't be dictating policy to the Biden team at a moment when the Democratic Party is shifting left. But at a minimum, they welcome a more orderly White House.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe one thing businesses crave from policymakers is stability, because they need to be able to make long-term plans, Democratic strategist Erik Smith says. When I am talking to C-suite people, I'm not hearing left versus right. I'm hearing about stability versus instability. Business leaders know there are going to be winners and losers; they just want a process in place with clear rules of the road.\\n\\nPresident Trump's bid to overturn the results of the election, including pushing senators to object to certifying his electoral college loss today, provides a final reminder of his unstable leadership. Executives have evidently had enough. From CNBC's Sara Eisen:\\n\\nAgainst that backdrop, Business Forward's reemergence indicates a return to a more organized, and orderly, routine.\\n\\nIn an emailed invite, the group described the Tanden call, co-hosted by Small Business for America's Future, as the first of a series of briefings with President-elect Biden's nominees for critical economic, climate, and health care posts. Invites went out to the group's approximately 100,000 grass-roots members — small-businesspeople across the country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBusiness Forward also functioned during the Obama years as an inside-the-Beltway forum for top corporations' Washington hands to gather with senior administration officials, get readouts on the policy agenda and offer feedback. Democratic lobbyists tell me they expect the nonprofit group to revive that role in the Biden era. Business Forward did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe group continued to operate in the Trump administration, but its profile shrunk dramatically, with revenue dropping from nearly $2.6 million in 2016, the last year of President Barack Obama's term, to $571,000 in 2018, the last year for which federal records on its finances are available.

{"original": "That tale is looking a lot less remarkable in the wake of revelations that educators and administrators, feeling pressure from their bosses to boost graduation rates and student performance, allowed many students who did not have the requisite qualifications to graduate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA city study — undertaken after media reports revealed the situation — found that more than 900 of 2,758 students who graduated from a D.C. public school last year either failed to attend enough classes or improperly took makeup classes. At one campus, Anacostia High in Southeast Washington, nearly 70 percent of the 106 graduates received 2017 diplomas despite violating some aspect of city graduation policy.\\n\\nIt was a shock for many people in the District, including, apparently, Antwan Wilson, the chancellor who has been running the district for about a year and said he didn't know anything about the practices that sparked the scandal.\\n\\nBut the truly shocking thing about D.C.'s schools scandal? That it isn't shocking at all. It isn't, at least, to anybody paying attention to the past decade of school reform, which has attempted to run America's public education system as a business. It's a model that advocates say is the only way to improve public education but that critics say is unworkable and even immoral when it comes to children and a valued civic institution.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet even after scandals erupted in district after district, and charter school after charter school, blowing holes in the miracle stories, reformers stuck to their talking points and their programs focused on metrics and outcomes, not inputs and collaboration. No excuses — meaning not hunger or sickness or poverty or anything else was an excuse for poor performance — became a motto of some charter schools when it came to student performance. And test scores became the yardstick used to measure teachers, principals and schools.\\n\\nPolicymakers and school reformers — in the District and across the nation — chose to believe the miracle narrative and ignore warning signs that were there all along.\\n\\nIt didn't matter that assessment experts repeatedly said standardized test scores should not be used for high-stakes decisions and are only a narrow window into how well a student is performing. Administrators used them for big things anyway. They also insisted that every child could be assessed in some way, and in some places, officials forced even teenagers with the cognitive capacity of a 6-month-old to take standardized tests. One boy in Florida had to take one even though he was born without the cognitive part of his brain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, the graduation rate — nationally and in the District — continued to rise, despite scandals revealing that schools were essentially juicing the books to make it seem like they were graduating more students. Scams included phony credit recovery programs, failing to count all students, and, as the District just found out, letting kids graduate without the qualifications required for a diploma.\\n\\nReformers refused to admit, at least publicly, that there are no miracles in education. Student success takes hard work by young people and their teachers and parents, and it takes work not just around school policy but also with housing and health and fiscal and transportation policy.\\n\\nThe D.C. success came out of a reform program started in 2007 by Chancellor Michelle Rhee, continued by the like-minded Kaya Henderson and further pushed along by Rhee-admirer Wilson.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat program began by using test scores to evaluate students, schools and educators (and, for a time, custodians and every other adult in a school building), and included a groundbreaking performance pay system paid for by philanthropists, the spread of charter schools and vouchers, and a chronic churn in teachers and principals that Rhee saw as healthy (even though research shows children, especially from low-income families, need stability). She was, after all, shown in 2008 on the cover of Time magazine, holding a broom, which infuriated educators who felt as if she were painting them all as ineffective.\\n\\nBut teachers and others who expressed concern that she was rushing to implement untested reforms were (at best) ignored. They were called defenders of the status quo, with the status quo being a bad thing. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has made clear her disdain for the traditional public education system, uses that term now to describe her critics, along with sycophants of the system.\\n\\nIn the District, standardized test scores — which are highly correlated to Zip code and family income — did indeed dramatically rise over the past decade. But officials didn't like to mention that proficiency rates of D.C. students would still be considered failing in a high-performing district or that a wide achievement gap persists between white students and black and Hispanic students. Some in the District also say that test scores rose because the percentage of white students — who traditionally do better on standardized tests — has grown in District schools in recent years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe problems were known, but not acknowledged, by officials. In 2011, Bill Turque, then The Washington Post's D.C. schools reporter, wrote that Rhee's focus on test scores did indeed bring big gains — and more big headlines — for the city. He also said:\\n\\nBut the produce-or-else testing culture that she fostered — tying portions of some evaluations to growth in scores and securing commitments from principals to hit numerical targets — created a climate of fear, in the view of many school employees. It also coincided with evidence of cheating on annual city tests.\\n\\nA climate of fear in a school has never been known to produce much of anything useful.\\n\\nThe graduation rate in District schools has risen steadily — hitting 73 percent in spring 2017 — a 20-point gain since 2011. But even though genuine graduation gains are not easy to attain, officials never publicly questioned some of the miracle graduation stories in D.C. schools. In fact, Wilson's strategic plans calls for an 85 percent graduation rate within four years and 90 percent within five years. A five-percentage-point increase in a year? How realistic is that?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe assessment system, known as IMPACT, that was introduced by Rhee and continued by Henderson, drew serious concerns from teachers and principals, who found it unworkable and unfair, with performance goals that were impossible to meet and metrics that were questionable. But officials would not concede that it was severely flawed, choosing instead to change it repeatedly under the guise of making something good even better. The pressure that IMPACT placed on educators and administrators — pressure that led to cheating on tests and phony graduation rates — was never acknowledged, at least until the new scandal.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that scandals often have many layers. There may be good reasons that some students were allowed to graduate without all of the qualifications, and it may make sense to review the validity of the requirements.\\n\\nBut it is clear that the system broke down and that officials either didn't know about it because people who report to them didn't confess — or they knew and didn't want to let the public know. How long this has been going on is unclear, but it is not likely it was just in 2017.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis raises the question of what else Michelle Rhee and Kaya Henderson should have known — and what Antwan Wilson doesn't know now — about goings-on in the D.C. school system. Did the reforms they implemented in the name of accountability have processes that would really hold people accountable?\\n\\nThe city report, ordered by Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, highlighted deficiencies in the system around the graduation issue, including that most DCPS high schools exhibited a culture of passing and graduating students because of a variety of institutional pressures."}
{"original": "Throwing a party during an Arctic blast or after a blizzard is a wonderful way to bring housebound friends together to try to forget the misery that is the outdoors. Consider the weather when planning your party, say entertaining experts, and channel hygge, the Danish winter mode that involves hot tea, hand-knit throws and log fires. Dump the icy cocktails, heat up some glogg and get a fire going, even if it's a fire pit in the back yard. Light lots of candles and serve comfort foods. What you want for a winter party is an atmosphere of coziness and warmth — both mentally and physically.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think that when people come in out of the cold, it's so nice to give them something in a mug that will warm their hands, says Susan Gage, founder of the Washington catering firm that bears her name. It makes them feel welcome immediately. She suggests hearty food, such a boeuf bourguignon and warm bread pudding or apple crisp.\\n\\nIf your home follows a no-shoes policy, you might want to make an exception. In the winter, women aren't used to being barefoot, says Mindy Lockard, an etiquette expert and consultant. Our toes might not be well kept or we might have a hole in our sock. Relax your rules about shoes, or at least provide a basket of socks.\\n\\nHosts should keep their homes at a temperature that most people feel comfortable. Lockard says there are no strict guidelines about this, but she would recommend a starting party temperature of 70 to 73 degrees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs a host, it's important to monitor and adjust the temperature during a party as it's important to adjust the music, says Carla McDonald, founder of the Salonniere, a website dedicated to the art of entertaining. A house full of people and a hot stove may raise the temperatures a bit as the party plays on.\\n\\nPeople who know they run cold will position themselves near a fireplace or heating vent, But don't make a scene about this, Lockard says. Guests should have some forethought to bring a wrap or something that doubles as insulation. Raiding the coat closet is a party downer. You don't want to put on your puffy coat, she says. That signals you are ready to go home and that kind of breaks up the energy of the party.\\n\\nThe comfort of your guests is one of the main aspects of being hospitable, says Steven Stolman, a lifestyle consultant whose latest book is The Serial Entertainer's Passion for Parties. The temperature of a venue is as important as the lighting and the decor, he says. To guests, Stolman says not to suffer in silence; ask your host directly whether you can borrow a sweater or throw. Or politely suggest they raise the thermostat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWould Stolman dare to turn up the heat himself? He didn't rule it out. I'm pretty fearless, he says. I'm the kind of person who hates bright lighting, and I will look for the dimmer in the dining room and adjust the lights down.\\n\\nLockard says helping yourself to the thermostat is a no-no. Being mindful of the collective experience is important; if you do that you are assuming that other people are also uncomfortable or you're not caring about them, she says.\\n\\nYour best bet, McDonald says, is to tough it out and give your host some slack. Some hosts may still be learning about everything that goes into throwing a great party, she says.\\n\\nCan't see the Poll?Click Here.\\n\\nSo hosts, here are a few tips for welcoming friends into your home, even during a future Snowmageddon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarm up. Nudge your thermostat up a few degrees higher than you normally would for the start of your party, as guests arrive from the Arctic chill. You can turn it down if it seems warm later from all the additional bodies and your hot oven.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCreate ambiance. Make a fire, whether gas or wood-burning, to add a cozy feel to your gathering. Light lots of candles; even candlelight can make you feel warmer. McDonald says a grouping of candles at the center of your dinner table gives a nice glow.\\n\\nStart with a nice welcome. Greet guests with a mug of cider you've heated up on the stove or some soup, Gage says. Stage a hot chocolate bar, says McDonald, or a Scotch bar. I would not do frozen margaritas, Gage says.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnticipate soggy coats and footwear. Create a spot with a rug or tray and a chair for guests to take off boots at the door. If you don't like shoes in your house, provide a basket of new socks in several colors that guests can help themselves to and take home as party favors, Gage suggests. Empty your own coat closet for the night so guests can hang up their many layers of outerwear instead of dragging them into a bedroom.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBe ready with wardrobe reinforcements. Keep some wraps around in case people are cold. Stolman stocks up on cheap pashminas from New York street vendors when he's up north. McDonald says it's nice to gather around a fire or fire pit and pass out inexpensive little throws, all in the same color. McDonald says, It will create warmth for your guests and the perfect Instagramable moment for your party with everyone wrapped in one."}
{"original": "The paper ballot mandate puts the new House majority at odds with the Department of Homeland Security, which has left the door open for machines that record votes digitally but print out a physical paper trail so votes can be audited if there's any suspicion of hacking. It also tees up a fight with the Republican-controlled Senate, which has been wary of imposing strict requirements on states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, the push for paper ballots was met with applause and optimism by some election security advocates who hope the 2020 election will be more secure than the midterms.\\n\\nPaper ballots, that's the biggest win in this bill, said Matt Bernhard, an election security advocate with the group Verified Voting. This is about as aggressive as you can see anyone at the federal level being in terms of actually passing meaningful legislation.\\n\\nIt may face an uphill climb, though: The For the People Act, which also includes provisions to expand voting access and increase campaign finance disclosures, is an early peek at Democrats' top priorities for the session -- but bipartisan cooperation is more stalled than ever as large parts of the federal government are still shut down amid a dispute with President Trump over border funding.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe fight over election security specifically has always come down to a delicate balance -- and this go-round is likely to be as contentious as ever.\\n\\nOn one hand, the federal government and many Republicans are wary of imposing too many security mandates on states for fear of undermining a constitutional balance of powers that gives states broad authority to manage their own elections. On the other hand, states simply aren't equipped to defend themselves against an ultrasophisticated hacking operation backed by Russia or another cybersecurity adversary.\\n\\nDemocrats view tying a paper ballot and other minimum security requirements to new grant money as a partnership with states rather than an imposition, Rep. Jim Langevin (D-R.I.) told me in December while the bill was still being finalized.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is not going to be at all the federal government coming down to tell states how to run their elections, said Langevin who co-founded the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus and was formerly Rhode Island's top state election official.\\n\\nRepublicans are likely to have a different view. The Secure Elections Act, a bipartisan bill in the Republican-controlled Senate last session, didn't go nearly as far as this latest House bill and still never reached a floor vote. That bill basically punted on the question of paper ballots — leaving final security recommendations up to an independent advisory commission.\\n\\nAnd a House bill that required paper ballots won 126 Democratic co-sponsors last Congress, but not a single Republican one. A Senate bill from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that mandated paper ballots won 14 Democratic co-sponsors and no Republicans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile House Democrats' demand for paper ballots is pretty tough, the mandate is worth it, Bernhard told me. A paper ballot is better than a digital ballot with a physical paper trail, he told me, because it guards against sophisticated hackers making a voting machine record one vote but spit out a paper receipt for another.\\n\\nBernhard's position is fairly common among voting security experts, although some allow wiggle room for paper trails provided those systems are paired with risk-limiting audits after the election. A risk-limiting audit is essentially a hand check of a representative sample of paper ballots or paper trails to make sure the machines that read votes are tallying them correctly.\\n\\nAs of the 2018 midterm elections, only five states lacked any paper record of votes — Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, New Jersey and Delaware — but many more were using paper trails rather than paper ballots.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe For the People Act mandates risk-limiting audits but gives states five years to implement them as opposed to the paper ballot requirement, which would go into effect before the 2020 presidential election. Both mandates are tied to receiving election security grant money.\\n\\nThe bill includes numerous other cybersecurity provisions too.\\n\\nAmong other things, it would impose new cybersecurity and transparency requirements on companies that produce election hardware and software and create a bug bounty program that offers ethical hackers cash rewards for spotting vulnerabilities in voting systems.\\n\\nThat slate of changes would be a major improvement in election security, but states will need significant federal grants to make them happen, Mark Weatherford, senior vice president at the security company vArmour and a former DHS cybersecurity official, told me.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are many opportunities to improve the current systems of voting, which should absolutely be tied to requirements for receiving federal grant funding, Weatherford said. I believe that most Americans would see this as a nonpartisan issue.\\n\\nPINGED, PATCHED, PWNED\\n\\nPINGED: The partial government shutdown is well into its third week this morning and is hampering DHS's work standing up its new Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Inside Cybersecurity's Charlie Mitchell and Mariam Baksh reported.\\n\\nAbout 43 percent of CISA staff are furloughed during the shutdown, according to a DHS planning document. CISA staff are responsible for securing government websites and assisting with the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure, such as hospitals and airports.\\n\\nWorking with just over half your staff may seem like a skeleton crew, but compare it to the government's go-to agency for cybersecurity standards, the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Just 484 of NIST's 3,378 employees are exempt from furlough, or about 14 percent, according to planning documents.\\n\\nPATCHED: Sens. Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) introduced a bill that would create an Office of Critical Technologies and Security at the White House to coordinate the federal government's response to technology threats from China and other countries.

Politicians have blamed the agency for not responding sooner to the data leak — which includes addresses, phone numbers, chat messages and credit card numbers — after it emerged in December. In a statement, the agency acknowledged it was approached by one lawmaker about suspicious activity on his private email and social media accounts in early December, but said it believed at the time his experience was a one-off case, according to the AP.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGovernment officials said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier were among the politicians whose personal data was leaked, according to the Wall Street Journal's Ruth Bender. The far-right Alternative for Germany was the only party that did not have data that was leaked. Twitter on Friday shut down an account that was used to spread the data. The suspended Twitter account showed posts linking to data archives stretching back to Dec. 1 and repeating daily in the manner of an advent calendar, which is popular among children in Germany in the run-up to Christmas, Bender reported.\\n\\nPUBLIC KEY\\n\\n— Reps.

Additionally, the bill would codify the position of federal chief information security officer, who would report to the federal CIO.\\n\\nThis bill helps keep the vast information stored by the federal government secure from hackers by making clear that the Federal CIO is in charge of the security of our data across the government, Hurd said in a statement.

{"original": "For days after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced that the potentially lifesaving vaccine would be available to seniors, Shlevin had no idea when she and her husband would have a chance at it.\\n\\nYou had at least six months to get ready. You could have figured out a better way to do this, said Shlevin, of Pompano Beach, Fla. It shouldn't be this hard.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter months of anticipation, millions of doses of the two authorized coronavirus vaccines — made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna — are flowing into hospitals and health departments across the nation, putting the end of the pandemic in sight. But Americans trying to access shots are encountering systems that vary widely county to county and that, in many places, are overwhelmed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome counties and hospital systems launched reservation websites, only for them to quickly become booked or crash. Others announced appointments only through Facebook, with slots filling before some residents knew to look. And many have not revealed how the vaccine will be made available to anyone beyond health-care workers and long-term care residents and employees, the focus of the first round of vaccinations.\\n\\nIn one striking image, Florida health departments offering doses on a first-come, first-served basis saw scores of older residents bring lawn chairs and blankets and camp out overnight.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Sunday, Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser to Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's effort to expedite development and delivery of vaccines, mostly deflected questions about the lag in administering shots, saying on CBS's Face the Nation that his team is available for requests from states for assistance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe need to improve, he acknowledged.\\n\\nAcross the United States, limited funding has undermined end-of-year efforts to hire coronavirus vaccine staff, create vaccination centers and raise awareness. (Reuters)\\n\\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams said vaccine administration was accelerating, with 1.5 million doses given in two days. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, Adams said Sunday he's still optimistic about the national outlook for defeating the virus, even as only 4 million of the 14 million doses delivered to states have been administered, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention figures.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFederal officials had estimated 20 million doses of the coveted vaccine would be delivered and administered by the end of 2020. Adams pointed to a strain on resources brought on by the nationwide surge in covid-19 cases and by the holidays as possible causes of the slower-than-expected rollout, while President Trump has blamed states.\\n\\nI'm telling you that things are changing, Adams said, adding that the administration's coronavirus task force is working every single day to figure out how we can help the states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the state and local level, authorities urge patience as they sort out distribution plans. Michael Kilkenny, physician director of West Virginia's Cabell-Huntington Health Department, described it as a massive logistical operation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI understand that anxiety and I understand that desire to get their vaccine, and so we feel a little pressure when the vaccine hasn't flowed as fast as we'd like, he said. But we also realize that this is not something that's been sitting on shelves for five years. This is brand-new stuff.\\n\\nThere has been confusion over when, where and how to get the shot, with different jurisdictions taking different approaches in the nation's patchwork, decentralized public health system.\\n\\nEven health-care workers have struggled to figure it out. Marla Deibler, a psychologist in New Jersey, said people in her line of work were unsure whether they qualified, with professional listservs full of questions about the vaccine. Through lots of investigating, she found a hospital that was inoculating health-care workers and made an appointment by phone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe state on Wednesday sent providers an email listing vaccination sites. By then, she'd already been pricked.\\n\\nIn my experience, just because there hasn't been a central plan, it just hasn't been managed well in terms of how to carry this out, Deibler said. But once we knew what to do, it went very smoothly.\\n\\nWhether you can easily access appointments or information about how to get in line depends on where you live. Officials in some areas are telling residents not in the top priority health-care group to hold tight, while others have been more proactive.\\n\\nIn several states, health officials were caught off guard when governors suddenly announced availability would expand to senior citizens or others. Some state officials chose to depart from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for the second vaccination priority group, which prioritized front-line essential workers alongside people 75 and older.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's been understandable hiccups — this is a big program, it came just as we were entering the holidays, said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. There are many aspects that are complicated here. But the number of people that's been actually vaccinated has been, I think, below a lot of people's expectations.\\n\\nNew Mexico has a website where residents can register in advance to be vaccinated and find out, via text message, whether to keep waiting or head to a specific location to get the shot. D.C. launched a similar portal, with text at the bottom of the page saying it is currently open only for healthcare providers. Some were puzzled, though, because the survey allows nonmedical personnel to proceed.\\n\\nI'd read right past that text on the first page & had nearly submitted before a friend mentioned I shouldn't, said one tweet to the health department. Could the survey end itself if you later answer No to the question of whether you're in these groups?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeveral Oklahoma counties posted vaccine sign-ups on their Facebook pages; some residents complained they weren't given notice and that many were still unaware of how to get an appointment.\\n\\nIn Texas, the Department of State Health Services created an online map showing all the providers that have received a vaccine shipment. Before it can be viewed, a pop-up warns that not all providers are vaccinating the public or people in all priority groups and directs users to call in advance.\\n\\nBut after Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and state health commissioner John Hellerstedt pressed for vaccine providers to move more quickly, some clinics saw lines form outside. The commissioner had said in a statement there was no need to ensure that everyone in the first priority group — health-care workers and staff and residents of long-term care facilities — was vaccinated before moving onto the next, which in Texas includes senior citizens and those with underlying conditions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOfficials with the Northeast Texas Public Health District were surprised Wednesday when hundreds of people, mostly seniors, showed up at a vaccine clinic it was hosting in Tyler. Of the 1,000 doses the agency received so far, nearly 600 were administered in one day. George T. Roberts Jr., the health district's chief executive, said it had gone amazingly well, under the circumstances.\\n\\nOur plan was ultimately to have it only by appointments, he said. But today the word of mouth got out, and it was basically first-come, first-served.\\n\\nHospitals and county health departments in Florida scrambled to accommodate the demand after DeSantis's Dec. 23 announcement that the state would prioritize seniors over essential workers. Counties and hospitals were left to make plans on their own, with the governor saying Wednesday that each would be offering the vaccine in ways that best fit the needs of that particular community. That approach, he added, cuts out the middle man.\\n\\nAt Memorial Healthcare System in Broward County, officials responded to the governor's mandate by asking his office for more doses, according to system spokeswoman Kerting Baldwin. They made the request Tuesday and had not yet heard back, she said Wednesday, adding that the hospital system is receiving calls from people who want the vaccine, but it is not available at this time. Broward Health, another health-care system in the county, was inundated with calls and is booked for appointments through February.\\n\\nOn the opposite side of the state, Lee County authorities announced that anyone older than 65 could be inoculated, no appointment necessary. They decided it was the most expeditious way to get vaccine out, County Commission Chairman Kevin Ruane said, and asked the public not to camp out like they were waiting for a concert or Black Friday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut people did, he said. I have every ounce of sympathy for what they're going through.\\n\\nAmong them were Fort Myers residents Barbara Hooper, 69, and her husband, Michael, 71, who arrived at a vaccine site near their home at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday. They brought water and chairs. The line stretched down the block.\\n\\nAt 6:30 a.m., the couple got the Moderna shot.\\n\\nWaiting in line wasn't the end of the world, Hooper said. The main thing everybody in line was talking about was how excited we were to get the shot.\\n\\nBut Florida should have had a centralized, state-managed plan, the sole Democratic member of the Florida Cabinet said, blasting the lack of preparation and progress as inexcusable. Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried urged the governor to mobilize the National Guard, writing in a Wednesday letter that vulnerable Floridians had been left without answers or clear direction from overwhelmed local agencies on when, where and how to receive the vaccine.\\n\\nWhen the Broward County health department announced an online vaccine portal, Shlevin hurried to try it. She thought she'd managed to snag appointments in February — until she tried to hit confirm and found out they were no longer available. After that, the site went down.\\n\\nIn messages posted to Twitter, agency officials apologized that their website did not work as intended. They said they recognized that older residents were anxious to get the shot, noting this is just the beginning of COVID-19 vaccination opportunities.\\n\\nBy Saturday, after requesting a call through the Broward Health system website, Shlevin had heard back. She and her husband have appointments to get vaccinated this month. They're thrilled — but she still thinks the process could have been smoother.\\n\\nI understand the logistics, but growing up in the '50s and '60s, when they came around with the polio vaccine, they managed to get it done, Shlevin said. I remember getting shots at the fire station when I was in school. We're a huge country, but this can be done, with some planning."}
{"original": "In 2017, Trump's first year in office, he continued to insist on the urgent need for a border wall, even as illegal crossings dropped further.\\n\\nWith parts of the federal government shut down over what has morphed into the defining symbol of Trump's presidency, administration officials are clamoring louder than ever. Only this time, they face a bona fide emergency on the border, and they're struggling to make the case there's truly a problem.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPresident Trump said Jan. 4 that he is considering declaring a national emergency to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall without approval from Congress. (Reuters)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRecord numbers of migrant families are streaming into the United States, overwhelming border agents and leaving holding cells dangerously overcrowded with children, many of whom are falling sick. Two Guatemalan children taken into U.S. custody died in December.\\n\\nIn a letter to lawmakers Friday, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security made a fresh appeal to amend immigration laws they denounce as legal loopholes and blame for creating a border security and humanitarian crisis. But the chance of reaching consensus for such technical fixes to U.S. immigration statutes is growing more remote, buried by the pitched battle over a structure new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) calls immoral.\\n\\nWith both sides entrenched, there has been little bipartisan urgency to examine the relatively narrow set of legal and administrative changes that could potentially make a difference in slowing illegal migration or improving conditions for families who arrive at the border.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are places that need better fences or better walls; no one denies that, said Anthony Earl Wayne, a U.S. diplomat who served as ambassador to Mexico from 2011 to 2015. But I don't know how you get to that, while explaining to the public that we need to increase border security while meeting the human needs that are there.\\n\\nInstead, the policy debate has been overshadowed by an engineering project imbued with partisan emotion, with Trump fighting for billions of dollars in taxpayer funding and threatening to invoke emergency powers to build a wall without congressional approval. After failing to reach a deal with Democratic leaders, Trump seesawed Friday between characterizing the current border crisis as a dangerous horrible disaster and warning that the shutdown could stretch for months or years.\\n\\nDemocratic leaders, pressed by liberal groups and immigrant rights activists, have dug in against Trump, accusing the president of pursuing a xenophobic agenda and throwing a temper tantrum, in the words of Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe risk of a prolonged stalemate is increasing as the wall fight becomes a referendum on the president, leaving little space to negotiate changes to the lesser-known statutes some administration officials see as the key to stanching the border surge.\\n\\nThis is the triumph of symbolism over policy solutions, said Tamar Jacoby, a conservative who serves as president of ImmigrationWorks, a federation of small businesses that advocates for immigration reform.\\n\\nTo find the balance between a humanitarian approach and an approach that encourages people to come in responsibly is not easy. It has to be handled carefully, thoughtfully and delicately, she said. But the debate going on is one of cartoon characters jousting when what we need are brain surgeons.\\n\\nThe impasse marks Washington's latest failure in over nearly three decades of trying to reach consensus on a comprehensive overhaul of a massive immigration system that both political parties agree is largely broken. There are an estimated 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, according to a recent estimate from Pew Research Center, and there is no political consensus over their future.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's most recent predecessors, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Barack Obama, supported unsuccessful bipartisan legislative efforts.\\n\\nCurrent White House aides acknowledge privately that a wall will not adequately address the record surge of immigrant families at the border — most of whom surrender to authorities in hopes of winning asylum protections.\\n\\nLast year, the Trump administration opposed and helped defeat a bipartisan Senate plan that would have provided $25 billion for the wall in exchange for a path to citizenship for up to 1.7 million young undocumented immigrants.\\n\\nThe president put his support behind a more conservative bill that would have amended loopholes in immigration law, allowing the administration to detain families for longer periods and speed up the huge backlog of asylum cases. But that plan, which also included massive cuts to legal immigration programs, was soundly defeated, as Democrats opposed rolling back protections for immigrant families.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSince then, Trump has attempted to use executive powers to tighten immigration rules, but during the summer he ended his administration's policy of separating migrant children from their parents amid political backlash. Federal courts have blocked other hard-line measures from the administration, prompting Trump to focus on the border wall.\\n\\nDuring a news conference Friday, Trump discussed ways to seize private land for the project, waxed on about the merits of a barrier made of steel instead of concrete, asserted falsely that Mexico would pay for it through a new trade agreement and repeated his warnings of terrorists at the border.\\n\\nBut he only briefly alluded to the humanitarian crisis, suggesting a wall would be the solution by dissuading women and children from attempting a dangerous journey.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf they know they can't get through because we have a great border wall or fence or barrier, they're not going to come up and you're not going to have the problem, Trump said.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, so many parents with children have been among the 2,000 unauthorized migrants who are being taken into federal custody each day that authorities have resorted to mass releases of families onto the streets of El Paso and other border cities. U.S. agents are bringing dozens of migrants coughing and feverish each day to clinics and hospitals after stays in jam-packed holding cells where children sleep on concrete floors and huddle in plastic sheets for warmth.\\n\\nA group of Democratic lawmakers led by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will travel to New Mexico on Monday to the Border Patrol station where 8-year-old Felipe Alonso Gomez was detained before he died on Christmas Eve with flulike symptoms. But Democrats critical of the administration's treatment of migrant families have offered few solutions to stem the unprecedented influx of parents with children that is buckling the U.S. immigration system.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe government shutdown has made the strains worse. Many immigration judges have been furloughed, deepening dysfunction in a court system crippled by a backlog of nearly 1 million cases. Along the border, U.S. agents and officers are being forced to work indefinitely without pay. Morale is down in the dumps, said one border agent in South Texas who was not authorized to speak on the record.\\n\\nYet in Washington, the president has continued to sound the alarm for a border wall, appearing at the White House on Thursday with representatives of the Border Patrol union to make another pitch to reporters.\\n\\nAdam Isacson, a security analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, said there appears to be little political incentive for conservatives to hash out a deal if it doesn't deliver on Trump's signature issue. With Trump eyeing a reelection bid amid increasing pressure from his conservative base, the debate over the wall could dominate Washington for the foreseeable future."}
{"original": "Multiple TV journalists have flatly declared that Trump has revealed himself as a racist. It's good that it's now safe to say this on prime-time television, but we already knew that. What this episode also does is shatter the endless euphemisms and dissembling that Trump and his allies have employed to obscure a related truth: that the nationalism at the core of Trumpism is heavily driven by a reactionary backlash to the current ethnic and racial mix of the U.S. population — it is white nationalism, despite all the what-me-racist protestation to the contrary.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's comments also reveal that this basic truth is shaping the White House's policy stances in the current immigration debate, something that is also being obscured with all sorts of rhetorical trickery. Trump's comments have upended the negotiations underway over a deal to protect the dreamers. But it can no longer be denied that Trump opposes the deal at least in part because it does not do enough to resist or roll back ongoing racial and demographic trends.\\n\\nPresident Trump referred to African nations and Haiti as shithole countries on Jan. 11. Here are other nations he has insulted. (Melissa Macaya/The Washington Post)\\n\\nConsider the particulars of the current immigration talks and Trump's response to them. In the White House, a bipartisan group of senators yesterday presented an agreement that would grant protected status to the dreamers who were brought here illegally as children, pump more money into border security, tweak family-based immigration and end the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which distributes visas to countries with historically low immigration rates, many in Africa and Central Asia, channeling those visas to some U.S. residents with temporary protected status (TPS) from countries like El Salvador, Nicaragua and Haiti, a program Trump is rolling back.\\n\\nTrump reportedly reacted to a discussion of that last component of the deal by saying: Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here? before suggesting the United States should instead allow in more people from countries like Norway. Trump now claims he only used tough language about this deal, but his reported comments illuminate his actual policy stance: Trump is, in fact, rejecting the deal because it lets in too many people from what he thinks are shithole countries, or lets too many of them remain.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump objects to the agreement because he claims it makes so-called chain migration (family-based immigration) and the lottery system worse, meaning we must take in large numbers of people from high crime … countries which are doing badly. That openly concedes that Trump wants fewer people from those countries here.\\n\\nThe meaning of this is plain. Trump has claimed he objects to the lottery program because it admits terrorists, but he still objects to the deal reached on it because it still allows people (those with TPS) from the wrong countries, the shithole countries, to remain. He wants more funding for the wall, which is symbolic, yes, but that's exactly the point: As Frank Sharry of America's Voice puts it to me, the wall is a middle finger to Latin America, a statement that we don't want your kind. It's a middle finger to shithole countries, but more to the point, it's a statement that we don't want the people from them.\\n\\nTrump also opposes the current deal because it would restrict family-based immigration (in which current immigrant citizens or permanent residents sponsor relatives for entry) only for the parents of the dreamers and some others, whereas Trump wants much greater reductions in family-based immigration. But as Dara Lind points out, while this debate is complicated, this functionally means large reductions in the numbers of people from countries who already have large immigrant populations here — which means resisting trends shaping our current ethnic and national mix.\\n\\nIn light of Trump's apparent claim that he wants to prioritize people from countries such as Norway, the uglier white nationalist cast of all of this is inescapable. Trump's fellow travelers have gone to great lengths to obscure this basic reality. In a now-infamous exchange, CNN's Jim Acosta asked White House immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller whether Trump's policies are designed to engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country. Miller reacted with outrage and repeatedly cast the goal as reducing the mere numbers of immigrants — ostensibly to protect U.S. workers from competition — which he said was in keeping with previous periods of lower immigration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is very hard to disentangle the goal of reducing the overall numbers of immigrant arrivals from the goal of shifting our current ethnic and racial mix. But Trump has now left little to no doubt that the real animating impulse is the latter.\\n\\n* TRUMP'S 'SHITHOLE' COMMENT DRAWS GLOBAL CONDEMNATION: The Post tallies up all the criticism pouring in from around the world:\\n\\nThe reaction from United Nations human rights spokesman, Rupert Colville, was uncharacteristically blunt. He described the remarks as racist. … In El Salvador, the news of the comments quickly shot to the top of media websites. … In Haiti, people took to Twitter to share pictures of their country — verdant green hills, palm trees in the sunset, and sparkling turquoise water. … In Africa, similar reactions celebrating the beauty of the continent's countries.\\n\\nWe are only beginning to glimpse the damage that Trump is doing to America's standing in the world.\\n\\n* TRUMP JUST WEAKENED HIS OWN LEVERAGE: NBC News's Jonathan Allen notes that Trump's shithole comments may have made it harder for him to get a deal on the dreamers, meaning he'll now have to give up more:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf Trump wants a big immigration deal now, he'll have to give a lot more to both Democrats and Republicans who want a more compassionate approach, said Ali Noorani, executive director of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum. … The backlash against the president's comments [may] make it harder for Democrats to vote for a deal he likes, forcing him to make concessions that could anger his own base to win majorities in the House and Senate.\\n\\nHe really is the greatest dealmaker, believe me.\\n\\n* JEFF FLAKE DEFENDS DEMOCRATS: Trump tweeted last night that Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) responded:\\n\\nPeople scoff at Flake for voting with Trump and the GOP, but this sort of thing actually has some value — we need more Republicans defending the norms that Trump is shredding.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n* TRUMP'S LANGUAGE IS UNFIT FOR CHILDREN: Jake Tapper actually had to say this on CNN, in his introduction to a segment on Trump's shithole comments: Parents with children, you might want to mute for the next 35 seconds. This is what we've come to, folks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n* IMMIGRATION DEAL FACES TOUGHER ROAD IN HOUSE: Senators have reached a deal in principle to protect the dreamers that includes some limits on family-based immigration and border security. But as CNN's Lauren Fox points out:\\n\\nIn the Republican-controlled House … the differences between Democrats and Republicans are even greater. House Speaker Paul Ryan has far more hardline immigration hawks in his conference. Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, has far more members who are opposed to any kind of deal that set back the parents of DACA recipients either by limiting chain migration or other mechanisms.\\n\\nIt seems obvious that a deal can pass only with a lot of Democrats, so the trick for Democratic leaders will be to thread the needle by keeping just enough Dems on board to offset the conservatives who vote no.\\n\\n* PAUL RYAN EXPLAINS WHITE HOUSE POSITION TO TRUMP: Trump yesterday got confused and tweeted opposition to a surveillance bill supported by the White House and most Republicans. The Post reports on what came next:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) spent 30 minutes on the phone with the president explaining the differences between domestic and foreign surveillance, as many fellow Republicans reacted in disbelief and befuddlement. White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly also directly intervened with Trump, reiterating the program's importance before traveling to the Capitol, where he parried questions from confused lawmakers.\\n\\nRemember when conservative pundits and some reporters were telling us how Trump's ability to sit through an immigration meeting showcased his blazing competence?\\n\\n* REPUBLICANS TELL THEMSELVES EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE: The Washington Examiner reports on the state of mind among Republicans as they contemplate the coming midterm elections:\\n\\nWith so many Republicans in Congress having been elected since the GOP wave elections of 2010 and 2014, few have experience in withstanding the sort of strong headwinds generated by full control of government and an unpopular president of their own party. Many Republicans appear unconvinced that major Democratic gains are even possible this November. … they are comforting themselves with the memory of Trump's unlikely victory, in defiance of long political odds and expert prognosticators."}
{"original": "AD\\n\\nThere have been two prevailing and very polarized reactions to the op-ed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne is that Romney is setting himself up to lead the anti-Trump wing of the Republican Party (such as it is currently constituted) . ..\\n\\n. . . and the other is very understandable skepticism that he'll actually put his conduct where his mouth is.\\n\\nThe argument for the latter is evident. Trump's top critics in the Senate GOP — Jeff Flake (Ariz.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), Ben Sasse (Neb.) and, for a time, Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) — talked a big game but did little to impact Trump's actions. The first two opted for retirement, with Flake waving a white flag in the face of Trumpism and really only using his legislative prerogatives toward the end of his tenure. Graham, once critical, is now a top Trump ally who occasionally criticizes his foreign policy. All have regularly voted with the president's priorities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRomney's history with Trump suggests he could follow a similar path.\\n\\nRomney criticized Trump in more severe terms than just about anybody in 2016, even after Trump was the de facto GOP nominee. But he's also been happy to play ball and accept his help. As the GOP presidential nominee in 2012, he flew out to accept an endorsement from Trump, then in the throes of birtherism. After Trump was elected president, Romney interviewed to be Trump's secretary of state.\\n\\nWhen Romney decided to run for Senate, he accepted Trump's endorsement again and backed off his previous criticisms of the leader. At a debate three months ago, Romney was asked three times whether he still thought Trump was a fraud and a phony. I'm going to talk about the future, he responded.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis op-ed seems, in part, to be an effort to explain his many about-faces. In the piece, Romney emphasized twice that he's particularly appalled by this past month of Trump's presidency. This may be true, but it's also an extremely convenient line. After all, Trump's Cabinet has been trending toward less-experienced yes-men for a long time, a phenomenon that accelerated after the 2018 election. Trump's character has been pretty consistent throughout. Romney's point about Trump and the damage to U.S. alliances is also something you could have said for much of the past two years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut that doesn't mean Romney will necessarily fail to act as a check on Trump's power. Even if Romney chose political expediency before, he could feel this is his chance to effect change, now that he's actually got a Washington job. It's worth entertaining the idea that Romney truly believes his past Trump criticisms and now wants to do something about them — or at least try. I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault, Romney writes. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.\\n\\nRomney has a bigger platform than any of the four GOP senators mentioned above. He also has more experience as a national voice. He may view this as a chance to right the ship in the GOP and the country — or even set himself up for another presidential bid if Trump and Trumpism falters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI find this so troubling, and I know a lot of folks are saying, 'Mitt, just get off your high horse on this and get behind the guy,' Romney said back in June 2016.

{"original": "Congress and U.S. intelligence agencies are scrutinizing connections between Russia and the Trump campaign as they investigate evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.

The report was based largely on the work done by Brennan's task force.\\n\\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence releases a declassified report that concludes Russia was behind the campaign hacking -- information that Brennan brought to Obama in August.\\n\\nTrump writes on Twitter: Julian Assange said 'a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta' - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!\\n\\nIn a tweet, Trump says it's very strange that an intelligence briefing on Russia hacking was delayed until Friday, perhaps so a better case could be built. Officials say there was no such delay.\\n\\nBefore he left office, Obama set in motion a secret program that authorized the deployment of implants in Russian networks – digital bombs that could be triggered in a retaliatory cyber-strike in the event of Moscow aggression. It would be up to President Trump to decide whether to use the capability.\\n\\nIn a tweet, Trump praises Putin's decision not to respond to the U.S. sanctions.\\n\\nIn a surprising move, Putin chooses not to retaliate against the sanctions imposed by Obama.\\n\\nFlynn discusses the sanctions over the phone withKislyak, a conversation that gets picked up by U.S. intelligence agencies.\\n\\nThe FBI put priority on seizing the Russian compounds in Maryland and New York as a response to the election interference. Aerial images of the facilities showed how the compounds were modified, presumably to enhance their espionage capabilities. When the Russians evacuated the compounds, they stripped them of antennas, electronics, computers, file cabinets and other gear, officials said.\\n\\nThe list of expelled spies in retaliation for Russia's election interference included several who were suspected of helping the operation from within the United States, officials said. The roster focused heavily on Russians with technical skills.\\n\\nThe administration orders new sanctions against Russian organizations and individuals in response to Russian interference in the election. The administration also orders 35 Russian suspected spies operating under diplomatic cover to leave the United States and closes Russian-owned facilities on Maryland's Eastern Shore and on Long Island that are believed to be used for intelligence purposes.\\n\\nWhen asked about election tampering at his resort in Mar-a-Lago,Trump says it's time for the country to move on to bigger and better things.\\n\\nThe CrowdStrike cybersecurity firm says it has high confidence that the group that hacked the DNC has ties to the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU.\\n\\nObama gives one of his last news conferences, expressing irritation that the media had been obsessed with the WikiLeaks disclosures.

It was like a funeral parlor, said one official.\\n\\nJust before the election, the FBI concludes there is no evidence of wrongdoing in the newly discovered Clinton emails.\\n\\nKerry proposed the creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate Russian interference and make recommendations on how to protect future elections. Obama and senior White House officials killed the idea. They believed it would be blocked by Congress and be perceived as partisan.\\n\\nKerry makes one last try to confront Russia by advocating for a bipartisan commission.\\n\\nThe administration delivers a final pre-election message to Moscow, warning that Russian meddling would be regarded as unacceptable interference.

No puppet. You're the puppet. When moderator Chris Wallace asks Trump whether he condems Russian interference, he responds: Of course I condemn. I don't know Putin. I have no idea.\\n\\nClinton says Putin supports Trump because he would rather have a puppet as president of the United States.\\n\\nStone claims that he communicated with Assange through a backchannel and that he's never spoken with him directly.

[Clinton] doesn't know if it's the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking, he says.\\n\\nClinton accuses Trump of benefiting from Russia's election meddling. Trump denies it, saying he doesn't know Putin.\\n\\nThis is the administration's first public comment. Until now, the Obama administration had avoided publicly blaming the Kremlin. Obama was facing pressure from the Clinton campaign, his party and his administration to issue some sort of statement summarizing its findings. Comey and Obama do not sign the document, to avoid any appearance of politics.\\n\\nAt 4:30 p.m., WikiLeaks begins publishing hacked emails from Podesta's account.

It makes no mention of Russia.\\n\\nMeanwhile, foreign policy adviser Page steps down from the Trump campaign.\\n\\nConservative Republicans are soured by Trump's first debate performance.

But the intelligence community has still not reached consensus on Putin's role and intentions.\\n\\nTrump tells Larry King on a show airing on the Kremlin-backed RT that it is probably unlikely Russia was behind the election interference. I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out. Who knows? But I think that it's pretty unlikely, Trump says.\\n\\nSessions meets with Kislyak in his Senate office and later said he took the meeting as a member of the Armed Services Committee, not as a Trump campaign official. The encounter with the Russian ambassador is one of two that Sessions fails to disclose during his confirmation hearing for attorney general.\\n\\nBrennan finally finishes briefing all of the Gang of Eight congressional leaders.

Putin also speculates that the hacking was perhaps a public good. The Clinton campaign denounces his comments, saying that Putin is endorsing election interference.\\n\\nThe FBI releases documents on Clinton's emails. They show Clinton and her staff used an informal way to exchange sensitive information, but otherwise the release is devoid of any major revelations.\\n\\nCongressional leaders are briefed on threats to elections systems by Comey and White House homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco, but the meeting dissolves into partisan bickering.

A Department of Homeland Security official said there was one state in which there was evidence voting systems were compromised: Illinois.\\n\\nStone tweets: Trust me, it will soon the Podesta's time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary.

{"original": "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) this week became one of the latest to adopt the strategy, signing an executive order that effectively forces Internet service providers (ISPs) that do business with the state to abide by strong net neutrality rules.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRather than directly regulating the broadband industry, the executive order imposes procurement obligations on state agencies. Under the order, state officials contracting with ISPs for service may do so only if the providers agree not to block or slow websites, or to offer websites faster delivery to consumers in exchange for an extra fee.\\n\\nAs a large consumer of Internet service, said Murphy, the state may be able to pressure ISPs into granting New Jersey residents the same equal-access protections afforded to the government.\\n\\nWhile New Jersey cannot unilaterally regulate net neutrality back into law or cement it as a state regulation, Murphy said, we can exercise our power as a consumer to make our preferences known.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe decision comes weeks after Montana and New York officials signed virtually identical orders. The state of Hawaii this week also joined the group.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe orders could contradict the FCC's new rules on net neutrality, which claim to preempt any state or local requirements that are inconsistent with the agency's deregulatory agenda. (The FCC declined to comment.) But whether a court will agree with the FCC's approach is unclear. The debate over net neutrality is headed into uncharted waters, analysts say.\\n\\nI really don't know how the state spending case would turn out, said Berin Szoka, president of the right-leaning think tank TechFreedom. We've been looking into it. There isn't much case law to look to as precedent. It will be a fascinating case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the heart of a legal fight over the executive orders will be familiar constitutional questions — and some novel ones. Since the country's founding, legal experts have clashed over where the federal government's authority ends and state authority begins. From a basic perspective, the FCC enjoys the upper hand: Part of its reason for existence is to smooth over differences in state laws, said Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe overall case law supports the FCC in maintaining a consistent and coherent national policy for an interstate industry, Turley said. The states have a considerable burden to overcome.\\n\\nBut despite the supremacy of the federal government in most matters, states still have broad leeway within their borders, other experts say.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe states' power to buy goods and services has nothing to do with the federal government, said Andrew Schwartzman, a public interest lawyer at Georgetown University.\\n\\nStates are also allowed some regulatory flexibility even on certain matters that indirectly touch interstate commerce — a traditionally federal issue. For example, states can regulate car dealerships and supermarkets, even though the goods they sell may cross state borders, according to Harold Feld, senior vice president of the consumer group Public Knowledge.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFeld added that there is precedent for states using their purchasing power to advance social goals. For example, he said, Maryland has used its state contracting rules to effectively raise wages in the state.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, states may face other obstacles in implementing their executive orders, even if the orders are taken to court and survive. For example, ISPs could simply decide that they are willing to lose the state's business over re-engineering their traffic policies.\\n\\nSome state officials acknowledge that possibility.\\n\\nNothing stops ISPs from selling dumpy Internet plans in Montana if they insist, Montana officials stated in a fact sheet on their executive order.\\n\\nStates are betting that most ISPs will fall in line rather than risk giving up a major customer. But it's a dangerous game that could end up with all of a market's ISPs essentially calling the state's bluff — leaving the government without any broadband provider, said Dan Lyons, a law professor at Boston College. And the move could even wind up costing state governments more money."}

Call the cops!\\n\\nHelp us, another passenger pleaded. We are waiting in line for hours.\\n\\nBefore the encounter, passengers had sat on the tarmac for about two hours. The crew, a passenger said, had told them they were having difficulty closing the latch on the plane's luggage compartment. The airline said the weather conditions were so bad — just after the bomb cyclone had battered the Northeast with snow, ice and frigid cold — that one of the aircraft's doors froze and could not be fixed in time before the crew exhausted its regulated duty day limits.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPassengers were deplaned. Another two hours later, at the gate, and in line to get information about their way out of Boston, passengers grew frustrated, Kira Wegler said. Some did what many air travelers do these days.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPeople started pulling out their phones, recalls Wegler, who kept filming after the directive to stop. People wanted to document their experience and the (airline) personnel threatened to call the police and security and have us arrested.

Restrictions include filming of equipment monitors that are shielded from public view.\\n\\nIn a statement, Porter Airlines apologized to the passengers, acknowledging the airline worker was wrong to ask passengers to stop filming and to delete footage. But the request was made only with the intention to try and enforce what was believed to be an airport policy, the statement said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn this particular case, there was a misunderstanding by the team member involved that taking video beyond the security checkpoint was part of the secure area and was not permitted, the airline said. He did not realize the distinction at the time, but we have advised the team members involved for future reference.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPorter disputes passengers' assertions that its representative threatened to have passengers arrested.\\n\\nWhile it was indicated at the time that police based at the airport could be called to address this situation, there was no direct statement that passengers would be arrested, the airline said.\\n\\nFlight 948 was carrying 74 passengers and scheduled to depart Boston for Toronto around 5:30 p.m. Friday. Passengers were rescheduled to fly out Monday, the airline confirmed. According to the Toronto-based regional carrier, the flight was complicated by the weather conditions in Boston. Hundreds of flights had been canceled and delayed Friday, a day after the major winter storm.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut no weather conditions justify misleading passengers on a policy that doesn't exist, passengers and experts said.\\n\\nIt is clear that in this instance the airline employees overstepped their bounds, said Douglas Kidd, an advocate with the National Association of Airline Passengers. He said the group is also concerned that airlines might be blaming weather for a mechanical problem to avoid compensating passengers.\\n\\nAirlines might be unreasonably blaming weather as the cause of flight cancellations, when in fact mechanical issue or other internal issues are to blame.\\n\\nThat's an important distinction, Kidd said, because passengers are compensated in the event of mechanical issues but not when a cancellation is due to weather.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs far as filming in airports, he said: Photography is not a crime, but passengers should be wary of unnecessarily antagonizing security and airport personnel. Know and follow TSA and airport guidelines when you photograph and make audio and video recordings. Be discreet.

{"original": "More than most potential candidates for the president, Warren seemed to be ready for the brickbats. The senator from Massachusetts is the first high-profile Democratic contender, with preexisting grass-roots support, a national fundraising network and credible poll numbers in early-voting states. Four years ago, Warren rejected a campaign to draft her into the presidential primary; since then, she has grown more influential in the party, introducing bills that would give workers more control of corporations, shrink the influence of lobbyists and turn the federal government into a generic-drug manufacturer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren's also the first 2020 contender with a serious army of political enemies, most of them on the right, who have spent much of the past decade trying to stop her rise. It's not easy to be Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), who has toiled to raise awareness of his presidential campaign since July 2017. But he's been able to do so without Republicans sending trackers, filing requests for public information and asking for ethics investigations. Warren's most controversial decision of 2018 — to take a DNA test and release the results — was spurred by six years of questions about why she once identified as Native American.\\n\\nWarren's announcement can be fairly seen as the start of the 2020 Democratic primary. The question for Democratic voters is whom to nominate; the question for the press is whether we've learned anything from a 2016 campaign that made fools out of many experts. Plenty of first-look commentary on Warren is repeating the mistake that led many to suggest that Donald Trump could not win the 2016 Republican nomination, or that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would be, at best, a token challenger for Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nSo, we don't know who's going to win this thing. But we have a better idea of what is and isn't going to matter when Democrats start piling in.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFirst, the party in power is not great at guessing whom it should run against. It's an open secret that Republicans consider Warren to be the weakest top-tier Democratic candidate. The arguments for that run from the sensible (President Trump has defined her effectively as Pocahontas) to the fanciful (she's a female baby boomer and Trump already beat one of those). Early polling backs some of this up; Quinnipiac's pre-Christmas survey found that 37 percent of voters already viewed Warren negatively, more than any other Democrat.\\n\\nThat would be compelling if not for two small details: Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Both entered their primaries as underdogs seen by the other party's front-runners as beatable. In Trump's case, Democrats were literally rooting for him to succeed; a memo published after the hack of Clinton campaign emails revealed that the Democratic front-runner wanted far-right candidates such as Trump to serve as Pied Pipers, serenading the rest of their party off a cliff.\\n\\nWe need to be elevating the Pied Piper candidates so that they are leaders of the pack and tell the press to [take] them seriously, the campaign wrote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat email was sent in April 2015. One month later, a Quinnipiac poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 18 points.\\n\\nSecond, the establishment isn't operating the way it used to. One of the great paradoxes of the last Democratic primary season is that the forces that lost — supporters of Sanders — routed the forces that won. For more than a year, they fought for, and won, changes to the Democratic primary rules that eliminated the voting power of superdelegates on the first ballot at any convention. At the same time, they won commitments from the Democratic National Committee that set up earlier debates and prioritized candidates with grassroots fundraising. The rules that infuriated Sanders supporters in 2016, allowing Clinton to build a huge delegate lead before facing her opponents, have been overturned.\\n\\nBut the party is not behaving the way it did in 2016. By this point in the previous cycle, 63 Democratic members of Congress had already endorsed Clinton, who was months away from announcing her campaign. As of right now, no Democratic member of Congress has endorsed a potential presidential candidate. The idea of candidates jumping in to prevent a rallying effect for someone else is, for now, defunct, and the results in 2016 (such as Sanders's landslide win in New Hampshire) cut against the idea that endorsements from prominent Democrats can move votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat don't we know? Well, for the first time since 2004, Democrats have a wide-open primary field with no establishment favorite, and not much of an establishment to decide on one. The 2008 and 2016 primaries eventually settled into battles between Clinton, representing the old party leadership, and a candidate who could define himself as a change agent. Some Democrats see Joe Biden potentially filling that establishment role, but none see him consolidating party support the way Clinton did.\\n\\nThird, the two parties' voters are different. The most interesting aspect of Warren's launch video was how it diverged from the messaging of every recent Democratic nominee for president. In 2016, Republicans got behind a candidate who argued that there was no compromise with the political class and that a strong leader was needed to dismantle it. Democrats have generally argued that good people can differ and unite against the minority of special interests keeping the government from answering voters' needs.\\n\\nWhat's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics — the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems, Obama said in the first speech of his 2008 campaign.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarren's first message to voters is different, identifying the economic anxieties of voters and then immediately assigning blame. These aren't cracks families are falling into — they're traps, she says in her launch video. America's middle class is under attack. How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a bigger slice.\\n\\nLike Sanders, who may end up joining the race, Warren simply does not use the language of compromise or national unity; she uses the language of resistance. As they pile into the race, some Democrats will find themselves arguing for a return to the less divisive politics of the pre-Trump era, while others, such as Warren, will call for a president to dismantle the financial forces that made Trump's win possible. To those in the latter camp, Trump never could have won had he not been able to define himself as a blue-collar billionaire against Clinton's Wall Street supporters; for them, in 2020, the job will be giving him an opponent who can make a populist case against him.\\n\\nWhat we don't know is how much Democratic voters crave that. For a very long time, Democratic voters told pollsters that they wanted leaders who could compromise with the other party. From 2017 to 2018, according to Pew Research, the proportion of Democrats saying that fell from 69 percent to 46 percent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat's still a substantial bloc of voters, and in interviews with Iowa Democrats last month, The Post found plenty of them worrying that a divisive candidate could not win the presidency. The forces that ended up giving the Republican nomination to Trump do not exist on the left. What is motivating Democratic voters? Thanks to Warren, we'll find out pretty soon.\\n\\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\\n\\nWhat will the left do? There has been a clamor for Elizabeth Warren to run for president since the day she arrived in the Senate. Now that she's in, some of the first notes of skepticism came from people who had pined for her to do this four years ago. The reason: The left found a champion in 2016, and few people who consider themselves part of the left want to see Warren face off against Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nIf Bernie does or doesn't get in, my concern is whether the progressive vote splits up and we have the same kind of nominee we had last time, said one early-state operative who was still deciding which candidate to work for. It would be great to have one strong, progressive voice. It's not going to happen.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's plenty of overlap between Warren and Sanders on policy, and both are likely to get rounded into one of the press's lanes or tiers as the left's potential candidate. But one of the most interesting debates inside the Democratic Party right now is between Sanders's democratic socialism and Warren's reformed progressivism. By doing so well in 2016, Sanders exploded the popularity of a political philosophy that had been sidelined in the United States for 100 years; Warren hasn't had the same platform to spell out what she stands for.\\n\\nOne of the best elucidations of the two politicians' differences came last year from David Dayen, who's set to become the editor of the liberal magazine the American Prospect. Warren, wrote Dayen, wants to make capitalism work for everyone, while Sanders does not think it can.\\n\\nYou can restructure markets so everyone benefits, or you can break down the market system, either eliminating the profit motive or giving everybody a public option, Dayen wrote. The impulse is the same: The game is rigged and must be fixed. But there's a long gap between re-writing the rules of the game, as Warren wants, and turning over all the chess pieces, as Sanders does.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJacobin founder Bhaskar Sunkara, who (as noted above) was skeptical that Warren could win her state's primary, has warned that socialists can't depend on her to deliver systemic change. Sanders's politics grew out of the fading socialist movement; Warren's grew out of research into bankruptcy.\\n\\nShe'll have the problems Sanders had early on in 2015, and I don't see her catching fire, Sunkara said.\\n\\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\\n\\nDemocrats now expect Rep. Nancy Pelosi to become the next speaker of the House after she put down several small rebellions by centrists. But at least one House Democrat is already facing a primary challenge over her refusal to back Pelosi (D-Calif.), and at least nine more are being looked over by left-wing groups that want to continue moving the party in their direction.\\n\\nNew York activist Siela Bynoe is considering a challenge to Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.), one of Pelosi's most persistent critics, and her supporters are circulating a poll that suggested the Pelosi issue could make Rice vulnerable. While Rice's personal approval rating in her Long Island district was 70 percent — higher than Pelosi's — the pollster found a slight majority of Democrats open to opposing Rice once informed that she opposed the Democratic leader.\\n\\nKathleen Rice has fatally misjudged Democrats in her district, said Evan Roth Smith of Slingshot Strategies, which conducted the poll. Sixty-five percent of primary voters want to see unity among Democrats, and less than half say they're likely to vote for Rice again after her opposition to Pelosi. Rice may think she's taking a principled stand, but primary voters see it as craven political grandstanding and are punishing her accordingly.\\n\\nRice's 4th District is not quite as blue as the typical Democratic primary battlefield. Republican candidates for president regularly win around 44 percent of its vote, more than double their support in Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 14th District. But Sean McElwee of Data for Progress is conducting polls in 10 districts, a mixture of places where moderate incumbent Democrats represent much more liberal electorates and places where certain votes or issues could create an opening for a challenger.\\n\\n2020\\n\\nBernie Sanders. Dozens of veterans from his 2016 campaign are seeking a meeting on sexual harassment policy — a meeting that broke into public view thanks to Alex Thompson at Politico.\\n\\nMichael Bloomberg. The billionaire said on Meet the Press that he'll make a decision on a 2020 run in January or February and that any serious candidate needs to focus on climate change.\\n\\nTerry McAuliffe. The former Virginia governor told CNN that he is obviously looking at a presidential bid, then distinguished his support for universal health care from the versions endorsed by liberal Democratic senators: We have to actually pay for what we're actually promising.\\n\\nElizabeth Warren. She's en route to Iowa for the first time in years, barring any complications with the Senate's schedule. A tentative itinerary reviewed by The Post has her in Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Storm Lake and Des Moines.\\n\\nREADING LIST\\n\\nHow Elizabeth Warren is courting black voters and their leaders, by Annie Linskey\\n\\nCan a candidate like Warren break through in a race with a credible, female black candidate?

{"original": "Under the concept of disparate impact, actions can amount to discrimination if they have an uneven effect even if that was not the intent, and rolling back this approach has been a longtime goal of conservative legal thinkers. Past Republican administrations have done little to erode the concept's application, partly out of concerns that the Supreme Court might disagree, or that such changes would be unpopular and viewed as racist.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCivil rights advocates said diminishing this tool could have sweeping consequences.\\n\\nDisparate impact is a bedrock principle, said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Through the courts, we've been able to marshal data and use the disparate-impact doctrine as a robust tool for ferreting out discrimination.\\n\\nIn New York, a lawsuit alleges that a large apartment complex in Queens will not rent to anyone with a criminal record, and that this has the effect of discriminating against African American and Latino renters. The suit is pending, relying on disparate impact to make the case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Maryland, civil rights groups complained to the federal government after the state shifted transportation money from a light-rail project that would have helped mostly African American residents of Baltimore. The money instead went to bridge and road projects that served mostly white residents elsewhere in the state. A Transportation Department investigation into the matter was closed this summer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn education, the Obama administration reached settlements with school systems such as the one in Lodi, Calif., where an investigation found widespread disparities in student discipline. African American students, for instance, were five times as likely as white peers to receive out-of-school suspensions for willful defiance or disruption.\\n\\nIn 2014, the Obama administration formally advised school systems they may be guilty of racial discrimination if students of color are punished at higher rates.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen investigators and courts incorporate disparate impact in a review, they are looking at more than the intent of laws or practices. They are also evaluating whether a policy's impact varies based on race, ethnicity or other factors. Regulations across the government implementing the 1964 Civil Rights Act and its amendments define discrimination as including this unintentional form of bias.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump administration signaled its hostility to this approach in a report issued last month by the Federal Commission on School Safety, which recommended rescinding the school discipline guidance. In a sharply worded and controversial chapter, the report said the validity of disparate impact analysis cannot be squared with the Supreme Court's holdings. The administration revoked the guidance a few days later.\\n\\nDisparate impact was written into the original regulations that implemented Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination based on race, color or national origin by entities, including schools, that receive federal funding. The school safety report argued that earlier administrations had adopted the concept without regard for what the underlying statute said. It said that interpretation was of questionable validity and dubious, at best.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne person familiar with the administration's planning said the strong language in the school safety panel's report really signals the direction that the administration is going in. To that end, the Education Department is considering replacing the original Title VI regulation, this person said. He and others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe internal discussions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne option under consideration includes clarifying the Title VI regulation to make its use consistent with the Trump administration's legal views. Another option would replace the regulation with a new one, which would require a formal and lengthy process of public notice and comment.\\n\\nThose options are separate from the Justice Department memo, which was described by a person familiar with the document as a starting point for moving toward removing disparate-impact-based regulations across the federal government.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn June, the Department of Housing and Urban Development published a notice announcing that it plans to consider revising its 2013 regulation on disparate-impact claims in the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, religion and other factors in sale, rental or financing of housing. The agency signaled that it was reconsidering how the regulations affect the insurance industry, which has challenged them in court.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nData showing that a policy resulted in uneven consequences is not sufficient to prove a discrimination claim. A school or other institution accused of discrimination under the concept of disparate impact can defend itself by showing the policy is justified and that no other method exists to accomplish a goal.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has recognized disparate-impact claims, but in a 2015 housing case, its use was upheld by a narrow 5-to-4 vote, in an opinion written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, now retired. Some conservatives have speculated that the new court, with Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in Kennedy's place, might decide the same matter differently.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMuch — but not all — of the disparate-impact law could be changed by the administration because the concept was incorporated through regulations, which administrations are free to change by following a formal process. A broad-based rewrite of regulations could affect areas such as transportation and environmental law, as well as education and housing. But it would be harder to make changes to voting and employment law, experts say, because the concept of disparate impact is overtly written into the underlying statute, not just the regulations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSupporters of disparate-impact analysis say it is a critical tool because finding smoking gun evidence to prove someone intended to discriminate is difficult. And even if the intention wasn't to discriminate, advocates say institutions should be held accountable for discriminatory effects.\\n\\nMost people don't have access to what's going on in somebody's mind. Even if a decision was intentionally discriminatory, it's going to be very difficult to prove, said Ajmel Quereshi, senior counsel with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut conservatives have long argued that proving discrimination should require proof that someone intended to treat people differently. And they say that if people are being judged by numbers, they may feel pressure to make decisions based on racial quotas.\\n\\nThe disparate-impact approach requires decision-makers to make decisions with an eye on race. That is exactly what the civil rights laws are supposed to prohibit, said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank focused on race and ethnicity. He said he has lobbied Trump administration officials to write the idea out of federal regulations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDisparate-impact analysis, he argued, is not necessary to combat true discrimination. He said he also tried to persuade officials in the George W. Bush administration to do the same, without results. The Bushes were very skittish on civil rights issues, he said."}

(LAUGHTER) And for those of you who don't, I hope at least you take Jackie's position as your own and give me a chance to tell you what's on my heart. (APPLAUSE) I recognize the history of the Republican Party and the NAACP has not been one of regular partnership. But our nation is harmed when we let our differences separate us and divide us. So while some in my party have avoided the NAACP, and while some in the NAACP have avoided my party... (LAUGHTER) ... I'm proud to be here. I'm proud to be here. (APPLAUSE) I'm here--I'm here because I believe there's so much that we can do together to advance racial harmony and economic opportunity. Before we go to the future, we must acknowledge our past. In the darkest days of the Civil War, President Lincoln pleaded to our divided nation to remember that we cannot escape history, that we will be remembered in spite of ourselves. One hundred and forty years later, that's still true. For our nation, there is no denying the truth that slavery is a blight on our history and that racism, despite all the progress, still exists today. For my party, there is no escaping the reality that the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln. Recognizing and confronting our history is important. Transcending our history is essential. We're not limited by what we have done or what we have left undone. We're limited only by what we're willing to do. (APPLAUSE) Our nation must make new a commitment to equality and upward mobility to all of the citizens. This is a great moment of national prosperity, but many still live in prosperity's shadow. The same economy that is a miracle for millions is a mystery to millions as well. From the beginning of this campaign, I have said that prosperity must have a purpose. The purpose of prosperity is to ensure the American dream touches every willing heart. And we cannot afford to have an America segregated by class, by race, or by aspiration. America must close the gap of hope between communities of prosperity and communities of poverty. We have seen what happens--we've seen what happens when African-American citizens have the opportunity they've earned and the respect that they deserve. Men and women once victimized by Jim Crow have risen to leadership in the halls of Congress. (APPLAUSE) Professionals and entrepreneurs have built a successful and growing and ever stronger African-American middle class. It must be our goal to expand this opportunity, to make it as broad and diverse as America its success--America itself. And this begins by enforcing the civil rights laws. (APPLAUSE) Discrimination is still a reality, even when it takes different forms. Instead of Jim Crow, there's racial redlining and profiling. Instead of separate but equal, there is separate and forgotten. Strong civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my administration. (APPLAUSE) And I will confront another form of bias: the soft bigotry of low expectations. (APPLAUSE) Several months ago I visited Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, where African-Americans confronted injustice and white Americans confronted their conscience. In 43 years, we have come so far in opening the doors of our schools. But today we have a challenge of our own. While all can enter our schools, many--too many, are not learning there. There's a tremendous gap of achievement between rich and poor, white and minority. This, too, leaves a divided society. And whatever the causes, the effect is discrimination. My friend Phyllis Hunter (ph), of Houston, Texas, calls reading the new civil right. Equality in our country will remain a distant dream until every child, of every background, learns so that he or she may strive and rise in this world. No child in America should be segregated by low expectations, imprisoned by illiteracy, abandoned to frustration and the darkness of self-doubt. (APPLAUSE) There's reason for optimism in this land. A great movement of education reform has begun in this country built on clear principles: to raise the bar of standards, expect every child can learn; to give schools the flexibility to meet those standards; to measure progress and insist upon results; to blow the whistle on failure; to provide parents with options to increase their option, like charters and choice; and also remember the role of education is to leave no child behind. I believe in these principles, and I've seen them work; I've seen them turn around troubled schools in my state, schools labeled by the world at-risk. At-risk means you're not supposed to learn, but we've challenged that in the state of Texas. I've seen these schools and principles bring new hope, inspiring new confidences and ambitions. And I'm especially proud, in my state, that we're improve--our minority students are improving faster than almost any other state in the union. And I am especially proud of this fact: that African-American fourth graders in the state of Texas have better math skills than any other students--African-American students in any state in the United States of America. (APPLAUSE) And we can make this progress at the national level. A central part of my agenda, for example, is to challenge and change Title 1, to make sure we close the achievement gap, to make sure that children are not forgotten and simply shuffled through the system. Under my vision, all students must be measured. We must test to know. And low-performing schools, those schools that won't teach and won't change, will have three years to produce results, three years to meet standards, three years to make sure the very faces of our future are not mired in mediocrity. And if they're able to do so, the resources must go to the parents so that parents can make a different choice. You see, no child--no child should be left behind in America. (APPLAUSE) See every child can learn. Every child can learn. And every child in this country deserves to grow in knowledge and character and ideals. Nothing in my view is more important to our prosperity and goodness than cultivated minds and courageous hearts. As W.E.B. Du Bois said a century ago, Either the United States will destroy ignorance or ignorance will destroy the United States. Education is the essential beginning, but we've got to go further. To create communities of promise, we must help people build the confidence and faith to achieve their own dreams. We must put government squarely on the side of opportunity. There's a higher and older tradition in my party. Lincoln argued that every poor man should have a chance. He defended a clear path for all. He financed colleges and welcomed immigrants, promoted railroads and economic development. Through the Homestead Act, he gave countless Americans a piece of land for a start in a life. I propose a new prosperity initiative that reflects the spirit of Lincoln's reforms, a plan to remove obstacles on the road to the middle class. You see, instead of helping people cope with their need, we will help them move beyond it. And here's some of the ideas of the new prosperity initiative--just some of the thoughts. We must provide a family health credit that covers 90 percent of the cost of basic health policy for low-income families. We must make it possible for more people to become homeowners in this great land, to own a part of the American dream. We would allow low-income families to use up to a year's worth of Section 8 rental payments to make a down-payment on their own home, then use five years of those payments to help with the mortgage. (APPLAUSE) We'll start an American dream down-payment fund, matching individual savings to the down-payment for a home. Behind these last two proposals is a simple belief: I believe in private property. I believe in private property so strongly I want everybody to have some. (APPLAUSE) Education helps the young. Empowerment lifts the able. But there are those who need much more: children without role models; young people captured by gangs, addiction or despair. Government can spend money, but it cannot put hope in someone's heart or a sense of purpose in someone's life. This is done by caring communities, by churches and charities that serve their neighbors because they love their god. Every day they prove that our worst problems are not hopeless or endless. Every day they perform miracles of renewal. What we need is a new attitude that welcomes the transforming power of faith. In the words of a writer who visited the Mount Haven (ph) section of Bronx, ``The beautiful old stone church is a gentle sanctuary from the terror of the streets outside.'' In city after city, for the suffering and hurting, the most powerful passageway is the door of the house of God. We're going to extend the role and reach of charities and churches and synagogues and mosques, mentors and community healers in our society. As president, I will rally the armies of compassion in neighborhoods all across America. I'll lift the regulations that hamper private and faith-based programs. I'll involve them in after-school programs and maternity group homes, drug treatment programs and prison ministries. And I have laid out specific incentives to encourage an outpouring of giving in America. Here's one example: More than 1 million children have one or both parents in prison. These are the forgotten children, almost six times more likely to go to prison themselves. And they should not be punished for the sins of their fathers. We should give grants to ministries and mentoring programs that offer support and love and concern for these children. Let us bring hope and help to these other innocent victims of crime. I'm not calling for government to step back from its responsibilities, but to share in them. We'll always need government to raise and distribute funds, to monitor success and set standards. But we also need what no government can provide, the power of compassion and prayer and love. (APPLAUSE) These are some of my goals for America to help make opportunity not only a hope and a promise, but a living reality. The NAACP and the GOP have not always been allies. I know that. But recognizing our past and confronting the future with a common vision, by doing that, I believe we can find common ground. It won't be easy work, but a philosopher once advised, when given a choice, prefer the hard. We will prefer the hard, because only the hard will achieve the good. That's my commitment, and that is our opportunity. Thank you for having me, and God bless America.\\n\\n© 2000 The Washington Post Company\\n\\nFront | Political News | Elections | The Issues | Federal Page | Polls\\n\\nColumns - Cartoons | Live Online | Online Extras | Photo Galleries | Video - Audio"}
{"original": "And if I were an adversary, I would be welcoming this turn of events. This trend of refusing to accept free and fair elections, without any proof of fraud, must end for the sake of our democratic republic.\\n\\nWhat we are witnessing now is the latest in a chain of unfounded questions about the legitimacy of our elections that has gone well beyond rooting out irregularities in voting. It began in 2005, when then-Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) led a charge to overturn Ohio's vote in favor of George W. Bush. This impulse resumed in 2016, led by those who refused to accept Donald Trump's election. Now, it has reached its apex, with the president and some of his supporters questioning the 2020 election without proof, only conspiracy and hearsay.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring a call that sounded more gangster than presidential, Trump called Georgia state officials, asking them to find more votes in his favor. The president and some in his party are refusing to accept the outcome of the election, instead sowing doubt and conspiracy. This was an election that multiple independent observers, the courts and both parties have found to be free and fair. To imply otherwise is self-serving and stokes further discord in our country.\\n\\nThe fact that all 10 living former secretaries of defense felt the need to sign on to an op-ed asking the military to refrain from interfering in the transition is incredible. This behavior from the administration is seen in Third World dictatorships, not the leading democracy in the world.\\n\\nThis needs to end. Our current challenges are too great. We must have a unified effort to tackle the problems we face.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOur adversaries are watching us closely. Russia and China, among others, will seize upon our internal divisions, using them to divide our allies. They are highlighting our current dysfunction in their own propaganda campaigns to claim that our democracy is in decline and our moral authority is waning. Our adversaries are busy fostering distrust of the United States and democracy, and we are handing them the ammunition. What are we doing?\\n\\nThe damage that is being done right now to our democracy and our international standing will not go away when President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. Our allies will question our commitments to our alliances and partnerships. The United States' pledges used to be automatic, beyond question. That level of certainty brought peace, stability and prosperity to millions across the globe for decades.\\n\\nThis is a defining moment in American politics. We can and should disagree about policies and about our country's direction. But refusing to recognize state-certified elections without evidence of fraud is an abdication of the higher responsibility to our Constitution. Elected officials who are engaging in this behavior must resist the urge of self-service, self-preservation and blind allegiance to a single person or party.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe have a way in this country to change the direction in which we are headed: elections. Instead of trying to undo one, we need to work to gain more support in the next. That is the democratic process. That is America, and it is what has made our country a beacon of freedom and hope for the oppressed around the world.\\n\\nI call on my former Republican colleagues to return to the business of governing. That's why they were elected. Our country is facing issues that demand solutions and cooperation, not more division, rhetoric and condescension. We must unite to address the immediate challenge of responding to covid-19 and managing its long-term impact, confront our exploding debt, compete with Russia and China, strengthen our economy and build for the future. We cannot solve any of these challenges if we are bickering among ourselves, battling unfounded conspiracy theories and allowing bitter partisan rancor to dominate sensible policy progress.\\n\\nThe election is over. Leadership isn't easy, but it is what the United States needs most right now.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "But she's also shown a tendency to exaggerate or misstate basic facts. And her defense of this in a Sunday interview with 60 Minutes was very bad.\\n\\nWhen Anderson Cooper confronted her with The Washington Post Fact Checker's Four-Pinocchio verdict on her claim about $21 trillion in waste at the Pentagon, Ocasio-Cortez offered this (emphasis added):\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCOOPER: One of the criticisms of you is that-- that your math is fuzzy. The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios -- OCASIO-CORTEZ: Oh my goodness -- COOPER: -- for misstating some statistics about Pentagon spending? OCASIO-CORTEZ: If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right. COOPER: But being factually correct is important-- OCASIO-CORTEZ: It's absolutely important. And whenever I make a mistake. I say, Okay, this was clumsy, and then I restate what my point was. But it's -- it's not the same thing as -- as the president lying about immigrants. It's not the same thing at all.\\n\\nThe first problem here is that Ocasio-Cortez is really minimizing her falsehoods. Four Pinocchios is not a claim that Glenn Kessler and The Post's Fact Checker team give out for bungling the semantics of something. It's when something is a blatant falsehood. It's the worst rating you can get for a singular claim.\\n\\nIn the case of the $21 trillion, Ocasio-Cortez was suggesting that this was all Pentagon waste and that cleaning it up could pay for two-thirds of the estimated $32 trillion price tag for single-payer health care, which she and others are referring to as Medicare-for-all.\\n\\n$21 TRILLION of Pentagon financial transactions 'could not be traced, documented, or explained,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote in a tweet that still appears on her timeline and has been shared more than 26,000 times. $21T in Pentagon accounting errors. Medicare for All costs ~$32T. That means 66% of Medicare for All could have been funded already by the Pentagon.\\n\\nBut that $21 trillion estimate isn't necessarily waste; it's just sloppily accounted for, according to that study. It's also not just money the Pentagon spends; it includes money coming into the Pentagon. And that $32 trillion price tag is an estimate for the first 10 years of Medicare-for-all, while the Pentagon number accounts for a 17-year period. Ocasio-Cortez's numbers weren't just wrong on the margins; her conclusion made no logical sense in light of the actual facts. What's more, this isn't the only claim she's made that has been debunked; The Post's team documented five false claims she made during an August media blitz following her primary upset of Rep. Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat might be most problematic about Ocasio-Cortez's defense, though, is the idea that people should care less about specific facts and more about being morally right — as if this is a zero-sum game in which the two can be weighed against one another. She's practically saying, Well, maybe I was wrong, but at least my cause is just.\\n\\nBut this is the slipperiest of slopes — the kind of attitude you can use to justify pretty much anything to yourself. And it also just so happens to be the underlying ethos of the entire Trump presidency.\\n\\nTrump has made more than 7,000 false claims as president, and to the extent his base of support processes those false claims, it has essentially dismissed them as unimportant in the scheme of things. Most recently, this has taken the form of saying or suggesting terrorists are flooding the U.S.-Mexico border, despite Trump's own State Department saying there is no evidence that even one has crossed. Trump's base would probably argue that this stat is nitpicking — that it's unimportant since his underlying goal to build the border wall and protect the American people is morally right. But the fact remains that this claim leads to a badly skewed sense of the actual dangers Americans face and could lead to a misplacement of priorities.\\n\\nAnd you can apply this approach to many of the biggest Trump falsehoods. If the ends justify the means and the policy is right, you can excuse pretty much anything.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNone of this is to compare Ocasio-Cortez's falsehoods to Trump's; she's right that there is no comparison. Trump's are both exponentially more numerous and more impactful, coming from the president of the United States. But just because something is worse doesn't mean something else can't be bad. People need to recognize that morally right is a subjective definition, and there need be no choice between making your case and using actual facts. Using exaggerated or made-up facts actually suggests your cause is weak — and that you haven't done your homework. If politicians misunderstand these very basic and crucial distinctions, how can we trust them to know what's best about the underlying policies? How much have you really studied this thing?"}
{"original": "On Monday, the Trump administration decided to hold an as-yet-unscheduled Principals Committee meeting on what do regarding $125 million of U.S. aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) that was scheduled to be delivered Jan. 1 but is now on hold. The meeting will include several Cabinet members, but all eyes will be on Haley, who has been leading the drive to cut the funding.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAccording to four administration officials who are involved in the debate, Haley has been pushing for a total cut in U.S. funding for UNRWA in response to the Palestinian Authority's actions following Trump's Dec. 6 announcement that the United States was officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. In late December, Haley said the Trump administration was taking names of those who voted for a resolution condemning the move.\\n\\nTrump tweeted Jan. 2 that unless the Palestinians return to peace negotiations, U.S. aid could be in jeopardy. Haley and Trump have talked several times about the issue, according to a senior administration official.\\n\\nThe president is fed up with this phenomena of trashing the United States at the U.N. and then asking us for money. Ambassador Haley shares that view, the official said. The process going forward is how to translate that presidential directive into actual policy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConcurrently, the Trump administration is holding aid to the Pakistani government until or unless that country does more to combat terrorist havens in its territory. That policy was also announced in a presidential tweet.\\n\\nThe UNRWA dispute is urgent because the organization, which supports schools and humanitarian facilities for refugees in Gaza, Jordan and the West Bank, is already in debt and facing a funding crisis if the money doesn't come through by the end of January. Inside the bureaucracy, Haley and Trump's actions on Palestinian funding have caused confusion and spurred backlash by officials at various agencies that deal with UNRWA, refugees and relations with allies, including Jordan. Several government officials told me that Haley's public and private actions on UNRWA funding have gone far beyond what has been agreed on in the interagency process.\\n\\nThose against totally cutting off U.S. funding for UNRWA argue that the tactic is unlikely to work. The Palestinians have shown no indication that they will make any concessions in response to U.S. pressure. Also, there is a classified U.S. government analysis that outlines the potential humanitarian cost of cutting aid to the refugees. The Jordanian government has expressed concern about the move, and even the Israeli government is not calling for a total cutoff of funds to UNRWA.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHaley is well-intentioned, but the practical effects of the position she has taken actually will do harm to the refugees, our ally in Jordan, and will leave the Israelis holding the bag when the s–t hits the fan, one State Department official said.\\n\\nTrump officials disputed reports that Haley had already been telling other U.N. member countries that the UNRWA aid is frozen, and another senior official told me that no final decisions have been made.\\n\\nBut three administration officials confirmed that at a Jan. 5 interagency meeting in Washington, representatives from the State and Defense departments argued for at least partial funding for UNRWA, while the representative from America's U.N. mission held firm to Haley's view that no funding should be provided. The decision is technically that of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has yet to personally weigh in. The upcoming Principals Committee meeting is meant to settle the dispute.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA State Department spokesman told me the administration is considering a range of options that take the peace process, humanitarian consequences and national security into consideration. Officials said one option is to give partial funding; another option is to ask others, such as Saudi Arabia, to foot the bill.\\n\\nSources close to Haley said she does not advocate abolishing UNRWA altogether, as some pro-Israel Republicans have long advocated. She simply believes that there can be no more business as usual when it comes to giving aid to countries that oppose U.S. policy. This position is shared by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Jared Kushner."}

Grab your forks and strap in.\\n\\nMarch 7, 2021, issue: A year ago, it was impossible to imagine how hard and long this pandemic would be. It feels like the world came to a stop. If or once things return to normal, I hope we know not to take simple things for granted. In the meantime, I can't wait for the stopwatch to be restarted.\\n\\nFeb. 28, 2021, issue: When lockdown started last year, many of us established hobbies to cope with boredom and loneliness.

Without their compassion, perseverance and sacrifice, I am nothing.\\n\\nFeb. 14, 2021, issue: This is a lighthearted look at Valentine's Day — juxtaposing love and intimacy with the holiday carnival that accompanies it. The lack of heaviness in the image felt like a nice change in these times.\\n\\nFeb. 7, 2021, issue: I wanted to mark the joyful occasion of dogs returning to the White House.

Now the real work begins.\\n\\n'Clean Sweep'\\n\\nJan. 10, 2021, issue: The time has come: In just a few days, President Donald Trump will have to pack up and leave, whether he likes it or not.

We became even more politically polarized — and then, as if to manifest this phenomenon, the coronavirus arrived, making it unsafe to physically connect.

Fall 2020 is all about face masks, flu shots and social distancing.\\n\\n'Trick or Treat'\\n\\nOct. 18, 2020, issue: I'm drawn to ideas surrounding our longing for and consumption of something at all costs — even when it is plainly bad for us, like these huge lollipops. Halloween actively magnifies this contradiction. Will the extra dimension of the coronavirus amplify our cravings even more, or will we give up? I wanted to convey our frustration with these desires.\\n\\n'The Vestibule'\\n\\nOct. 11, 2020, issue: I wanted the viewer to feel futility in the face of overwhelming destruction and devastation, since we've been hearing about — and, in large part, ignoring — the dire climate predictions for years. The title here comes from the first part of hell in Dante's 'Inferno': the vestibule, which is reserved for the indecisive.\\n\\n'Dogs of Fall'\\n\\nOct. 4, 2020, issue: As economies try to reopen during this pandemic, the most nerve-racking spaces will likely be those that are built to entertain large crowds: malls, museums, theme parks. For me, I'm eager to get back to an aquarium — where I can watch a manta ray flying through the water the whole afternoon. Will people continue to stay away? Or will we visit these places just as we did before?\\n\\n'Hanging On'\\n\\nSept. 27, 2020, issue: The race to develop a safe, accessible vaccine against covid-19 is on — and I'm already daydreaming about feeling lighthearted around loved ones and strangers again.\\n\\n'Back to School'\\n\\nSept. 20, 2020, issue: Even before the pandemic, many teachers had it rough, performing a hard job that often pays too little. Now it's even worse. Are we really going to force them to calculate the safest distance between their students? To burden them with making sure their classroom doesn't turn into the next hot spot? For their sakes, I'd prefer we tell everyone to stay home.\\n\\n'People-Powered'\\n\\nSept. 13, 2020, issue: Amidst a global pandemic and election season, we're asking U.S. Postal Service employees to be front-line workers, and we're depending on them to protect our democracy. We owe it to the Postal Service to defend it from privatization. Keeping it powered by, and for, its diverse workforce is a matter of racial and social justice.\\n\\n'The Summer That Never Was'\\n\\nSept. 6, 2020, issue: We've had no choice but to sit on the sidelines and watch summer pass by. Our vacations, concerts, weddings and barbecues were indefinitely postponed. Many people were puzzled- and baked-out by May. So a lot of us have spent our summer in front of the TV, living vicariously through our favorite shows.\\n\\n'Summer 2020'\\n\\nAug. 30, 2020, issue: Face masks are now part of our lives. It's a detail of the everyday, and the quirks that come with wearing one are proof of how casual it has become.\\n\\n'The Zoomers'\\n\\nAug. 23, 2020, issue: Since so much of what we learn in school is not from books, but in relationships with classmates and teachers, I can't help but wonder how remote schooling will affect this generation of teenagers. Who will they grow up to be: the manicured version of themselves presented online, or the socially rusty teenager hiding behind the screen?\\n\\n'(Conven)tion'\\n\\nAug. 9, 2020, issue: A convention without physically convening — hence the title — will feel a bit odd, but moving it to a virtual space during a pandemic is the obvious solution. Political conventions are such over-the-top spectacles, and it was a challenge to depict the atmosphere of an in-person gathering. With this image, I wanted to highlight the contrast between the teeming crowds vs. the socially distanced crowd on the screens.\\n\\n'Distractions'\\n\\nJuly 26, 2020, issue: The return of sports is meant to be a welcome distraction from this year's news, but if its reopening looks anything like our country's other reopenings, we're in for yet another disaster.\\n\\n'Dismantle. Rebuild.'\\n\\nJuly 19, 2020, issue: After centuries of inequity, violence and hate, we have a renewed chance to rebuild America. We all need to work to dismantle what has been so deeply ingrained in our country and our minds. It's time to reevaluate and re-create an America with stronger ideals and a safer infrastructure for everyone. The only way we can do this is by actively working together — every day.\\n\\n'Corona Holiday'\\n\\nJuly 12, 2020, issue: As economies try to reopen during this pandemic, the most nerve-racking spaces will likely be those that are built to entertain large crowds: malls, museums, theme parks. For me, I'm eager to get back to an aquarium — where I can watch a manta ray flying through the water the whole afternoon. Will people continue to stay away? Or will we visit these places just as we did before?\\n\\n'The Fourth of July'\\n\\nJune 28, 2020, issue: This Fourth of July, we can't let patriotic fervor push aside the message of Black Lives Matter. With civil unrest in the streets, the holiday has taken on a different feel. For years, I celebrated Independence Day at Coney Island before seemingly outgrowing it. But maybe 2020 is the year I'll go back — as we start America anew.\\n\\n'Our Stories'\\n\\nJune 21, 2020, issue: After the protests following the death of George Floyd, I looked through some old photographs of my family. I thought about all the stories my grandmother has told me about the protests in the '60s and the racism she has encountered. Who knew we'd have similar stories to tell today?\\n\\n'All-Inclusive Vacation'\\n\\nJune 14, 2020, issue: The pandemic has left many of us homebound, robbing us of a chance at a traditional summer getaway. Here, a person is still taking time off but is vacationing at home. The accessories — like what I would consider my dream umbrella — help with the illusion.\\n\\n'Summer in the Tidal Basin'\\n\\nJune 7, 2020, issue: When I hear stories of flora and fauna thriving among the absence of humans, I picture unthreatened, un-self-conscious animals taking advantage of summer in all the ways we've taken for granted and will be missing.\\n\\n'Zen Overload'\\n\\nMay 31, 2020, issue: We are all missing so much because of the pandemic. Still, I can't help but feel completely overwhelmed by the abundance of nice emails that it has brought, of group conversations with family, of chats with long-lost friends, of books to be read and podcasts to be heard, shows to watch and food to cook — all those lemons to squeeze in order to feel like I have made the most of this bad turn.\\n\\n'Calendar With Red, Yellow and Blue, 2020'\\n\\nMay 24, 2020, issue: Tying the idea of a calendar to recognizable nonrepresentational works of art, like Piet Mondrian's Composition and Tableau paintings, evokes the feeling of looking at something familiar, but not quite right.\\n\\n'Working Through the Lockdown'\\n\\nMay 17, 2020, issue: My studio is in an area with many self-employed artisans, ranging from boat builders to cabinet makers. The community is one of the reasons I work here, but right now they've all shut down due to lack of business. It's a bit lonely, and I feel guilty that I'm the only one still able to work.\\n\\n'Our New (Virtual) Reality'\\n\\nMay 10, 2020, issue: I'm starting to get the hang of living life online. At first it was difficult — I definitely devolved slightly during the first month of quarantine — but I've settled into a routine as time goes on. I've been keeping up with friends and family, working, teaching, exercising, grocery shopping and even dating — virtually.\\n\\n'Between the Lines'\\n\\nMay 3, 2020, issue: We're all battling an invisible enemy right now, one that visually manifests in the negative space between us: long lines in front of supermarkets, face masks and empty streets. The first time I saw a long line outside a store — an image that's always symbolized some kind of crisis — the pandemic suddenly became very real.\\n\\n'Small Bubble'\\n\\nApril 26, 2020, issue: My family is fortunate to be isolated together, but it has made work increasingly difficult. Like a lot of people, I feel that our bubble is a bit too small for all of us.\\n\\n'Drink Up'\\n\\nApril 19, 2020, issue: I wanted to illustrate the dire nature of our collective situation: that we see images of the destruction wrought by climate change all the time, and yet our world leaders do nothing. Here, a polar bear clings to a melting ice cube, and even though we know it's killing him, we still drink nonetheless.\\n\\n'House Party'\\n\\nApril 12, 2020, issue: There's a regular dance night here in New York with DJs and art installations. When the recent event was canceled because of the mandates about physical distancing, organizers announced a Zoom videoconference party instead. I love the idea of sharing a single soundtrack, being comfortable in your home environment and getting to be a little less self-conscious about your moves.\\n\\n'Soap Pusher'\\n\\nApril 5, 2020, issue: After a trip to the grocery store to see the barren shelves for myself, I thought about how fast something like hand sanitizer could, in our current dire situation, turn into an incredibly lucrative street product.\\n\\n'Let It Bubble'\\n\\nMarch 29, 2020, issue: Witnessing the cherry blossoms each spring is both a feast for the eyes and a grounding experience that connects us to the wonders of nature. Since the coronavirus pandemic has kept most of us from seeing them up close, here's a reminder that the blooms will eventually come again — and that hope is just around the corner.\\n\\n'Bracketology'\\n\\nMarch 22, 2020, issue: I started participating in March Madness bracket pools as a kid. I'd do all the necessary research (i.e., watching a lot of SportsCenter) — yet, inevitably, the winner would be someone who knew nothing about the sport. With this image, I wanted a literal interpretation of a bracket pool, complete with a smug winner surrounded by the carnage of upsets and buzzer-beaters, represented by the abandoned pool floats. Then, after the image went to press, the tournament was canceled as the coronavirus pandemic worsened. For me, this quickly put things in perspective. I feel awful for the players, especially the seniors who likely won't play college basketball again.\\n\\n'The Unlucky Irish'\\n\\nMarch 15, 2020, issue: Celebrating St. Patrick's Day (which is often used as an excuse to drink to excess) seems basically harmless, but I also question the stereotyping of an entire country — dressing up as a leprechaun with a funny red beard, etc. — and its history.\\n\\n'Don't Worry, I'll Be Back'\\n\\nMarch 8, 2020, issue: The era of peak TV has given us so many great shows, but it's almost too easy to live vicariously through them all. I'm trying to remind myself that I want to be more social and see my friends and family, live a real life, and feel my own emotions.\\n\\n'Holding Tight'\\n\\nMarch 1, 2020, issue: The idea for this piece was to illustrate the angst surrounding the Democratic Party and the candidates vying for a nomination for the presidency. Elections have always had maddening elements; add social media, the chaotic vote in Iowa and the normalization of boorish behavior, and you get a process that has become unpredictable and difficult to look away from.\\n\\n'Take a Leap, Day'\\n\\nFeb. 23, 2020, issue: When I think of leap day, I think of couples observing their anniversaries once every four years or elderly people celebrating their 21st birthdays. I wanted to go a less obvious route with this — a character who's frustrated because there's an extra day tacked on to what seems like an already very long year.\\n\\n'Winter Sleep'\\n\\nFeb. 16, 2020, issue: How to get comfy sleep during a nasty winter night: Get a good cup of tea, turn on a realistic number (20 to 30) of humidifiers to beat dry air, and cuddle up with piles of pillows and your pets. Voila! Good night.\\n\\n'Valentines'\\n\\nFeb. 9, 2020, issue: I wanted to create an enthusiastic depiction of solitude in the hope of counteracting the usual media and pop culture narrative around Valentine's Day — that love is only something shared between couples. People love all kinds of things, themselves included.\\n\\n'Once More Unto the Corn'\\n\\nFeb. 2, 2020, issue: My original idea for this illustration was purely geographical — presidential hopefuls among Iowa corn in advance of the caucuses. But it also works on another level: candidates emerging from a crowded field of contenders.\\n\\n'Resolve to Fail'\\n\\nJan. 26, 2020, issue: We make resolutions during the holiday period, when we have time to reflect. But once we're back to reality, life often thwarts our best intentions. This annual process is supposed to offer an opportunity for change, but often it results in tying ourselves to a new problem: useless guilt.\\n\\n(Illustration based on photo by Charles Kelly/Associated Press)\\n\\n'The Dreamer'\\n\\nJan. 19, 2020, issue: In this illustration, I depicted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. surrounded by multicolored clouds — I was inspired by 1960s-era aesthetics — that represent not only the ambition of his vision, but also the breadth of his societal influence. Since he stood for love and respect among all people, I wanted to use a warm palette, rather than the cool blue tones often used to portray him.\\n\\n'Exit Music'\\n\\nJan. 12, 2020, issue: Awards shows feel increasingly out of touch and irrelevant, especially in a world ruled by social media, where we can burrow into our niches. I wanted to compare the arenas of these competitions with the ruins of ancient Roman theaters and auditoriums, sites that are inextricably associated with the origins of Western theater.\\n\\n'Winter Walks'\\n\\nJan. 5, 2020, issue: I loved the idea of bundling up a pet and owner in matching outfits for the inevitable trek out in the snow, since I dread going outside in the winter — and so does my dog.\\n\\n'New Year's Sleep-Through'\\n\\nDec. 29, 2019, issue: The fantasy of New Year's Eve: a wild party where anything goes. The reality: falling asleep well before the clock strikes midnight.\\n\\n'Awkward Gratitude'\\n\\nDec. 15, 2019, issue: I wanted to illustrate the potentially awkward reactions people can have when getting gifts over the holidays. There's a lot of pressure when people come together to unpack presents — there are even online guides to help people react to gifts in the 'right' way. One year I gave everyone in my family homemade salted caramel, in the hopes of offering something personal rather than just buying presents … but I still have the feeling that nobody ate it.\\n\\n'Free the Weed'\\n\\nDecember 8, 2019, issue: There is growing momentum for breaking the cycle of criminality with regards to marijuana. It's a plant that's used in all sorts of other ways — ropemaking, for example. To many observers, criminalizing it seems increasingly absurd.\\n\\n'Capitol Exhalation'\\n\\nNov. 17, 2019, issue: I wanted to weave together one of D.C.'s iconic monuments with the Nationals' World Series win. Here, pitcher Daniel Hudson's victorious glove toss stands in for the Statue of Freedom on top of the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\n'Cacophony'\\n\\nNov. 10, 2019, issue: Politics often seems overly showy — composed of people bickering and behaving in a childish way. I think it's been detrimental to our image of politicians.\\n\\n'Memento Mori'\\n\\nOct. 27, 2019, issue: Besides the fun of both Halloween and the Day of the Dead, they're also good for us: In Western culture we tend to fear and ignore death, which only leads to a lack of preparation for what's inevitably to come. In a small — perhaps even unconscious — way, these holidays act as a modern-day memento mori, reminding us to enjoy life a bit more.\\n\\n'Columbus Syndrome'\\n\\nOct. 20, 2019, issue: One of the worst effects of gentrification is the displacement of a community with deep ties to a certain area or neighborhood. Often this displacement is made more painful by the incoming residents' lack of knowledge about the culture and history of a place: One can't 'discover' something that was already there. The character of a neighborhood suffers — until it looks, feels, smells and sounds homogeneous.\\n\\n'Dancing in October'\\n\\nOct. 13, 2019, issue: My favorite aspects of fall: getting to wear socks, harvesting apples at my parents', long walks along the river, colorful forests. It's one of the few times in the year — a short and precious period — when you can finally get dressed without worrying about sweating or freezing.\\n\\n'Back-to-Work Wear'\\n\\nOct. 6, 2019, issue: The Supreme Court reconvenes this week, which means that the justices' iconic robes are going back to work, too. I wanted the wire hangers to evoke maintenance and order; I also wanted to nod to the idea of service, with the famous dry cleaner's line: 'We love our customers.' \\n\\n'Pumpkin Spicezilla'\\n\\nSept. 29, 2019, issue: Behold: Pumpkin Spicezilla, the king of monsters, awakened each autumn and empowered by capitalism, sprinkling enormous amounts of pumpkin flavoring on lattes, soaps, lotion, candles — anything that comes his way. You'll smell it everywhere. There's no escape!\\n\\n'Early Onset Christmas'\\n\\nSept. 22, 2019, issue: Autumn is my favorite season — it's the best time to sit outside with my dog and a good book (or my sketchbook!). But my love of fall is tempered by how quickly it's overtaken by Christmas, with its egregious capitalism and oversaturation of absurdly tacky and invasive decorations. Aren't the beautiful fall leaves decorative enough?\\n\\n'Swipe/Reject to the Left'\\n\\nSeptember 15, 2019, issue: Within the world of dating apps, swiping left immediately translates to rejection. I wanted to illustrate how all of that possibility — those lost connections and lost conversations — can so easily dissolve into thin air.\\n\\n'Stupor Bowl'\\n\\nSept. 8, 2019, issue: It's the start of football season, so I wanted to depict a barfly in their own world at a sports bar, while everyone else is cheering. I kept sketching the Super Bowl trophy and realized that, with a little tweaking, it could easily look like a figure resting their head on their hand in a completely disinterested way. I had Dürer's 'Melencolia' in mind, along with Brancusi's sculpture work.\\n\\n'A Tale of Two Seasons'\\n\\nSept. 1, 2019, issue: I'm definitely a summer person. There's nothing I like more than spending my days going to the beach and painting outside. Getting back to urban life in September always feels to me like a total drag. (Much as it probably does for members of Congress.)\\n\\n'Back to School'\\n\\nAug. 25, 2019, issue: The hordes of commuting parents taking their children back to school feels like a modern and urban ritual. It's completely opposite from my experience as a kid. I grew up in a very small village in southern Germany, where my friends and I walked to school alone. We felt very grown up and had a lot of fun.\\n\\n'Outsourced Self-Care'\\n\\nAug. 11, 2019, issue: I know a lot of people who indulge in a self-care day. It's important to put yourself first once in a while, but some people feel that 'self-care' means emptying your wallet.\\n\\n'Family Portrait'\\n\\nAug. 4, 2019, issue: My grandmother was our family's voice of wisdom around the dinner table when I was growing up — the one we all turned to with questions about obscure facts. I'm not sure how she'd react if she knew that now we refer our dinner-table questions to a blue-light-emitting speaker on a shelf.\\n\\n'Summer on 18th Street'\\n\\nJuly 28, 2019, issue: Since Washington is known for its formal institutions, I wanted to depict a D.C. neighborhood after the sun goes down: bustling with nightlife and cultural diversity, juxtaposed against the city's rowhouses.\\n\\n'Nature Can Wait'\\n\\nJuly 21, 2019, issue: So many of us sweat it out while confined within four walls, rather than outside, where nature can heal us. I cycle and run; for both, I just need to step out my front door. Exercising inside, on a machine, seems sacrilegious.\\n\\n'Detained Childhood'\\n\\nJuly 14, 2019, issue: The playground swing — an immediate symbol of the freedom and innocence of childhood — points to the betrayal of that innocence by America's current border policy. I have to believe that if supporters of the policy spent five minutes with children in the detention centers, or in the ultraviolent communities these families are fleeing, they would see that the truth of their hardship is undeniable and sincere.\\n\\n'Extinguished'\\n\\nJune 30, 2019, issue: Summer means pool season. While hanging out at someone's private pool can be relaxing, public pools symbolize community to me. They're more social — and more fun.\\n\\n'Home Delivery'\\n\\nJune 23, 2019, issue: We can outsource so much of daily life now: grocery shopping, laundry. It makes sense as a technological evolution, but it can be taken to the extreme. I love ordering in dinner, of course — but the human contact I get while wandering around the shops in my city feels important.\\n\\n'Excannabis'\\n\\nJune 16, 2019, issue: If cannabidiol, or CBD, can help in the ways it's marketed (alleviating pain, depression, anxiety, your dog's anxiety …), then it's easy to see why it's become so popular. Even if it's nothing more than a placebo effect, CBD triggers hope and belief, and those can be powerful allies.\\n\\n'Summer Vacation'\\n\\nJune 9, 2019, issue: The ideal of the family vacation is often far from the reality: There's the joy of spending time with your loved ones vs. the irritation of, well, actually being around them. We inevitably project great hopes onto summer vacation, and while those can be dashed, the beauty is that — come next year — we'll probably sign up to do it all over again.\\n\\n'Plant Life'\\n\\nJune 2, 2019, issue: 'Plantfluencers' — people who showcase their many houseplants on social media — are having a cultural moment. I can see the allure: Healthy plants broadcast one's appreciation of nature and symbolize adulthood, since there's a level of maintenance needed to keep plants alive.\\n\\n'Invading Snappers'\\n\\nMay 26, 2019, issue: When a city is inundated with visitors, like Washington in the summer, it can feel transformed by the tourists' gaze. Trying to capture a foreign space often means we voraciously consume it faster than we digest it, and only engage with the most superficial part of its identity. Still, it's easy to forget that where you're fortunate to live and work is the same place where others plan to spend their vacations.\\n\\n'May'\\n\\nMay 19, 2019, issue: Happy hour is a spring and summer phenomenon: When the weather turns, people want to be outside and be communal. I was going for a visual mash-up here — something recognizable as happy hour and something recognizable as spring.\\n\\n'What a Waster'\\n\\nMay 12, 2019, issue: I feel incredibly guilty about the amount of stuff we consume and throw out. As we evolve in the right direction and become more aware of what we can do to be better (no straws, no takeaway cups, etc.), our guilt increases around what we're still not doing.\\n\\n'Remix to Cognition'\\n\\nMay 5, 2019, issue: I'm a fan of the music of some of the artists accused of sexual assault, and I don't think it's possible to shut that off after learning about their alleged crimes. But now the specter of what they might have done will always be there — casting a pall over their music.\\n\\n'Winter in Spring'\\n\\nApril 14, 2019, issue: This week marks the premiere of the final season of the HBO series 'Game of Thrones.' I wanted this image of Daenerys (a character who represents political change) and her dragon Drogon flying past the Washington Monument to feel both melancholic and festive — like a farewell party.\\n\\n'Forces at Work'\\n\\nApril 7, 2019, issue: After handing our privacy to huge tech companies without fully understanding what we were signing off on — and how it would change us — we're starting to demand control of our personal information. A digital revolution is brewing, and it's about time.\\n\\n'The Myth of Merit'\\n\\nMarch 31, 2019, issue: The college admissions scandal brought to the fore how members of the upper class can manipulate ideas around 'merit' to prove that their success is not arbitrary. Since celebrities were indicted in the scandal, I used a green screen set to play on the idea of students' images being created for them by others.\\n\\n'March'\\n\\nMarch 24, 2019, issue: The revival of the social calendar in spring is an East Coast thing. I'm originally from Seattle, where we don't get punishing winter weather, so there isn't that same sense of freedom when winter passes. I think spring is a great metaphor for friendship: They're both about warmth, abundance, growth or regrowth.\\n\\n'All Eyes on Me'\\n\\nMarch 17, 2019, issue: The sidewalks have become the realization of a dystopian novel: The digital deadwalkers — i.e., people too immersed in their phones — are among us, and they are nearly impossible to avoid. Literally. I've had to move out of the way for someone on their phone and was annoyed by it, but also have done it myself because I really needed to read an email, says artist Franziska Barczyk. She adds that a recent trip to East Asia may help to break her from the fear of missing out that causes people to stare at their phones: I could only use my phone if WiFi was available. … Overall it was a great break.\\n\\n'Exposé'\\n\\nMarch 10, 2019, issue: The pasts of a number of politicians have recently been major news. And as the 2020 campaign unfolds, there will surely be more revelations. Voters can accept some dissonance between who politicians claim to be and who they are, says illustrator Matt Huynh. However, voters can't be infinitely forgiving: I think we aren't so naive to expect moral piety from representatives pragmatically dealing with messy expectations. But demanding an official resign or be otherwise punished for immoral, and certainly criminal, behavior is important to signal a standard of values and conduct for the wider community.\\n\\n'Scooters'\\n\\nMarch 3, 2019, issue: You've been there. You're walking down the sidewalk minding your business when — whoosh — an electric scooter zooms by. The latest transportation obsession has spread in popularity, not only in the nation's capital but all over the world. Artist Jean Jullien can attest to this. I've recently moved to Paris, and electric scooters are everywhere, he says. They're very fast and silent and feel like they could just hit you from any angle. I'm sure they're super convenient, but to this day they still scare me a bit!\\n\\n'Unloading'\\n\\nFeb. 24, 2019, issue: It has become a familiar refrain in American life: We're sending our thoughts and prayers. It's a go-to line for politicians and other dignitaries following a national tragedy. But is it heartfelt? In the eyes of some — with the increasing rate of gun violence and little to no legislation to minimize it — the phrase has come to be synonymous with inaction. Rather than filling theoretical boxes with empty gestures, says artist Jon Krause, those thoughts would better serve our country if applied toward tangible, collaborative solutions.\\n\\n'The Oust'\\n\\nFeb. 17, 2019, issue: If you're looking across the pond for relief from the political discord, try again. The United Kingdom is roiled by Brexit, its Parliament remains at loggerheads about how to proceed, and confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May is hanging on by a thread. For artist Adriana Bellet, the spectacle is personal: As a Spanish woman married to a British man and living in Sweden, Brexit is not only troubling but downright tragic, she says. For me the worst is the disappearance of a Britain that was warm and welcoming, that took me in and taught me how to be an adult.\\n\\n'The Doctor and the Rabbit'\\n\\nFeb. 10, 2019, issue: Need something to keep your mind off the political upheaval? Artist Lydia Ortiz has an idea: space rovers. Not only do the Americans have InSight probing the surface of Mars like a planetary doctor, but now China has a rover, Yutu-2 (or Jade Rabbit-2), on the far side of the moon, a first in space exploration. I like thinking and reading up on space exploration, most times to escape other things in the news, Ortiz says. It also often gives me perspective on how small I am.\\n\\n'February'\\n\\nFeb. 3, 2019, issue: Spring is still weeks away, but artist Chloe Scheffe likes how it remains a state of mind for some. Recently I saw a man carrying flowers in this very way, she recalls. The image stayed with me, I think, because it spoke so clearly of his other life — the life we all have, outside of work or school. She adds, One of my favorite things about East Coast winters is that bodegas still sell fresh flowers outside. I can walk my neighborhood in the dead of winter, during a snowfall, and see flowers in bloom.\\n\\n'Closed'\\n\\nJan. 27, 2019, issue: America is in the throes of its most contentious debate about immigration in recent memory. Reports of child separations, the use of tear gas as a repellant and the deaths of two children in December at the U.S.-Mexico border break the heart of illustrator Franziska Barczyk. The American flag stands for freedom and justice, she argues. However, the way migrants and refugees are handled, the opposite is revealed. [It's] the mistreatment of vulnerable people.\\n\\n'Not for Everyone'\\n\\nJan. 20, 2019, issue: In this highly polarized era, what of contemporary art? Like politics, contemporary art can certainly divide people. But maybe that isn't such a terrible thing. Art, after all, can be at its very best when it provokes a strong reaction in an audience. Eric Petersen says he is motivated to make people think and feel through his illustrations. Become visually literate by exposing yourself to art, he advises. Don't be afraid to like things that are unpopular or ambiguous.\\n\\n'Racing to 2020'\\n\\nJan. 13, 2019, issue: Decision time is here. No, not yet for you, dear voter. But, rather, for the men and women who will announce their candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president. Those looking to unseat President Trump may end up joining a free-for-all of at least a dozen candidates. For their campaigns to get any traction before the Iowa caucuses next year, they'll need to get ahead of the pack. Artist Matt Huynh hopes the primaries provide a more inspiring model than the 2016 election. I'm optimistically, and I'm sure naively, hoping that the 2020 elections can cathartically reassure voters of the soundness of the democratic process.\\n\\n'The Tripping Point'\\n\\nJan. 6, 2019, issue: Yes, it's winter. Yes, it's cold. But there's no question we live on a warming planet. The cracks are starting to show: A recent Trump administration report said that the effects of climate change, including wildfires, hurricanes and heat waves, are already battering the United States. I don't think it takes a science degree to see what is happening in the world, artist Jon Krause says. Neil deGrasse Tyson had a great quote in 'Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey' discussing the mass extinction of species: 'The dinosaurs never saw that asteroid coming.' Climate change is our generation's impending asteroid. Hopefully we can make the necessary changes to ensure our fate isn't the same as theirs.\\n\\n'Roller Coaster'\\n\\nDec. 30, 2018, issue: We all remember what it's like to board a roller coaster for the first time. The sweaty palms. The pang of No Going Back once you get buckled into your seat by the attendant. The dizzying heights just as the ride crests. Maybe it isn't all that different from confronting the arrival of a new year — especially given the rather tumultuous times in which we live. As I grow older, I find that years go by much quicker, artist Jean Jullien notes. Too quick. At a scary pace, actually. And at the beginning of the year, you never know what it's going to be like, but there's no way of going back and no way of stopping the movement.\\n\\n'Coming Home'\\n\\nDec. 16, 2018, issue: Technology does wonders for staying in touch with loved ones when they're far away. But nothing quite substitutes for the experience of being in their presence. If you're traveling to visit friends and family during the holidays, remember why you're going the extra mile. Most of the year we are all so busy with our daily struggles that keeping contact with our loved ones via technology is not only convenient but even secretly preferred, says artist Adriana Bellet. The holidays are the only moment of the year when we are faced with the reality that, actually, there's no replacement for face-to-face time.\\n\\n'Sentinel'\\n\\nDec. 9, 2018, issue: Tomorrow, Dec. 10, is Human Rights Day, first recognized by the United Nations in 1948. For artist Lydia Ortiz, who was born in the Philippines, the concept of human rights first presented itself when, as a child, she visited the site of the Bataan Death March — the 1942 transfer of American and Filipino prisoners of war by the Japanese army. The lessons she learned about that historical episode continue to resonate with her as strongly as ever. With all the critical conflicts happening in multiple nations today, she says, we should remind ourselves of our obligation to monitor and enforce human rights for all oppressed humans everywhere.\\n\\n'December'\\n\\nDec. 2, 2018, issue: Sunlight diminishes. Temperatures plummet. We're forced to stay inside. The dawning of this annual ritual is only redeemed for many of us by the figurative warmth of holiday season social gatherings. Unless, of course, there is no one with whom you can share them. In my own work I'm often thinking about loneliness and melancholy, so this assignment didn't feel unnatural, says Chloe Scheffe of her illustration. A fluorescent season of merriment, the ubiquitous presence of social media: They can only paper over the loneliness that's out there. It's incredibly easy, notes Scheffe, to feel isolated in the real world.\\n\\n'Leave the Turkey Out of This'\\n\\nNov. 18, 2018, issue: Huzzah, you've survived the midterm elections. But have you really? Because, certainly, you'll need to gather with extended family and friends to dissect the outcomes and, even better, to forecast the presidential race of 2020 — all while fighting off the indigestion that can accompany this catered panel discussion known as Thanksgiving dinner. Illustrator Franziska Barczyk reminds us of the internecine conflict to come. German-born and now living in Toronto, Barczyk has been to a Thanksgiving or two in the States and offers this advice: Smile, breathe, listen, don't cut people off. And then, of course, give thanks for civil discourse.\\n\\n'100 Years of Poppies'\\n\\nNov. 11, 2018, issue: In Flanders fields the poppies blow / Between the crosses, row on row. So begins the poem In Flanders Fields by the Canadian Lt. Col. John McCrae, who served during World War I. McCrae, then 42, wrote the words in honor of a fellow soldier and friend lost in battle along the Western Front. The flower, consecrated by the celebrated poem, would become an enduring symbol of both sacrifice and the utter ruin of warfare, explains illustrator Matt Huynh of Brooklyn. This Veterans Day coincides with the centenary of the end of WWI, the 'war to end all wars,'  he notes. This image reflects on that 100-year-old promise for peace with poppies.\\n\\n'American Turf War'\\n\\nNov. 4, 2018, issue: Control of the U.S. House of Representatives hangs in the balance. The makeup of the Senate is at stake. Therefore, Tuesday's election results will be an illuminating moment for the direction of the nation. But, for New Mexico artist Eric Petersen, it's just the latest round of stupefyingly zero-sum gamesmanship between our two major political parties. This illustration was inspired by a very popular video game played by my 11-year-old son in which two opposing teams compete to cover the shared territory with their own color, Petersen said. The U.S. as a functioning entity is being erased by our partisan turf war. Is this what we want?\\n\\n'Knock Knock'\\n\\nOct. 28, 2018, issue: Are you ready for Halloween? If not, French artist Jean Jullien's piece about reversing roles might get you in the spirit. I've always liked the notion of masks and costumes and [their] symbolism, Jullien says. So the idea [of the art] is just to get rid of the mask and have what's behind as the scariest thing. I also like the reversing of position and having the child show up at the monster's house. In case you were wondering, when asked if the piece has any connection to Washington or politics, Jullien said: Absolutely none.\\n\\n'Our Awareness Time'\\n\\nOctober 21, 2018, issue: October is National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Researching the subject, Stockholm-based artist Adriana Bellet found that, although the health campaign helps create a support system for women, there's still work left to be done. Some studies show that the mortality rate for African American women is remarkably higher compared to that of white women, she says. I wanted to shed a light on that disparity.\\n\\n'Baked Macaroni'\\n\\nOct. 14, 2018, issue: New York Times art critic Howard Devree once compared Jackson Pollock's drip paintings to baked macaroni. So, naturally, when we asked Philadelphia artist Jon Krause, 42, to create a piece about food, a chef slinging pasta made total sense. Broadly, I'd just like to suggest there are many ways to experience the culinary arts aside from a beautiful and expensive plate from a five-star restaurant, said Krause, who made the art using spaghetti and tomato sauce after wet yarn and Silly String didn't work.\\n\\n'Awakening'\\n\\nOct. 7, 2018, issue: This issue marks a new beginning for The Washington Post Magazine: new features, new layouts, new fonts. But new beginnings can conjure many things, and for artist Lydia Ortiz — whose work appears above — it's insects. I've always been so fascinated by rebirths, Ortiz says. I love the image of an entity laying dormant for a while as it re-creates itself. The metamorphosis of a butterfly is a fantastic example of a physical renewal. Ortiz knows about change: She was born in the Philippines and moved to the United States at 19."}
{"original": "Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for 'peanuts,' only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO, Trump wrote. Meanwhile, British media speculated that the president was shunning the country over fears of mass protests that have delayed prior attempts to schedule a state visit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe comments added to a growing trail of Trump controversies involving U.S. embassies across the globe that have at times irritated Trump allies abroad and angered his opponents in the United States.\\n\\nAugust 2017: Trump thanks Putin for reducing the number of U.S. Embassy and consulates staff in Russia\\n\\nLast August, the president praised his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, saying that he was very thankful to him for deciding to expel over 700 U.S. diplomatic and technical staffers from the country in response to the United States increasing sanctions over the Kremlin's meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\\n\\nI want to thank him because we're trying to cut down our payroll, and as far as I'm concerned I'm very thankful that he let go a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll, Trump said at the time. There's no real reason for them to go back. I greatly appreciate the fact that we've been able to cut our payroll of the United States. We're going to save a lot of money.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether Trump's remarks were supposed to be a joke.\\n\\nSeptember 2017: U.S. considering closing its embassy in Cuba\\n\\nPresident Trump spoke with reporters on Dec. 17, three years after President Obama normalized relations with Cuba. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAfter dozens of Americans who had worked in the U.S. Embassy in Cuba reported medical problems, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last September that President Trump was considering the embassy's closure.\\n\\nWe have it under evaluation, Tillerson said at the time. It's a very serious issue, with respect to the harm that certain individuals have suffered, and we've brought some of those people home. It's under review.\\n\\nClosing the embassy would be a serious setback to U.S.-Cuban relations. The two countries only recently upgraded their diplomatic relations but President Trump has indicated that he may shift away from the pro-dialogue policy pursued by the Obama administration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDecember 2017: Trump recognizes Jerusalem as capital of Israel\\n\\nOn Dec. 21, the United Nations voted 128-9 in favor of rejecting President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. (Reuters)\\n\\nDespite strong criticism from the Middle East and carefully worded rebukes from U.S. allies, Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in early December and announced plans to eventually relocate the U.S. Embassy there, a decision that upended decades of U.S. policy.\\n\\nSeveral countries warned that the move would worsen relations between Palestinians and Israelis and spark unrest in the region, even though the protests that ensued were less violent than some had feared. Several nations later announced that they would follow the United States' lead, but the vast majority of nations remained united in their opposition to the measure.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGiven that it took almost a decade to move the U.S. Embassy in London within the same city, the announced opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem would almost inevitably fall into the hands of one of Trump's successors."}
{"original": "Apart from the vocabulary attributed to him, President Trump is right on target in his sentiment. As individual Christians, we have a biblical responsibility to place the needs of others above our own, but as commander in chief, President Trump has the constitutional responsibility to place the interest of our nation above the needs of other countries. I'm grateful we have a president like Donald Trump who understands that distinction and has the courage to protect the well-being of our nation.\\n\\nThe Washington Post's Josh Dawsey reported that Trump suggested he would be open to more immigrants from Asian countries because he felt that they help the United States economically.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBreitbart's John Nolte wrote that this perspective on race and diversity has been unfairly overlooked:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo one who identifies as a journalist is showing any desire to report the fact that Trump wants to boost immigration from a fairly large nonwhite area known as Asia . . . If Trump is a white supremacist, he is the worst one ever.\\n\\nHis argument, in part, is that because Trump did not say negative things about Asian immigrants, he must not be racist. (Just reminder: Four of the eight countries in Trump's travel ban are in Asia, because Asia is, well, massive.)\\n\\nAnd conservative commentator Carrie Sheffield argued on CNN that Trump's preference for Asian immigrants over black immigrants isn't about race but skills and talent. She said:\\n\\nThe president said he would welcome immigrants from Asia, so he is open to accepting people from other countries. So this really has to do with the broader — if you dig deeper here — to the question of is our immigration policy based on skills? Is it based on merit? Or is it based on natural disaster, or is it based on war? While they are not saying it plainly, the implication seems to be: Asian immigrants are skilled. Black and Latino immigrants are not. Ilya Shapiro, a fellow at the conservative Cato Institute, defended Trump's words, tweeting that his preference is rooted in economics, not racism. Note that he accepts the framing of shithole countries—so you have it on Larry Tribe's authority that Trump's comment was economic not racist. Interesting. https://t.co/m8kBvtrx4s — Ilya Shapiro (@ishapiro) January 11, 2018\\n\\nThese perspectives bring up another set of stereotypes about Asian immigrants, who are often painted as hard-working family units who have achieved the American Dream. It's known at the model minority myth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJeff Guo reported in The Post that as Asian began to come to the United States en masse in the mid-1800s, they were often portrayed as degenerates and job-stealers. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the first significant law limiting immigration to the United States. But some time after World War II, public opinion shifted, Asian Americans were seen as examples of family values and assimilation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy the 1960s, anxieties about the civil right movement caused white Americans to further invest in positive portrayals of Asian Americans. The image of the hard-working Asian became an extremely convenient way to deny the demands of African Americans. As Ellen Wu describes in her book, both liberal and conservative politicians pumped up the image of Asian Americans as a way to shift the blame for black poverty. If Asians could find success within the system, politicians asked, why couldn't African Americans?\\n\\nThis view also once shaped U.S. immigration policy. After decades of discrimination against Asian Americans — specifically Japanese Americans during World War II — the American government and news media began treating Asian Americans better, creating a wedge between them and African Americans.\\n\\nWu, author of The Color of Success: Asian Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority, wrote:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the midst of the black freedom movement of the 1960s, numerous politicians and academics and the mainstream media contrasted Chinese with African Americans. They found it expedient to invoke Chinese culture to counter the demands of civil rights and black power activists for substantive change. In 1966, then-Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan defended his controversial claim that the too-strong emphasis on matriarchy in black culture was to blame for the deterioration of African American communities by pointing to the enlightened family life of the relatively well-to-do Chinese. The magazine U.S. News & World Report unequivocally made the same charged comparison: At a time when it is being proposed that hundreds of billions be spent to uplift Negros and other minorities, the nation's 300,000 Chinese Americans are moving ahead on their own — with no help from anyone else.\\n\\nThis view was solidified in the decades following the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act as preference was given to immigrants with more education.\\n\\nEliza Noh, associate professor at California State University at Fullerton, told Voice of America that the immigration system favors Asians from highly-educated families in Asia.\\n\\nSince 1965, some Asian American immigrants have come to the U.S. under certain immigration preference categories that favor professional skills and training, she said. Those groups tend to already have educational training and economic resources, which they invest in their children's education. Their access to social and economic capital is what fuels academic achievement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe nation's makeup of immigrants began to change as a result. Since 1965, the population of South Asians, including Indians and Bangladeshis, and Southeast Asians has increased dramatically. And South Asians and Southeast Asians now account for the majority of Asian Americans in the United States.\\n\\nAsian Americans have long been used as proof that upward mobility exist for people of color, but history shows that opportunities and attitudes have not been evenly distributed, even among Asian immigrants.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the success narrative for Asian Americans, Guo wrote:\\n\\nAsian Americans — some of them at least — have made tremendous progress in the United States. But the greatest thing that ever happened to them wasn't that they studied hard, or that they benefited from tiger moms or Confucian values. It's that other Americans started treating them with a little more respect."}
{"original": "Flanked by members of his Cabinet and labor leaders, as well as construction industry representatives in hard hats, Trump told reporters at the White House that his proposal will allow highways to be built in a small fraction of the time.\\n\\nWe will not stop until our nation's gleaming new infrastructure has made America the envy of the world again, Trump said. It used to be the envy of the world, and now we're like a third-world country. It's really sad.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nInterior Secretary David Bernhardt said the president was making the most significant regulatory rollback of his term. Let me tell you, this is a really, really big proposal, Bernhardt said, turning to Trump. The proposal affects virtually every significant decision by the federal government that affects the environment.\\n\\nThe proposed rules would narrow the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires federal agencies to assess the impact of a major project before a spade of dirt is turned and to include the public in the process.\\n\\nThe changes would mean that communities would have less control over some projects built in their neighborhoods. Environmental groups, tribal activists and others have used the law to delay or block a slew of infrastructure, mining, logging and drilling projects since it was signed by President Richard Nixon in 1970.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nScientists say that as global warming nears an irreversible level, the president has been promoting business growth, not climate fixes. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe White House proposal will almost certainly face legal challenges.\\n\\nNotre Dame Law School Professor Bruce Huber said in an email that because the regulations do not alter the underlying law, agencies are still required to report the environmental impacts of actions they take that significantly affect the quality of the human environment.\\n\\nToday's proposal will involve changes to the way the law is implemented, and it will be up to the federal courts to decide whether those changes are faithful to the law, Huber said.\\n\\nThe proposed changes would redefine what constitutes a major federal action to exclude privately financed projects that have minimal government funding or involvement.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat interpretation of the law could make it much easier to build some pipelines, which have become controversial as activists have sought to block projects that extract, transport or burn fossil fuels linked to climate change.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFederal environmental reviews of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines dragged on for years during the Obama administration, but Trump has pushed to accelerate their construction since taking office.\\n\\nOther aspects of the proposal would set deadlines and page limits for environmental reviews so that, with rare exceptions, agencies would have to finish their most exhaustive reviews within two years. Currently, environmental impact statements for major projects can take three times that long to complete and can span hundreds of pages.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe proposal states that groups that fail to weigh in during the public comment period would forfeit any right to raise objections later in litigation.\\n\\nIt would also limit the analysis of a project's full climate impact. Effects should not be considered significant if they are remote in time, geographically remote, or the product of a lengthy causal chain, the proposal says.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnder that reasoning, according to experts, policymakers vetting a proposed coal mine or oil drilling operation would not have to consider whether burning those fossil fuels later on will contribute to climate change. Federal judges have ruled multiple times that the government needs to account for both the construction of those operations and the emissions that later result.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBernhardt told reporters Thursday that the changes would maintain the core aims of NEPA, while ending unnecessary delays for a broad range of infrastructure projects.\\n\\nThe consequences of the government being stuck in place are far-ranging, Bernhardt said, citing the drawn-out process for approving new schools on Native American reservations, upgrading visitor centers at national parks and giving ranchers approval for grazing on public lands. The list goes on and on and on. The reality is that the needless red tape has, over time, lowered the expectations of American exceptionalism and excellence. And that is backwards.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJay Timmons, president and chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, said his group had called for exactly the changes proposed by the White House because his members' efforts should be used for building the infrastructure Americans desperately need, not wasted on mountains of paperwork and endless delays.\\n\\nDrew Caputo, vice president of litigation for lands, wildlife and oceans for the environmental firm Earthjustice, said in an interview that the administration's changes could be legally vulnerable because they would remove so many projects from federal review.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe whole idea of the law is to give better information in advance to decision-makers and the public. It appears that these changes are an effort to undermine both of those purposes of the statute, Caputo said. It would basically make the federal government become an ostrich, sticking its head in the ground rather than thinking about the environmental impact of its actions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough the 1970 law is not well known outside certain legal and policy circles, NEPA compels agencies to analyze thousands of projects across the country each year. These can range from a mining company applying for a permit to drain a wetland to an energy company seeking federal approval to conduct seismic testing offshore or to lay down ice roads to hunt for oil.\\n\\nAccording to the White House, each year agencies weighing projects prepare approximately 170 environmental impact statements — detailed documents that can run as long as 600 pages each — and 10,000 environmental assessments, which are less extensive.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly railed against federal judges who have delayed projects on the grounds that officials have not conducted a thorough enough review under NEPA.\\n\\nI think it's a disgrace, he said after a federal judge blocked the Keystone XL pipeline in the fall of 2018, faulting the federal government for failing to complete a thorough environmental analysis as required by law. I approved it; it's ready to start.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday, a coalition of business and labor groups launched a new lobbying effort aimed at backing the proposed overhaul.\\n\\nWe're fully supportive and we look forward to the opportunities to have thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people go to work in the construction industry once these reforms are fully in place, said Sean McGarvey, president of the North America's Building Trades Unions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Hilton Kelley, an activist in Port Arthur, Tex., who has spent decades combating pollution from the petrochemical industry in his community, said weakening the law would have serious real-world consequences.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is doing a serious injustice to people living in industrial communities, Kelley said in an interview of the effort to scale back the bedrock environmental policy. It's a matter of life and death.\\n\\nKelley said the law has long given residents near industrial facilities, pipelines and other projects the right to have a say in what is built near their homes. He said he fears the changes will take away that important tool and tip the scales in favor of corporations."}
{"original": "Meanwhile, Wednesday's takeover of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob vividly illustrated the ongoing rage among many of the president's supporters, raising questions about whether Congress can return to a semblance of normalcy after an event that Biden said borders on sedition.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, the change in control of the Senate, with Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff capturing hard-fought runoff elections, theoretically affords Biden a narrow path to enact a more sweeping agenda, since Democrats will control all Senate committees and determine what bills reach the floor.\\n\\nMost immediately, Biden has promised additional help to struggling families by providing $2,000 relief checks. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who is poised to become majority leader, said Tuesday that another round of stimulus checks is one of the first things we want to do should Democrats prevail, noting that Warnock and Ossoff campaigned on them.\\n\\nIn another quick move potentially reflecting the new landscape, Biden Wednesday planned to name Merrick Garland as attorney general. Biden aides said the Georgia race did not affect that decision, but given Garland's symbolic role as a Democratic martyr after his nomination to the Supreme Court was torpedoed by Republicans in 2016, his confirmation could have been tougher with the GOP in control.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther items that may suddenly acquire new life are Biden's plans to expand the Affordable Care Act, launch a major infrastructure program, fight climate change and reform the criminal justice system.\\n\\nStill, most bills require 60 Senate votes to pass. Since the Democrats' wins in Georgia give them a 50-50 split, ties will need to be broken with a vote from Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris. So Biden will have to rely on his self-proclaimed talent for compromise to achieve many of his prized goals, especially following Wednesday's riot and its suggestion that the country's political passions are not fading anytime soon.\\n\\nThe Democrats' fortunes could erode in two years, since a president's party typically loses seats in midterm elections, giving Biden a small window for action. Biden appeared to recognize those challenges with a statement Wednesday, saying his determination to pursue bipartisanship had not changed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe American people demand action and they want unity, Biden said before the unrest broke out at the U.S. Capitol. I am more optimistic than I ever have been that we can deliver both. He added, I'm also just as determined today as I was yesterday to try to work with people in both parties — at the federal, state, and local levels — to get big things done for our nation.\\n\\nThe new outlook also gives enormous leverage to centrist Democrats such as Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), because losing even one Democratic vote on any major initiative could mean its doom. The more far-reaching actions demanded by liberals — such as ending the filibuster, granting statehood to Puerto Rico and D.C., and expanding the Supreme Court — remain almost certainly out of reach.\\n\\nNow, more than ever, we must enter a new era of bipartisanship in Washington, Manchin said Wednesday. With tight margins in the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans are faced with a decision to either work together to put the priorities of our nation before partisan politics or double down on the dysfunctional tribalism.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet liberals were quick to signal they may not be patient. As the Georgia results became clearer Wednesday, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser posted a tweet saying simply #DC Statehood along with a video of her telling a crowd, I was born without representation, but I will not die without representation.\\n\\nWith the change in Senate power, the chamber's entire agenda is likely to change. The leadership of every committee will automatically shift from a Republican, many of them hostile to Biden, to a far-friendlier Democrat, sidelining such high-profile Biden antagonists as Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\\n\\nRemoving the Republican grip on the chamber will also afford Biden the chance to appoint judges — including a replacement for Garland, currently a federal appeals judge, and potentially a Supreme Court vacancy if any justice steps down. And it immediately clears a path for Biden's Cabinet and White House nominations, many of whom Republicans have been slow to embrace.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeera Tanden, Biden's choice to head the White House budget office, faces considerable opposition from Republicans, for example, but the new Senate landscape significantly improves her chances.\\n\\nThe news of the likely Georgia results came just hours before Senate Republicans mounted their final major challenge to Biden's victory, with many formally objecting to the electoral college certification of Biden's win, an extraordinary move that turned a typically perfunctory ceremony into a fraught debate.\\n\\nAnd the final result — Ossoff's victory — came around the time President Trump issued a video statement to his supporters reiterating the falsehood that the 2020 election was stolen and asking them to go home. The Capitol was still occupied by protesters as that news spread.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBiden aides and allies said the Georgia outcome affirmed the wisdom of Biden's moves as president-elect, choosing to focus on his transition and bread-and-butter issues while avoiding partisan warfare even as Trump has behaved increasingly erratically.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe American people want action. They also want their leaders to work together in their interests, said Anita Dunn, a top Biden strategist early Wednesday. The message from Georgia last night is that is far more what people are looking for.\\n\\nBiden has not changed his overarching view that he needs bipartisan support, she added. In a 50-50 Senate you will not succeed without reaching out to the Republicans, Dunn said. But even if it were 51 [seats] or 52, he believes that the American people want both political parties to work together.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe said Biden plans to continue reaching out to Senate Republicans this week and next to look for places where they can cooperate. Biden has been talking to GOP senators since winning the election in November, though these conversations may take on fresh importance now that his party appears poised to control the chamber.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDunn declined to say who is on the president-elect's call list, but said the Biden team would aim to work with different Republican senators on different issues.\\n\\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said early Wednesday he hopes the Senate can make progress on issues such as China relations, climate change and immigration policy. We keep talking about those things, and in the last two years we haven't done very much to address those things, Romney said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDunn, however, took issue with political commentary that she said overstates Biden's prospects based on the Georgia races. Yesterday our agenda was dead, and today we can pass anything we want, she joked. That pendulum swings pretty wildly.\\n\\nThe most immediate impact could be an added incentive for Senate Republicans to schedule confirmation hearings for some nominees ahead of Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration, since Democrats may ultimately be able to confirm the individuals regardless.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNominees to positions such as defense secretary are typically fast-tracked so new presidents can have their national security team in place upon taking office, but in this case Biden aides say Republicans appear to be slow-walking the process. The president-elect raised that issue again Wednesday.\\n\\nMy nominees for critical national security positions at State, Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security have bipartisan support and have been confirmed by the Senate before, he said. They need to be in their jobs as soon as possible after January 20th.\\n\\nBiden and the Democrats may now also have a chance to undo recent Trump administrative rules like those loosening environmental regulations, potentially using the Congressional Review Act that Republicans used to great effect four years ago in rolling back Obama administration regulations.\\n\\nBut Biden will face a new challenge in keeping his restive party together without a Republican boogeyman like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who will become minority leader if Democrats take both Georgia seats.\\n\\nLiberal senators like Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) may feel emboldened to push Biden to the left, since it will be harder for a Biden White House to cite McConnell's opposition as a reason to hold back.\\n\\nAn evenly divided Senate also creates an instant high-profile role for Harris, who could be called on regularly to cast tie-breaking votes in the chamber. So far it's been unclear where Harris would focus her energy.\\n\\nAnd there is a final benefit for Biden: With new Democratic leaders of the Senate committees, Republicans' long-threatened hearings into his son Hunter's business dealings will likely be derailed."}
{"original": "Bloomberg's opponents on Monday began circulating audio of a 2015 speech in which he speaks in rather unvarnished terms about New York's stop-and-frisk policy targeting minorities. The basics of what Bloomberg said: Minorities are responsible for the vast majority of violent crime, and thus their communities were the logical targets for warrantless searches.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow, not only are Bloomberg's Democratic opponents circulating the clip, but President Trump is, too.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, who is reported to be wary of going toe-to-toe with Bloomberg and his essentially limitless resources, tweeted the clip Tuesday morning, saying, WOW, BLOOMBERG IS A TOTAL RACIST! (The tweet was later deleted, though it was captured in this Internet archive, and Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., retweeted the clip.)\\n\\nTrump is in a glass house on this issue. Not only is his record on racial issues what it is — most notably on the Central Park Five and Charlottesville — but he has vocally supported the stop-and-frisk policy. During the 2016 campaign, he proposed bringing it nationwide, and he reiterated his support as recently as 2018. He could say Bloomberg's description of the policy is crass, but it was widely known that the policy did pretty much what Bloomberg said it did, and Trump backed it.\\n\\nBut Trump's standing on the issue aside, this is the day Bloomberg's campaign had to know was coming, and the questions about it are thoroughly valid. Bloomberg finally disowned the stop-and-frisk policy when he began running for president, but he had previously defended it to the hilt. It's not unreasonable to consider this his biggest obstacle to the Democratic nomination, especially given the important role minority voters will play after Tuesday's primary in New Hampshire.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 2015 clip from a speech he gave at the Aspen Institute might be the starkest example. It isn't new — audio was released in real time by a reporter for the Aspen Times — but it is newly relevant. Here's what Bloomberg said:\\n\\nWe want to spend a lot of money, put a lot of cops in the street, put those cops where the crime is, which is in the minority neighborhoods. So this is — one of the unintended consequences is, people say, Oh my God, you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities. Yes, that's true. Why? Because we put all the cops in the minority neighborhoods. Yes, that's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is. And the first thing you can do for people is to stop them getting killed. Now we did a calculation of how many people who would have been dead if we hadn't brought down the murder rate and gotten guns off the streets. And the way you get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw 'em against the wall and frisk 'em. And then they start — they say, I don't want to get caught, so they don't bring the gun. They still have a gun, but they leave it at home.\\n\\nBloomberg said earlier that it's controversial, but first thing is, all of your — 95 percent of your murders, murderers and murder victims, fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male minorities, 15 to 25. That's true in New York. It's true in virtually every city. And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed.\\n\\nBloomberg's team sought to prevent such audio from coming out of the speech by blocking recordings of it, according to the Aspen Times.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBloomberg reversed himself on the eve of entering the 2020 race in November, telling a black megachurch, I was wrong, and I'm sorry.\\n\\nUpdate: Bloomberg's team has released a statement saying: President Trump's deleted tweet is the latest example of his endless efforts to divide Americans. I inherited the police practice of stop-and-frisk, and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused. By the time I left office, I cut it back by 95 percent, but I should've done it faster and sooner. I regret that, and I have apologized — and I have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on black and Latino communities.\\n\\nOne of the problems for Bloomberg here is how thoroughly convenient the timing was of his personal evolution on this issue. Perhaps that's not unheard-of, but it practically slaps you in the face. The other big problem is how vocally he defended the policy. It's not a situation in which he simply continued one of his predecessor's policies and made the most of it; he repeatedly said it was the right thing to do.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs recently as January 2019, in a speech to the Naval Academy, Bloomberg responded to a question about how the policy targeted minorities by saying, We focused on keeping kids from going through the correctional system … kids who walked around looking like they might have a gun, remove the gun from their pockets and stop it.\\n\\nHe added that other police departments just didn't admit they disproportionately wound up policing in minority communities.\\n\\nI think it's also true that most police departments around the world do the same thing; they just don't report it or use the terminology, he said.\\n\\nThat justification skips over the fact that the policy was controversial not just because of whom it targeted, but also the constitutionality of searching people who weren't accused of crimes. A federal judge struck it down in 2016 for that reason.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut that last quote betrays Bloomberg's biggest liability here. It's one thing for the policy to have the consequence of targeting minorities; it's another for him to acknowledge that's what it was doing and to say it was justified for that specific reason.\\n\\nBloomberg is relying heavily on a big showing next month on Super Tuesday, in which several states with large black populations will vote. The same poll as above showed him rising to second place among black voters nationwide at 22 percent. If that held, it would be a major advantage for him."}

Esper said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the quickly quelled uproar was indicative of what Milley called the highly dynamic situation in which the United States finds itself after Friday's killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike at the Baghdad airport.\\n\\nFrom the death of a U.S. contractor, the siege of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to the killing of Qasem Soleimani. Shane Harris explains how the events unfolded. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA policy afterthought for the past three years, while it served as a hub for military efforts against the Islamic State and a place from which to keep a close eye on Iran, Iraq has suddenly become a problem for the United States.\\n\\nAfter bringing the Islamic State to heel and claiming to be well on his way to stopping the endless wars in the Middle East, President Trump finds himself in the middle of an entirely new crisis on the same battlefield that bedeviled his two immediate predecessors.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere is widespread agreement among U.S. lawmakers and close allies that Soleimani, commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was responsible for years of terrorist activities by Iran, including attacks that have caused the deaths of hundreds of U.S. forces in the region.\\n\\nAfter President Trump threatened to strike Iranian cultural sites, a war crime, Trump administration officials said any such strikes would be lawful. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBritain, France and Germany on Monday issued a statement urging the United States and Iran to exercise restraint and avoid escalation. Saudi Arabia, whose deputy defense minister met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday, issued a similar call.\\n\\nWe are very keen that the situation in the region doesn't escalate any further, Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud told reporters in Riyadh. We hope that all actors take all the steps necessary to prevent any further escalation and any provocation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut many worry that the administration has no strategy to deal with the likely escalation of U.S.-Iranian conflict that will follow. That concern is most acute in Iraq, where the two powers have long vied for influence.\\n\\nThis administration doesn't have a policy on Iraq, said a former senior Iraqi official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid worsening a volatile situation. Iraq, he said, has been a subsidiary of policies toward Israel and Iran, seen as baggage from the last administration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer president Barack Obama came to office determined to end U.S. military involvement in Iraq, withdrawing all combat forces at the end of 2011. But his administration remained deeply involved in political diplomacy there and efforts to stabilize a democratic government. When the Islamic State burst onto the scene in 2014, Obama agreed to an Iraqi request to send U.S. troops, a deployment that Trump said he planned to end as soon as the militants were vanquished.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUp to the point where ISIS was territorially defeated last year, a current Iraqi official said, Iraq was on the radar screen because defeating the Islamic State was an electoral priority of the president. Once they were defeated, we were downgraded.\\n\\nMany Iraqis were taken aback early last year when Trump, in an interview with CBS's Face the Nation, indicated that the United States had Iraq and intended to keep it for its own purposes. We spent a fortune on building this incredible base, Trump said of the al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq, which hosts many U.S. troops. We might as well keep it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd one of the reasons I want to keep it is because I want . . . to be able to watch Iran. All I want to do is to be able to watch. We have an unbelievable and expensive base built in Iraq. It's perfectly situated for looking at all over, different parts of the troubled Middle East, rather than pulling up.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Sunday, Trump noted that the base cost billions of dollars and said that we're not leaving unless they pay us back.\\n\\nIraq has been seen largely through the lens of counterterrorism, through the lens of Iran, and through the lens of the partisan debate of the last decade, said William Wechsler, a senior Pentagon official under Obama, none of which is about the sovereignty and future of Iraq, which is what its people care about.\\n\\nWithin minutes of Sunday's vote in Baghdad — pushed by pro-Iranian Shiite representatives in a session boycotted by Sunni and Kurdish lawmakers — Pompeo had dismissed it as the flailing of an unrepresentative parliament headed by a lame-duck prime minister.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAny attempt by Iraq to follow through with the expulsion of U.S. troops, Trump later threatened, would be met with a refusal to leave and sanctions on Iraq like they've never seen before, ever.\\n\\nSenior State Department officials who briefed reporters late last week insisted that Iraqis want us in the country — an argument Esper echoed in comments at the Pentagon on Monday. But there are fears that events of the past few weeks have given pro-Iranian forces an upper hand and distracted attention from anti-Iranian uprisings that have swept Iraq in recent months.\\n\\nIraqis still view both the United States and Iran as malign forces in their country that are interfering in their country's affairs, pursuing their own agendas without caring about Iraqi sovereignty, said Ali Fathollah-Nejad of the Brookings Doha Center.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut at this particular point in time, he said, the Shiite-dominated Iraqi political class is using and abusing the situation in order to divert attention from the protests . . . and fanning the flames of anti-Americanism.\\n\\nFor the U.S. military, the concerns are more immediate. Already, the United States has suspended counter-Islamic State operations in Iraq and Syria while the 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq turn their attention to force protection in expectation of an Iranian response. NATO and U.S. training of Iraqi troops has also been suspended, and the U.S. government has told American civilians in Iraq to leave the country.\\n\\nCurrent and former officials said a prolonged pause in counterterrorism operations, let alone a U.S. departure, would hurt American security interests in the region.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nForce protection is our #1 priority. Period, Lt. Gen Pat White, who heads the international mission against the militants in Iraq and Syria, said in a message on Twitter. Beyond Iraq, U.S. troops across the region remained on heightened alert Monday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOfficials are particularly concerned about the potential for Iranian attacks within the next few days, now that the mourning period for Soleimani has ended. We are seriously concerned about the next 24 to 48 hours, said a U.S. official who was not authorized to address the issue publicly.\\n\\nThe administration has dispatched more than 4,000 additional troops to the region. An additional amphibious force of about 4,500 sailors and Marines is also scheduled to arrive in the region to support Middle East operations.\\n\\nThe order was disclosed as throngs of Iranians mourned Soleimani at his funeral Monday in Tehran. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, wept as he prayed over the general's coffin, and he and other Iranian leaders vowed revenge.\\n\\nBeyond the immediate threat, U.S. officials said it would be difficult if not impossible to continue the mission targeting the Islamic State in Syria, where there are 1,000 U.S. troops, without a presence in Iraq.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer officials and analysts said the Trump administration might seek to mitigate Iraq's decision to reduce the American presence, requesting dual key status, which would require Iraqi approval for all U.S. military operations or moving U.S. troops to the semiautonomous Kurdistan region.\\n\\nAt the Pentagon on Monday, Milley said he had followed up on reports of the withdrawal letter, which he said referred not to troops leaving Iraq but to movements inside Iraq and to new forces being deployed, saying it should not have been released.\\n\\nThe first part of it, which says 'repositioning forces over the course of the coming days to prepare for onward movement' was poorly worded, [and] implies withdrawal. That is not what's happening, he said.\\n\\nEsper said the United States remains prepared for any contingency with regard to Iran, and the message to Tehran is that the ball remains in their court.\\n\\nThe United States encourages Iran to de-escalate the situation, he said, adding that we are open to sitting down with them and discussing the issues, so we could have a more normal relationship with that country."}

He resigned with thousands of other Obama political appointees just before Donald Trump took office.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAiyer's unauthorized rides apparently went unnoticed for at least two years by budget officials who reviewed the invoices from Alexandria Yellow Cab, which has a contract to provide authorized taxi services for agency officials. The patent office paid the taxi company more than $4,000 for Aiyer's rides, the report says.\\n\\nThe evidence . . . establishes that Political Appointee knowingly used the Agency's Cab Company account for impermissible purposes on a routine basis and that he took steps to conceal his unauthorized use of this account by providing false names and false location\\n\\ninformation, investigators for Commerce Department Inspector General Peggy Gustafson wrote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe cab rides — and other abuses, including of his government-issued credit card — violated federal policy prohibiting government employees from commuting from their home to the office at government expense. Aiyer, who also served as a senior adviser on technology policy in the Obama White House and worked at one point for former District mayor Adrian Fenty, is not named in the report, which also does not identify in what Commerce Department division he worked.

A department spokesman also declined to comment, referring questions to the inspector general's office.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA spokesman for Gustafson declined to say why the office waited a year to release its report.\\n\\nAiyer told investigators that taking taxis to work on the government's dime was standard practice for officials at his level, naming several he said had told him they did the same.\\n\\nPolitical Appointee said he thought it was permissible to provide incorrect trip origin or destination information because this was the 'protocol that was imparted to [him] by [his] bosses at the time,' and 'because this is how . . . prior bosses approach[ed] it,'  investigators wrote. However, those officials told the inspector general's office they had not given them those assurances.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor most of the cab rides, Aiyer was picked up on a street corner a tenth of a mile from his home, according to the report. But he wrote on the invoice that he was leaving from Commerce Department headquarters in downtown Washington.\\n\\nHe once billed the government for a $54 taxi ride from his home to the Alexandria office on a Saturday, then $36.20 for a return trip that evening after a party, investigators found, concluding that he used the Agency's Cab Company account to facilitate his weekend social activity in this particular instance, but he made it appear otherwise when arranging for these cabs.\\n\\nPatrick Ross, the patent office's former chief communications officer, said in an interview that all political appointees in the Obama administration understood that ethics and personal responsibility were paramount in our daily service to the nation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat's why I was shocked and concerned when, as the individual identified as 'Agency Official A' in the report, I was presented in early 2016 with a lengthy list of cab rides in my name that I had never taken, Ross said. It was clear to me that someone at the agency was using my name, and putting my personal credibility at risk, to engage in actions that the individual knew was unethical and a violation of agency policy.\\n\\nAiyer also racked up $15,000 in expenses on his government-issued credit card, charging for food and drink at local bars, clubs, coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, dry cleaners and at least one liquor store, the report said. Investigators said he personally paid off the expenses.\\n\\nThe report says he also misstated his educational credentials on résumés he submitted to the Obama administration, claiming to have a postgraduate degree that he did not receive."}

{"original": "On Friday, Trump will address the march from the White House Rose Garden via satellite, according to organizers. But as marchers return for the major annual antiabortion gathering, almost none of the core vows the president made has been fulfilled and there's no clear sign they'll be attained soon. Even so, movement leaders don't blame the president — they fault Congress — and seem relatively hopeful they'll advance their movement in 2018 by limiting later-term abortions and expanding exemptions for businesses or people who don't want to be connected to abortion. At minimum, they agree, Trump welcomed their movement back into the White House and treats them with respect.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut that may be where the agreement about Trump's impact on the antiabortion movement ends.\\n\\nSome antiabortion leaders describe him as a pro-life hero and pose grinning with him and their children. Others say the vulgarity of the president is poisoning the future of the movement, which has worked to change its anti-woman caricature by advocating for things such as paid family leave and maternal health care. Still others say that Trump's changes are more about tone and that he reminds them of other GOP presidents who said the right things but never prioritized fighting abortion on a large scale.\\n\\nAs someone who loathes the administration, the short-term report card — [it] has to be said — is not bad. . . . Those of us who said, 'He's just playing you,' we were wrong about that — in the short term, said Charles Camosy, an ethics and theology professor at Fordham University who writes books and articles about abortion. But when we said that, we meant we're not fighting for the next five years but for the next 50. And what will our children think of the pro-life movement when it's headed by the 'Grab 'em by the p—y' guy?\\n\\nThe annual March for Life brings many thousands of people to the Mall, with buses from high schools and colleges and caravans from churches. It marks Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that said the constitutional right to privacy covers a woman's choice to end a pregnancy.\\n\\nAmerican views have remained quite steady for decades — since the mid-1990s, about half, give or take a few percentage points, have said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 40-odd percent have said it should be illegal in all or most cases. But the march draws a passionate, largely religious crowd that tends to highlight the political climate and take cues from whoever sits in the nearby White House and which party leads Congress.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring the 2016 election campaign, abortion advocates on both sides studied Trump's past as a supporter of abortion rights and Planned Parenthood for clues about how reliable, true or deep his conversion to the other side has been. At this point, the analysis of Trump seems to have stopped, and the focus has shifted to the fact that he has surrounded himself with leaders well known in the antiabortion movement, including Vice President Pence (who spoke at last year's march) and Charmaine Yoest, longtime leader of Americans United for Life and now a top communications executive at the Department of Health and Human Services.\\n\\nFor abortion opponents, this felt like night and day after the previous eight years, during which both parties became inhospitable to minority views (Democrats who oppose abortion access, Republicans who believe in protecting it) and the Democratic Party platform for the first time in 2016 called access to abortion core to women's, men's and young people's health and well-being.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUpon Trump's election, many antiabortion groups circulated his list of four key pledges, goals he'd worked out with movement leaders: nominating antiabortion Supreme Court justices, signing a law ending late-term abortions, stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and making permanent a ban on taxpayer money going to abortions.\\n\\nJustice Neil M. Gorsuch, before he became Trump's Supreme Court nominee, had not been called on to consider — or rule on — abortion as a federal judge. However, he has written about bioethics and human life with language that makes abortion opponents believe he will side with them on the topic.\\n\\nThe other three pledges don't appear to be going anywhere.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe House a year ago passed a bill to make the prohibition on federal funding for abortions — usually contained in a legislative provision called the Hyde Amendment — permanent, but the Senate did not, and it's not on the agenda. The House also last year passed a bill banning abortions in most cases after 20 weeks (considered a late term abortion, one of Trump's pledges), but a similar measure in the Senate is seen as unlikely to pass.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen it comes to Planned Parenthood, the House and Senate health-care bills contained provisions to block the organization from getting federal reimbursements, but those efforts died with the legislation. Under President Barack Obama, states were prevented from withholding federal money from Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinics; Trump last spring signed a resolution reversing that rule.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarjorie Jones Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which advocates for abortion opponents in politics, said that was not the federal piece abortion opponents were going after, but it is a type of defunding of Planned Parenthood. Everything is still in progress, she said.\\n\\nI don't know if I have any data on how pro-lifers feel about Trump in general, Dannenfelser said. But 'Never Trumpers' and others all acknowledge that he has followed through on his pro-life commitment, and they're happy about that. Trump is a pro-life hero, she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's a completely different atmosphere than four years ago, she said. We are encouraged, hopeful. The issue isn't buried. Candidates speak about it. It's not a movement in the ghetto. After eight years in the wilderness, eight years of having no ability to influence the president and then walking into the White House at the start of the administration — I felt like I was the pro-life movement walking in, after all those years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile Dannenfelser called late-term abortion the most effective piece of our ground game in moving voters, some say the issue is mostly symbolic. About 1 percent of abortions are performed in the third trimester (or after 21 weeks), according to the Guttmacher Institute, which provides research on reproductive health and was founded by Planned Parenthood.\\n\\nKristan Hawkins, leader of Students for Life, blamed Congress for the stalled agenda. Before the election, Hawkins had been skeptical of Trump's history and commitment, but after he won, she has regularly raved about him in Breitbart, posted photos of herself with him and her baby and said she'll urge activists at the march to press harder.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe're pretty disappointed that the GOP Senate and House have still failed to fully defund Planned Parenthood — that was and continues to be our No. 1 legislative priority. This is something the president has promised to sign into law, she said. I think that one of my charges this year is making sure pro-lifers don't get complacent and say: 'We've elected them. They'll do what they say.' No, they're not doing what they said. You need to push them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarch organizers announced Wednesday that Trump would address the event via satellite. They noted that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush had addressed the march by telephone, Reagan in 1987 and Bush in 2008.\\n\\nAbortion rights supporters said they were surprised more hasn't gotten done.\\n\\nIt seemed a year ago that Trump, with the leadership of the GOP in Congress, had the momentum to repeal and replace Obamacare, and certainly that also included the abortion provisions, said Heather Boonstra, director of public policy at Guttmacher. That also included the defunding of Planned Parenthood. This was a very real item and real concern for us. I think it goes to show how the Republicans just didn't have a plan, in many ways.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe do feel like this is an arc of a story that hasn't reached its final chapter, that these fights are ongoing, Boonstra said.\\n\\nThe core goals aside, antiabortion advocates had a list of things they were happy about.\\n\\nAmong them was the administration's expansion of the Mexico City policy, which withholds U.S. funding from foreign organizations that provide or promote abortion. The policy flips on and off when a new political party takes the White House, but Trump applied the policy to almost all global health assistance, some $8.8 billion. Past GOP presidents had limited it to the money the United States gives annually in family planning, about $600 million.\\n\\nAlso mentioned was a recent rule change enacted by the Department of Health and Human Services exempting religious employers who objected to an Obama-era requirement that they cover employees' contraceptives. That is being challenged by several states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAntiabortion advocates have been pleased with the Trump administration's high-profile efforts for their cause, including attempting to block four undocumented minors from receiving abortions.\\n\\nBut some longtime antiabortion figures say this all feels familiar: GOP leaders making promises about abortion but not following through in a dramatic way.\\n\\nIt feels like it was with Bush, said Bart Stupak, a former Michigan congressman and a Democrat who opposes abortion and worked to keep federal funding out of the Affordable Care Act. It's all political posturing. The only thing that seemed newly energized, he said, was the House's attempt at the 20-week ban.\\n\\nJayd Henricks, who just stepped down as the longtime lobbyist for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the main action both for and against abortion rights is in the states because Congress is generally broken, outside this whole issue.\\n\\nAt the federal level, one of the bishops' top issues, Henricks said, is getting the omnibus spending act to include a provision called the Conscience Protection Act, which would allow institutions, companies and people who oppose abortion to not have to pay for it (in employee health plans) or be involved in providing it if they are health-care providers.\\n\\nHenricks said he didn't notice Trump making a big difference in the movement, except for the impact of how controversial he is. I think [the Trump era is] changing clearly the character of the Republican Party, he said. Some pro-life folks are just as pro-life, but they are less Republican.\\n\\nSome activists said the national divisiveness over Trump is changing the direction they thought the movement was headed, one that looked at fighting abortion by providing paid family leave, chasing deadbeat dads and subsidizing child care and maternal health. That fuller approach, with a pro-woman and pro-child outlook, aimed to draw in more young people and even more abortion rights advocates.\\n\\nI certainly understand the perspective of those pro-life advocates who support him, said Kelsey Hazzard, president of Secular Pro-Life, who noted that things would be worse for the antiabortion movement under a Hillary Clinton presidency. President Trump has also sparked a tremendous backlash. His boorish comments give ammunition to the abortion lobby, which has long worked to caricature the antiabortion cause."}

Harry M. Reid of Nevada in 2010. Mitchell wrote a letter soliciting campaign contributions, alleging that Reid intends to steal this election if he can't win it outright....Understand, EVERYTHING we have worked for in the last year could be destroyed by dirty tricks and criminal acts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a phone call on Jan. 2, President Trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. Here are excerpts from the call. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs evidence, she said that teachers' union representatives were offering Starbucks cards to people who voted for Reid. The secretary of state's office dismissed her complaint, and Reid won reelection.\\n\\nMitchell's role as a Trump legal adviser, which received widespread attention after The Washington Post on Sunday published audio and a transcript of the call, has surprised some colleagues, particularly because she is a partner at a major law firm, Foley & Lardner, that immediately faced questions about whether it endorsed such work.\\n\\nIn a statement Monday, the firm said, We are aware of, and are concerned by, Ms. Mitchell's participation in the January 2 conference call and are working to understand her involvement more thoroughly. The firm noted that as a matter of policy, its attorneys do not represent any parties seeking to contest the results of the presidential election, although it did allow attorneys to observe recounts voluntarily as private citizens.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThroughout the hour-long call, Trump displayed an extraordinary degree of reliance on Mitchell. She is a onetime Democratic member of the Oklahoma legislature who became a Republican and has made a Washington career representing GOP candidates, committees and causes, culminating with her work after the election advising Trump.\\n\\nAt the outset of the call, Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Mitchell was not the attorney of record but has been involved in the campaign's lawsuits seeking to overturn Biden's Georgia victory. The attorney of record, Kurt Hilbert, declined to comment.\\n\\nStephen Gillers, an ethics expert at New York University Law School, said the issue facing Mitchell is probably one relating to the law firm's policy, adding, I'm sure the firm is dismayed by the appearance of its lawyer on the transcript.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMitchell declined to comment.\\n\\nMitchell, 70, began her political career as a Democrat, helping win passage of Oklahoma's Equal Rights Amendment for women and making history in the state legislature as the first woman in the nation to chair a House budget and appropriations committee.\\n\\nIn an oral history, she said that she authored a successful proposal to have Oklahoma become the first state to have universal preschool. I insisted that it couldn't be means-based, she said. It had to be universal.. . . It wasn't just some other people who were poor kids.\\n\\nMitchell, then known by her maiden name of Deatherage, married Duane Draper, a fellow Oklahoman, and divorced in 1982. He later came out as a gay man, became director of the Massachusetts AIDS policy office and died in 1991; he had the disease when he died.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMitchell married her second husband, Dale Mitchell, chairman of the board of Fidelity National Bank, in 1984, taking his last name. In exchange, according to a story at the time in the Oklahoman, he agreed to change his Republican registration to Democrat. Two years later, she ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the Democratic primary.\\n\\nIn 1992, Dale Mitchell was convicted of bank fraud, an experience that Cleta Mitchell later said was the result of overreaching government regulation. She became increasingly disenchanted with the social liberal policies she had supported and moved to Washington to become director of the Term Limits Institute. She advocated for allowing states to impose term limits on members of Congress, a measure that the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional. The combination of events led her to switch her registration to independent and then Republican.\\n\\nA glowing 1996 New Yorker profile of her after she arrived in Washington, headlined The Outsider, described her as having given up the pursuit of elected office and setting herself as a leader of antipolitical action. The story quoted her as saying she used to be a social liberal who would sit in the state capitol thinking of all the good things I could do with other people's money but eventually turned against what she called our entitlement mentality.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith her background as a Democrat and her newfound fervor as a Republican, she was courted by Washington's conservative activists, and she became a leading lawyer for GOP candidates and committees.\\n\\nShe came on the scene as a principled conservative Democrat, referring to her fiscal outlook, and emerged as a leader among conservatives, said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who hosts a weekly meeting in Washington for conservative activists and intellectuals.\\n\\nShe became associated with legal matters involving the Republican Party, the National Rifle Association and other politically active groups — particularly around campaign finance law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe talked to Republicans about how efforts to promote voter integrity and campaign finance reform were weaponized by Democrats as a way of limiting the political power of conservatives, Norquist said. She had a working knowledge of the Democratic Party and brought to Republicans an awareness of how Democrats were advocating for politics that would effectively shut down political opponents.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne of Mitchell's high-profile cases concerned a challenge to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law brought by the National Rifle Association and others in 2002.\\n\\nMitchell was co-counsel in that case with Charles Cooper, a conservative constitutional lawyer also representing the NRA. The pair argued that the law's ban on soft money and other activities limited the First Amendment rights of the NRA and other groups. The court largely upheld the law in that case, but in subsequent challenges ruled in favor of claims that campaign finance rules undermined First Amendment rights of free speech.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe is a very solid lawyer and very knowledgeable in election and campaign finance law, Cooper said.\\n\\nCooper said he listened to audio of the Saturday phone call in which Mitchell advocated for Trump's effort to overturn the election. While Cooper said he does not believe that the Trump challenges to the election in Georgia or any other state have any merit whatsoever, he said that Mitchell, in her role in the call, was expressing a lawyerly frustration with an inability to obtain data necessary to investigate their concerns and to verify the secretary of state's defenses.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the Saturday call, Trump told Raffensperger that he risked facing criminal consequences if he didn't find enough votes to declare that the president had won the state. Raffensperger responded that the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.\\n\\nTrump then asked Mitchell, Well, Cleta, how do you respond to that. Maybe you tell me?\\n\\nMitchell complained to Raffensperger that we have asked from your office for records that only you have but had not received them.\\n\\nMitchell raised her claim that around 4,500 people voted after having moved out of Georgia. Trump interjected that the number was in the 20s, apparently meaning in the 20-thousands, but Raffensperger's general counsel, Ryan Germany, said those numbers were not accurate. Every one we've been through are people that lived in Georgia, moved to a different state, but then moved back to Georgia legitimately.\\n\\nMitchell concluded her contribution by saying that she hadn't even addressed the claim that voting machines were rigged, which Georgia officials denied. Trump interjected that we don't need to prove that machines were rigged.\\n\\nTrump said, All we have to do, Cleta, is find 11,000-plus votes."}
{"original": "In 1812, Madison presided over a nation bitterly divided between two political parties — Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. As war raged between Britain and France in Europe, the parties disagreed over foreign policy and staked out opposing sides of the conflict. Federalists accused Democratic-Republicans of serving French interests, and Democratic-Republicans charged Federalists with inviting British dominion over the United States.\\n\\nEarly in the year, John Henry, a former British spy embittered by his poor compensation, decided to exact revenge on Britain by selling secret British documents to Madison's Democratic-Republican administration. The documents purportedly contained incriminating information about Federalists who conspired with the British government against the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHenry worked through a French national named Paul-Émile Soubiron, a sleazy con artist who helped Henry recruit the favor of the French ambassador in Washington. Hoping that the documents would compel the United States to join France in war against Britain, the ambassador used Soubiron as a sort of shadow representative. Like Russian agents who peddle conspiracy theories of Ukraine's collusion with Democrats, the ambassador hoped to convince the president that they shared a British enemy who cooperated with a supposedly debased opposition party in America.\\n\\nMadison took the bait, jumping at the opportunity to confirm his suspicions about his political adversaries. He spent $50,000 of State Department money to obtain the documents. The administration asked Henry to write a misleading cover letter that implied that he donated the documents to the government, withholding the fact that Madison had paid the entire balance of the contingent foreign intercourse budget to receive them.\\n\\nInitially, the papers did embarrass the president's political adversaries after he argued that they proved Federalist collusion with Britain. Madison's ally Thomas Jefferson privately gloated that the information prostrated Federalists. In reality, however, while the documents showed that some Federalists harbored antipathy for the union and sympathy for Britain, they yielded no legally damaging information.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFederalists' embarrassment turned to outrage after they learned how Madison obtained the documents. They charged that he had paid a vast sum of public money to foreign nationals for his personal political benefit. Madison admitted in a private letter that the documents did not legally implicate Federalists even though they proved that Britain had tried to enlist Federalists' help.\\n\\nIn June, Madison referenced the papers as a reason to declare war on Britain, claiming that they at least revealed British malfeasance for attempting to interfere in U.S. politics and recruit disaffected Americans.\\n\\nDespite Federalist indignation, there was never a whisper in Congress about impeaching the president over the issue. As the minority party in both houses of Congress, Federalists had little ability to impeach or remove the president, but they never called for it or even hinted at it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is impossible to ignore present-day comparisons. Trump and Madison both got caught up in conspiracy theories that foreign actors held legal dirt on their political rivals. Neither possessed good evidence that his opponents had committed crimes, but they still leveraged public money and executive resources to obtain potentially incriminating information about political foes. Both initially tried to hide their actions from Congress and the public (Madison with Henry's misleading cover letter and Trump with the placement of the July 25 call transcript in a secure server). Both schemes also had the cover of a legitimate investigation into wrongdoing and foreign interference, even as the president accepted help from corrupt foreign nationals (such as Soubiron in Madison's case or Ukrainian Yuri Lutsenko in Trump's).\\n\\nNearly point by point, Madison engaged in the same conduct as Trump — reacting to political opposition with imprudent, improper and reckless behavior. But imprudence, impropriety and recklessness do not necessarily warrant impeachment and removal — as the Madison case proved at a time when many of the Founders, with their closer understanding of what the impeachment clause intended, remained involved in American politics.\\n\\nMany pundits and politicians have described Trump's actions as unprecedented. Actually, what is unprecedented about the situation is the opposition party's decision to impeach the president over such actions — something even hyperpartisan Federalists avoided suggesting against Madison (except for some minor grumblings a couple years later over a separate matter).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe founding period serves as a warning that partisan political paranoia may advance the interests of foreign powers. Only France emerged a winner from the Henry-Madison affair after the situation embarrassed Great Britain, the Federalists and Madison. As the French ambassador had hoped, it further soured relations between the United States and England.\\n\\nWhat's more troubling is how these accusations and counter-accusations of foreign collusion brought the Founders dangerously close to criminalizing political dissent. In 1798, Federalists criminalized slander against the president — Federalist John Adams at the time — on the pretext that Democratic-Republican printers would embolden America's enemies in France. Democratic-Republicans responded in kind when they gained power. The Henry-Madison episode was only one instance in a longer history of accusing political opponents of foreign collusion and criminality.\\n\\nThe cycle had a calamitous impact on foreign policy. By 1812, misguidedly convinced that only military combat could purge the nation of British interference, Democratic-Republicans declared a war on Britain that reduced the capital to ashes two years later. Since Republicans' ill-advised impeachment of President Bill Clinton in 1998, Americans have once more edged ever closer to criminalizing political difference. The trend accelerated in 2016 when Trump supporters cheered for the imprisonment of Hillary Clinton with gleeful cries of Lock her up!\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nForeign interference has again heightened the tension. Americans have endured three years of criminal probes of the president for alleged foreign collusion. In response, Trump and his allies have answered with calls to investigate the investigators — claiming that politically biased law enforcement officials spied on Trump's campaign.\\n\\nAmerican partisans have developed a worrisome enthusiasm for accusing their political rivals of criminal behavior.\\n\\nLike Madison's interactions with Henry and Soubiron, Trump's actions in Ukraine expose a troubling tendency to go to dangerous lengths to find criminal connections between political enemies and foreign nationals or governments. They are symptoms of a disease far worse than a single problematic presidency. They reveal that Americans have again become caught in a cycle of accusing each other of foreign collusion, which exacerbates political partisanship, which facilitates foreign interference, which again prompts accusations of foreign collusion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "For December 2017, we tallied 796 protests, demonstrations, strikes, marches, sit-ins and rallies in the United States, with at least one in every state and the District of Columbia. Our conservative guess is that between 58,986 and 81,091 people showed up at these political gatherings, although it is likely there were far more. Because mainstream media often neglect to report nonviolent actions — especially small ones — it is probable that we did not record every event that took place. For 28 percent of the events we listed this month, we lacked an estimate of crowd size.\\n\\nNevertheless, we think our tally gives us a useful pool of information to better understand political mobilization in the United States — particularly how reports of crowds change from month to month. The number of protests remains fairly stable month to month, and December 2017 is no exception, although the crowds at 2017's end were somewhat smaller than they were earlier in 2017.\\n\\n1) The opposition to Trump\\n\\nA larger share of December's protests were against the Trump administration than in November. Whereas such events represented roughly 77.8 percent of crowds in November 2017, we estimate 88.5 percent of the events we recorded in December were opposing President Trump's policies. About 62.4 percent overall were explicitly anti-Trump while another 26.1 percent overall took stances on issues that contradict the president.\\n\\nProtesters gathered at the Russell Senate Building on Capitol Hill on Dec. 18 to protest the GOP tax bill, and several were arrested. (Twitter/Mariam Ehrari via Storyful)\\n\\nAt least 65 protests focused on DACA. In La Palma, Calif., protesters demanded a clean Dreamers Act; others staged a die-in. Almost 50 protests focused on net neutrality, many taking place outside Verizon stores in places like Bennington, Vt.; Boise, Idaho; and Boston.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe also saw a number of protests against many of the same issues that have already been in the spotlight: decrying police shootings and racism, ending homelessness and fighting gun violence on the fifth anniversary of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Meanwhile, NFL players continued to protest during the national anthem.\\n\\n2) The support for Trump\\n\\nAbout 3.6 percent of the events we recorded were rallies supporting the president and his policies, either directly or indirectly. As a share of events, December's total decreased from November, when 6.6 percent of the events supported the president and his policies.\\n\\nFor example, on Dec. 5, before the Supreme Court, supporters rallied around a baker who had refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple. On Dec. 9, protesters spoke out in Austin against sanctuary cities. Antiabortion leaders rallied in Montgomery, Ala., on Dec. 15. And we counted several Roy Moore campaign rallies.\\n\\n3) Neither for nor against Trump\\n\\nThe final 7.8 percent of the crowds were involved in actions directed at other politicians or about issues that were neither pro- nor anti-Trump. We found a broad range of such topics, as we have in previous months. In one protest against the Line 5 pipeline in Lansing, Mich., a horse even joined the protest inside the State Capitol building. We regularly see protests against a proposed school closing. This month, for example, protesters were opposed to closing the Pioneer School in Portland, Ore., and P.S. 92 in the Bronx.\\n\\n4) U.S. protests about international issues\\n\\nThis month, we saw protests about international issues other than migration. Protests objected to slavery in Libya, human rights violations in the Philippines, and U.S. involvement in the war in Yemen. Almost 30 protests rejected Trump's new Jerusalem policy, with protests in places like Bridgeport, Conn.; Detroit; Kansas City, Kan.; Norman, Okla.; and Sarasota, Fla.\\n\\nDemonstrators gathered in New York's Times Square on Dec. 8 to protest President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel (Rob McDonagh)\\n\\nHow many people were arrested and/or injured in political crowds?\\n\\nAt about 777 events, or 97.6 percent of the total, police made no arrests. This was a slightly higher percentage of arrest-free protests than in the past few months. The numbers of protesters arrested increased from 128 in November to 371 in December, with at least 360 (more than 97 percent) of those coming in 14 cases of nonviolent civil disobedience. For example, 84 people were arrested at the U.S. Capitol while protesting the Republican tax plan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAbout four of these arrests appeared to be connected to violence or the destruction of property — the same number we counted in November.\\n\\nYou can download the data here. We'll release the data for January 2018 soon. In the meantime, we are still counting. Click here to submit information about a protest, and click here to volunteer to help us count."}
{"original": "The debate is playing out as the United States struggles with administering the doses it already has. More than 15 million doses of vaccine have been distributed, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data updated Monday morning, but only about 4.5 million have been administered.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Monday evening said it would be premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence to change the way the two authorized vaccines are administered.\\n\\nThe statement, by FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and Peter Marks, director of the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said the available data continue to support the use of two specified doses of each authorized vaccine at specified intervals.\\n\\nLast week, the United Kingdom made the controversial decision to prioritize giving a first dose of its authorized vaccines — even if it meant there wasn't enough to give people a booster shot within the recommended three to four weeks. U.K. authorities have said people could wait as long as 12 weeks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLimited data suggests a single shot affords some protection against disease, but it is not known how complete or long the protection lasts. The first shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 52 percent effective in the three-week interval before people received the booster shot. U.S. officials have said repeatedly that while it is worth evaluating whether different dosing regimens make sense, they do not think such a strategy is supported by scientific evidence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday. We don't have any idea what the level of protection is and what the durability of protection is. It's fraught with some danger when you're making a decision about the regimen you're going to use when you don't really have a considerable amount of data.\\n\\nWe're holding in reserve that second dose, because we believe we need to go according to what the FDA said is the safe and effective way to use these vaccines, HHS Secretary Alex Azar told Good Morning America.\\n\\nOn CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the federal initiative to speed vaccine and therapeutics development and distribution, said the second dose gives people an immune response 10 times stronger than the first dose.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe always said that these vaccines will be developed on the basis of science and all decisions will be made transparently on the basis of data, Slaoui said. Changing the decisions made … without any data I think would not be responsible.\\n\\nSlaoui went on to say that discussions were ongoing between regulators and Moderna about a two-dose regimen of half doses. But the agency's statement rebutted that idea, specifying that changes such as reducing the number of doses, extending the length of time between doses, using a half dose instead of a full dose, or mixing and matching vaccines to immunize more people would not be supported by the current evidence.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOthers argued that because of the severity and persistence of the pandemic, the strategy of holding in reserve a second dose to ensure people get their booster shot on time is too conservative. The first shot trains the immune system to recognize the coronavirus, but the second is necessary to muster a full response, cementing the immunologic memory that was more than 90 percent effective at preventing illness in clinical trials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy feeling is that we're better off giving people one dose and hoping we'll get a second dose than holding back a second dose, said Walter A. Orenstein, professor of medicine at Emory University and scientific advisory board member of Moderna. It's one of those things where it's much nicer to be a historian and look backward.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJennifer Beam Dowd, associate professor of Demography and Population Health at the University of Oxford, said she was initially surprised by the British decision to allow people to defer shots, but she likened the policy positions to wartime decisions.\\n\\nTo me, it's very compelling, giving the first doses to more people as soon as possible, given this exponential growth we're seeing in a lot of places, Dowd said. Under reasonable assumptions, that would save a lot more lives and hospitalizations and prevent more severe disease than doing the complete course on half the number of people in the next three months or so.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPfizer spokeswoman Jerica Pitts said in a statement that the company's vaccine appears to confer some protection as early as 12 days after the first dose, but that there isn't data on whether protection is sustained beyond three weeks with a single dose.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhile decisions on alternative dosing regimens reside with health authorities, Pfizer believes it is critical health authorities conduct surveillance efforts on any alternative schedules implemented and to ensure each recipient is afforded the maximum possible protection, which means immunization with two doses of the vaccine, Pitts said.\\n\\nFauci said there was scientific interest in the possibility that two half-doses of the Moderna vaccine might be effective in adults ages 18 to 55 based on evidence from an early clinical trial in which a subset of people received half a dose and had similar immune responses as the group given the full dose.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut, he said, regulators would have to decide whether that evidence was compelling, and right now, I don't think there's a need to do that at this point, because you've got to ask yourself: What is the problem, and our problem is efficiently getting doses we already have into people.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nModerna spokesman Ray Jordan declined to comment on the use of the vaccine beyond the conditions in its emergency authorization. At this point we wouldn't have any further information to share about any potential ongoing regulatory discussions, Jordan said.\\n\\nPaul A. Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the external advisory committee to the FDA, called changes to the dosing regimen without more evidence terrible ideas.\\n\\nWe did a Phase 3 trial which taught us that two doses of Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccine induced excellent, high-level protection against disease. We don't know whether a half-dose would do that; we don't know if a single dose would do that, Offit said. When people get on TV and say, 'Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good' — we shouldn't let the unknown be the enemy of the known.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAsked their views on the idea of a single dose, the transition team for President-elect Joe Biden did not answer with specifics. However, a transition official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in the absence of a concrete policy, said the incoming administration will follow the guidance of medical and scientific experts. If experts' recommendations about the number or pace of doses were ever updated, the official said, the Biden team would update the public on such guidance.\\n\\nMore vaccines are being manufactured, which will increase the supply — and the pressure to get distribution systems up and running. But the early months of this year could yield developments paralleling those in December, when the first two coronavirus vaccines, from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, were granted emergency authorization.\\n\\nThe one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial is fully enrolled and expected to report results by the end of the month, with an application for emergency authorization possible next month. The AstraZeneca-Oxford trial is ongoing in the United States. Slaoui recently said that the AstraZeneca vaccine could be available in the United States in April. A 30,000-person trial of a shot from Novavax vaccine began last week."}

And the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act was passed to make it clear that insider trading rules did apply to members of Congress, because members of Congress don't just have information about specific companies; they also have information about things they are going to do that could affect these companies.\\n\\nHave there been any prominent prosecutions under the Stock Act?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo. There have been prominent allegations, like the ones against Price. And if you're talking specifically about members of Congress, I can't think of any.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther House conflict of interest rules could apply to Price. While the House ethics rules allow a member to vote on a bill that has wide applicability, even if it will affect a stock in which he is invested, the House ethics manual warns that you may be getting into deeper ethical problems when you introduce legislation and then buy a stock affected by that legislation.\\n\\nTrump's transition team has pushed back hard against the notion Price violated any laws. Are there gray areas?\\n\\nThere are always some gray areas. That's why you have lawyers. So, for example, what is the definition of nonpublic information [that defines insider trading]? If Price knows he is going to introduce a bill, but it's also general public knowledge he's going to introduce a bill, then he buys stock in a company affected by that bill, is that operating on nonpublic information? Can he avoid the Stock Act by announcing the bill the day before and then introducing it and then buying the stock?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n[Note: Trump's transition team said in a statement that it was public knowledge Price was working on a specific medical-device manufacturer bill he is accused of introducing and his broker buying related stock for. In his hearing Wednesday, Price acknowledged buying at least one stock — that of an Australian biotech firm — himself, without a broker. Price says he will divest himself of stock that could pose potential conflicts of interest if he is confirmed.]\\n\\nHe's raised the issue that he has a managed brokerage account. Is he saying he doesn't in any way direct or instruct the broker what to invest in? Does he pass any information on to the broker? It may mean that the broker, on a day-to-day basis, manages the account but Price calls and says, I would like to buy this stock. If he did, there could still be a violation of the Stock Act. [Trump's transition team said the broker had the discretion to decide which securities to buy and sell in Price's account.]\\n\\nDoes the damage come not just in people using their power for financial gain, but also for the perception they are doing that?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVery much so. Your job is to serve the American public, not to make yourself rich.\\n\\nI wish [lawmakers would] understand that even if they think this bill is the right thing to do, when they take action that will allow them to financially benefit from it, they undercut their own credibility, and it calls into question the merits of the bill. And even if it may be the best thing for the country, nobody's going to buy it once they know you financially benefited from it.\\n\\nSo that leaves me to question how much lawmakers who do this really care about the underlying legislation vs. how much they are about enriching themselves.\\n\\nWhat happens if you are accused of violating the Stock Act? Is there any enforcement?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEnforcement has not been very aggressive. The Office of Congressional Ethics can investigate (yes, that office House Republicans recently tried to gut), and they can refer it to the House Ethics Committee. Depending on the facts of the case, the Department of Justice could investigate. But mostly [lawmakers are] in a closed system where they're basically judging each other.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think the balance right now is on the side of people getting away with things they should not get away with.\\n\\nWhat questions would you ask Price about this if you could?\\n\\nWhy is he so tone deaf to the appearance of ethics issues, and why does he think as a congressman he should put himself in a position where he has to constantly rely on the technical definition of why he's not violating the law? I would think you'd want to keep yourself away from that. Or don't join the government. There are a lot of people who look at the ethics rules that apply to government offices, and they decide they just don't want to join the government.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDo you think the intent of the Stock Act — don't make money off public service — is a fundamental American value?\\n\\nYes. If the average American hires somebody to do something for them, I think they would like to know if that person is really working for somebody else, or has another interest at heart.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou see people's confidence deteriorating and just believing members of Congress are all crooks. I think a lot of the problems we have today are from this erosion of trust, that members of Congress are out for themselves or they're out for special interests."}
{"original": "A deep, simmering unease coursed through the administration over the president's refusal to accept his election loss and his role in inciting a mob to storm the Capitol, disrupting the peaceful transfer of power to President-elect Joe Biden. One administration official described Trump's behavior Wednesday as that of a total monster, while another said the situation was insane and beyond the pale.\\n\\nFearful that Trump could take actions resulting in further violence and death if he remains in office even for a few days, senior administration officials were discussing Wednesday night whether the Cabinet might invoke the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to force him out, said a person involved in the conversations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA former senior administration official briefed on the talks confirmed that preliminary discussions of the 25th Amendment were underway, although this person cautioned that they were informal and that there was no indication of an immediate plan of action. Both of these people, like some others interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter.\\n\\nThe 25th Amendment details the steps to fill the presidency in the event that they are unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office. (Monica Akhtar, Amber Ferguson, Julio Negron/The Washington Post)\\n\\nUnder the 25th Amendment, the president can be removed from office by the vice president plus a majority of the Cabinet, or by the vice president and a body established by Congress, if they determine he is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.\\n\\nRep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Thursday called on Vice President Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to ensure we have a sane captain of the ship because Trump has become unmoored not just from his duty or even his oath, but from reality itself.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Thursday issued the strongest critique of Trump yet from within the Cabinet. Calling Wednesday's events tragic and sickening, Wolf wrote in a statement, I implore the President and all elected officials to strongly condemn the violence that took place yesterday. He vowed to remain in his position to ensure an orderly transition to the Biden administration.\\n\\nWilliam P. Barr, who resigned last month as attorney general, issued an even sharper condemnation of the president he served. He called Trump's conduct a betrayal of his office and supporters, adding in a statement to the Associated Press that orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable.\\n\\nMick Mulvaney, a former member of Trump's Cabinet as White House chief of staff and director of the Office of Management and Budget, announced Thursday morning that he has resigned from his post as U.S. special envoy to Northern Ireland. He said on CNBC that he informed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: I can't do it. I can't stay.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThose who choose to stay, and I have talked with some of them, are choosing to stay because they're worried the president might put someone worse in, Mulvaney said on CNBC's Squawk Box. He added that Trump was not the same as he was eight months ago.\\n\\nReferring to Trump's incitement of a mob of supporters to occupy the Capitol, Mulvaney said: We didn't sign up for what you saw last night. We signed up for making America great again. We signed up for lower taxes and less regulation. The president has a long list of successes that we can be proud of. But all of that went away yesterday.\\n\\nA trio of senior White House aides — national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien, deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger and deputy chief of staff Chris Liddell — were contemplating resigning, according to three senior administration officials.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTheir possible departures, which were first reported by CNN, could trigger a cascade of other resignations from inside the already hollowed-out West Wing.\\n\\nO'Brien, traveling in Florida, was appalled by the Capitol mob and angry that Trump attacked Pence even while he and lawmakers were under siege, one person familiar with his thinking said Wednesday. O'Brien tweeted support for Pence and did not mention Trump.\\n\\nI just spoke with Vice President Pence. He is a genuinely fine and decent man, O'Brien tweeted from his personal account. He exhibited courage today as he did at the Capitol on 9/11 as a Congressman. I am proud to serve with him.\\n\\nTwo of first lady Melania Trump's top aides abruptly resigned Wednesday night in what one close adviser to the president interpreted as a sign of their disapproval of Wednesday's events. Stephanie Grisham, a longtime Trump family loyalist who served as White House press secretary and most recently as the first lady's chief of staff; and Anna Cristina Niceta, the White House social secretary, separately announced their resignations, also first reported by CNN.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn addition, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews announced her resignation, saying she was honored to serve the Trump administration but deeply disturbed by the storming of the Capitol.\\n\\nPeople were looking for a reason to stay, and now he's given them an excuse to go, a close Trump adviser said of the president.\\n\\nAides mortified by their boss's conduct said they were weighing whether to resign or to stay in office to help ensure the transition to the Biden administration. One official said Trump would have to issue a statement committing to a transfer of power and to prosecuting the rioters to keep some of his top aides on the job for his final 13 days in office.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump issued a statement overnight once Biden was certified the winner, the product of considerable discussion with some of his advisers. It read: Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th. I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere was little communication among the White House staff, other than a message instructing officials to leave early and stay safe. Considerable internal anger was directed toward chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to four aides, both because of what many view as his incompetence in managing the White House and his willingness to prop Trump up while indulging his false election fraud claims.\\n\\nPeople who interacted with Trump on Wednesday said they found him in a fragile and volatile state. He spent the afternoon and evening cocooned at the White House and listening only to a small coterie of loyal aides — including Meadows, deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, personnel director Johnny McEntee and policy adviser Stephen Miller. Many of his top confidants — Meadows, son-in-law Jared Kushner and first lady Melania Trump, among others — were publicly silent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe's got a bunker mentality now, he really does, the close adviser said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs rioters broke through police barricades and occupied the Capitol, paralyzing the business of Congress, aides said Trump resisted entreaties from some of his advisers to condemn the marauders and refused to be reasoned with.\\n\\nHe kept saying: 'The vast majority of them are peaceful. What about the riots this summer? What about the other side? No one cared when they were rioting. My people are peaceful. My people aren't thugs,'  an administration official said. He didn't want to condemn his people.\\n\\nHe was a total monster today, this official added, describing the president's handling of Wednesday's coup attempt as less defensible than his equivocal response to the deadly white supremacist rally in 2017 in Charlottesville.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome aides were mortified that Trump was so slow, and resistant, in telling his supporters to vacate the Capitol, and they believed he did irreparable damage to his presidency and legacy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAides and a range of lawmakers begged Trump to call on his supporters to stop rioting at the Capitol. Some former aides echoed those pleas on Twitter, tagging the president presumably in hopes he might see their messages.\\n\\nThe best thing @realDonaldTrump could do right now is to address the nation from the Oval Office and condemn the riots. A peaceful transition of power is essential to the country and needs to take place on 1/20, wrote Mulvaney, the former White House chief of staff.\\n\\nAlyssa Farah, the recently departed White House communications director, wrote: Condemn this now, @realDonaldTrump — you are the only one they will listen to. For our country!\\n\\nWhite House aides tried to get Trump to call in to Fox News Channel, but he refused. He at first did not want to say anything, but was persuaded to send some tweets. Then they scripted a video message for him to record, which he agreed to distribute on Twitter. But the president ad-libbed by including references to false voter fraud claims that they had asked him not to include, the administration official said. Twitter later locked his account, enraging the president.\\n\\nHe didn't want to say anything or do anything to rise to the moment, the official said. He's so driven by this notion that he's been treated unfairly that he can't see the bigger picture.\\n\\nThis official described Trump as so mad at Pence he couldn't see straight. Several White House aides were upset that the president chose to attack Pence when the vice president, secured at an undisclosed location at the Capitol, had just been in harm's way.\\n\\nA former senior administration official briefed on the president's private conversations said: The thing he was most upset about and couldn't get over all day was the Pence betrayal. … All day, it was a theme of, 'I made this guy, I saved him from a political death, and here he stabbed me in the back.' \\n\\nTrump's fury extended to Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short. The president told aides he wanted to bar Short — who was with the vice president all day at the Capitol — from the White House grounds, according to an official with knowledge of the president's remarks.\\n\\nShort has told others he would not care if he was barred.\\n\\nAnother former senior administration official speculated that the day's events made Pence more popular than Trump. One man acted like a toddler, and the other acted like the second-highest-ranking constitutional official in the nation, the official said.\\n\\nJohn F. Kelly, another former White House chief of staff who has shied away from rebuking Trump over other transgressions, suggested that the president's leadership was wanting.\\n\\nThree men made comments today, two of them very helpful and meaningful, and should be remembered, Kelly said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's remarks this afternoon, just before the riots, were, I think, words for the ages — and not from a politician, but from a statesman. President-elect Biden's were presidential and right to the heart of what we have to do to heal ourselves.\\n\\nKelly also seemed to voice regret about Trump's election.\\n\\nWe need to look infinitely harder at who we elect to any office in our land — at the office seeker's character, at their morals, at their ethical record, their integrity, their honesty, their flaws, what they have said about women, and minorities, why they are seeking office in the first place, and only then consider the policies they espouse, Kelly said."}
{"original": "One tragedy is that Trump, notwithstanding his irksome personality, could have been a great president had he been able to control his temper and his tongue. Like Lear, he suffers from intermittent explosive disorder, overreacting to all kinds of unimportant matters. Trump's stream-of-consciousness Twitter storms in response to any perceived slight were childish tantrums, indicating a lack of emotional maturity that put terror in the hearts of normal adults.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTypical of narcissists, Trump demonstrated no capacity for empathy, whether it was letting stand a dubious policy of separating children from their immigrant parents — many of whom remain lost to their families — or demonstrating little concern for hurricane victims beyond their walk-on role in his continuing reality show.\\n\\nFinally, Trump's willingness to demonize certain people (Mexicans, Muslims and the media) while accepting unacceptable behavior from others (white supremacists, racists and armed radicals) damaged the nation. Make America Great Again was a fine slogan as long as it pertained only to business or military strength. But we soon learned that MAGA also stood for Whiteness and the good old days when White men were in charge.\\n\\nOne can safely say, for example, that our borders need to be more secure — and even suggest that reinforcements are essential — without making many people feel threatened. Or without separating young children from parents seeking refuge from drug lords, bloodthirsty gangs and destitution.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome, I assume, are good people, Trump said, referring to the caravans of people crossing our southern border. He might instead have added, I know that most of those trying to enter our country are good people, but some are not, and we have to make sure that drug dealers, thieves and rapists don't get through.\\n\\nGreat leaders know how to say hard things without wounding the innocent or stimulating dark hearts. Trump's instinct for the jugular may have served him well in the dealmaking meatgrinder of his native Queens, but most people in Main Street America prefer to get along and leave well enough alone. Trump has managed to make enemies of neighbors and divide families along partisan lines.\\n\\nThis brings me to the question I'm often asked and that I sometimes ask myself: How could Republicans, Christians, evangelicals and other good people support someone such as Trump, especially as he threatened our democratic republic by denying the 2020 election results? What could Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) be thinking in joining his crusade to reverse the election's results — that is, other than their own 2024 presidential campaigns and their craven desire to appeal to Trump's loyal base?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI think I know the answer: A certain percentage of conservatives think Trump saved the country simply by deregulating industry and keeping his promise to appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court. Full stop. He was their bulwark against decline and fall. They believe in his unsubstantiated claims that the election was rigged for the same reasons. It is all in the service of a higher calling: free markets, freedom of conscience, and a pro-life position that can't be compromised as a matter of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\nIf these are your operating principles, and if you believe the other side will irrevocably alter them, then holding onto power isn't negotiable. Denial isn't so much a political decision as a religious conviction. Or, as one political soothsayer recently said to me: When politics becomes your religion, people become irrational.\\n\\nIn this context, Trump is all they've got. They'll take him any day over Joe Biden and Kamala D. Harris, who they fear will take Biden's place before 2024 arrives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat's not how things work here, however. To believe all that is a fiction of its own.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, if this were ancient Britain and Shakespeare were writing this column, then Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) would duel to bring this drama to a close. And Trump would make his exit.\\n\\nBut alas. For such is fiction writ.\\n\\nRead more:"}
{"original": "The already extant business uncertainty caused by past short-term funding agreements and sequestration will be exacerbated by this current shutdown. Bobbie Kilberg, chief executive of the Northern Virginia Technology Council, pointed to the many members of her group doing business with the federal government that would lose revenue in the near term and have a difficult time planning for future growth. Since our region's government contractors receive approximately $1.3 billion in revenue each week from federal government procurement, a shutdown or the unpredictability of short-term spending deals are equally reason for concern.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn addition to the potential harm to businesses, the federal shutdown will leave hundreds of thousands of federal employees with a lot of spare time and no paychecks. Federal rules do not allow non-essential individuals to work for the government without pay, so many federal workers will be furloughed for the duration of a shutdown. Just look at the numbers: The federal government is responsible for 367.900 civilian jobs in the Washington area with a weekly payroll of $777 million, along with another 64,500 military jobs accounting for $122 million in weekly payroll and benefits.\\n\\nJeannette Chapman, deputy director and senior research associate at George Mason University's Stephen S. Fuller Institute, cautioned that the harm from a short shutdown was more reputational than economic. A short shutdown would reinforce the view held by many nationally that the D.C. region is defined by government dysfunction. She believed the actual economic harm from a short-term shutdown would be small, somewhat similar to a snow storm, and any lost economic activity would be mostly made up post-shutdown.\\n\\nHowever, the longer the shutdown lasts into weeks or longer, she identified much greater economic harm. Chapman pointed to households of government employees that do not have savings to cover expenses during the shutdown, workers that generate income from government contracting jobs who get paid hourly wages only when they work, and family-owned businesses that serve government personnel (such as restaurants and dry cleaners) as all being particularly vulnerable.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe was also concerned that there was no assurance that government workers would receive back pay after their furloughs ended. There is no federal obligation to pay back wages, leaving the issue to be addressed in federal legislation when the government reopens. After each prior federal shutdown, legislation was passed to provide for back pay, but that might not happen in the current political environment. The economic hole created if furloughed government employees are not paid back wages could be significant. Chapman pointed out that even if only 30 percent of furloughed civilian workers didn't receive back pay this would take $233 million out of our region's economy for each week of lost pay. This is money that will be lost forever – dragging down our economic growth and creating financial distress for many families.\\n\\nOur region is disproportionately and adversely affected by a national political dispute in which our region's economy is collateral damage. This is the downside of our region's strong interdependence with the federal government, a relationship that over time has created significant wealth and business opportunities.\\n\\nAs we look at the likely harm to our region, we should be justifiably angry at our national politicians for endangering our region's economy as a result of their failure to govern. However, we should also turn our anger into energy that we focus on the opportunities before us.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBob Buchanan, president of the local advocacy organization 2030 Group, reminded me that the shutdown is juxtaposed with Amazon identifying our region as having three of the 20 finalists under consideration for the home of its second headquarters project. We shouldn't lose track of the desirability of our private sector work force and our community.\\n\\nHe is right. I know from my own work that a growing number of businesses are locating in our region and growing in areas such as healthcare, software, education, consumer products and hospitality without any connection to the public sector at all. The reality of our region's economy is that we have a vibrant and growing private sector business community.\\n\\nIn life, we often learn much about ourselves by how we react to adversity: are we victimized by circumstances or do we meet challenges head on? This can be a moment when we take stock of the many advantages our region has, and we increase our commitment to growing our non government business community.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe can choose to endure the dislocation of a federal shutdown, and hope for a return to business as usual. Or, we can take the opportunity to show the world that Washington, D.C. is much more than a company town and celebrate our economic diversity.\\n\\nI think our region is up to this challenge. What do you think?"}
{"original": "Axios won't be scrambling in quite the same way. However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have any use for a major broadcaster. The site launched last week with a scroll-happy and highly readable presentation, not to mention a rather pivotal media partner in NBC News. NBC Universal is an investor in Axios and NBC News Chairman Andy Lack sits on the site's board. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, NBC News is among a few partners — Business Insider and the Information are others — with which Axios is launching events. NBC Universal has invested $400 million in BuzzFeed and $200 million in Vox Media.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Axios-NBC thing makes sense, considering that events have become a pillar of Beltway news offerings. Politico, The Post, the Atlantic, the Hill, CQ Roll Call — they all round up policy themes, talking heads and big-time sponsors as a means of propping up a faltering journalistic business model. In its early pitch to advertisers, Axios goes heavy on its relationship with NBC News. Here's the text from a slide that it has shown to folks in the business: Axios and NBC will host four exclusive events in the first half of the year on the defining policy fights of 2017 — health care, energy, economy, and infrastructure. The events will be co-branded as Axios / NBC and moderated by NBC News Political Director, Chuck Todd. We expect 100+ attendees at each event, spanning top influencers in government, politics, and business. Two sponsor slots ($75k each) are available for each event.\\n\\nAn NBC source familiar with the partnership told the Erik Wemple Blog that this description is an example of potential events or opportunities, but does not describe a firm set-in-stone plan. As part of the strategic collaboration with Axios, NBC News journalists will participate in certain events including moderating as appropriate. We will not comment on revenue sharing.\\n\\nTranslation: Sales pitches are sales pitches. Should Chuck Todd be unavailable to moderate an event, surely Axios will be happy with Megyn Kelly or Matt Lauer. Or with Hallie Jackson or Thomas Roberts. Any one of these television personalities brings name recognition as well as experience in conducting discussions. Big-money sponsors — not to mention attendees — adore these types of adjacencies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn concert with tech news site the Information, Axios is pursuing events that explain D.C. to Silicon Valley and vice versa, according to an informed source. PepsiCo, too, will be sponsoring a series with Allen interviewing all kinds of newsmakers.\\n\\nIn linking up with NBC, VandeHei and Allen are following a trail they blazed at Politico. Allen had a regular appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe, and VandeHei commentated from time to time as well. Both of them have also begun turning in Morning Joe hits as Axios execs.\\n\\nWhatever the punditry, it's apparent that Allen's history doing morning newsletters needs little boost from television or any other medium. Sources who work in the ad industry tell the Erik Wemple Blog that Axios AM, the longtime reporter's adaptation of Playbook, has nearly sold out of 2017 inventory. Over nearly a decade at Politico, weekly sponsorships for his Playbook climbed steadily upward, reaching about $60,000 by the time that he handed over the keys to successors Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAsking prices for Axios AM, say these sources, fall between $50,000 and $60,000 per week — and the sponsorships at this point are available only as part of a bigger ad buy. While he was writing Playbook, Allen got written up for journalistic lapses and for occasionally writing very favorably in his own voice on behalf of the newsletter's sponsors. It's possible that those stories helped his franchise."}
{"original": "On Wednesday, a successful West Coast governor who knows something about trade, Democrat Jay Inslee, suggested he would throw his hat into the ring for 2020. He is pitching himself as the guy to put climate change at the top of the nation's priority list. To govern is to choose, Inslee told MSNBC's Chris Hayes. He offered a list of his progressive successes — on voting rights, minimum wages, net neutrality, transportation, etc. — and made the case that green technology makes climate change a jobs message as well. He might consider stressing his entire record as evidence of his ability to successfully govern, which includes climate change policies, and his role in challenging Trump's vile immigration policies. Almost as an afterthought, he notes that renewable-energy legislation helped launched a multibillion-dollar wind industry and helped his state lead in GDP growth and wages. That seems to be his greatest selling point — creating a progressive haven while growing the economy, raising wages and saving the planet. If Inslee can articulate a vision entirely at odds with Trump's and evidenced by his successful stewardship, he could be onto something.\\n\\nAnother possible candidate with experience as governor of an economically prosperous state is former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe. His Post op-ed stresses his practicality. Democrats must maintain our credibility with a pledge of results that are honest and achievable, he writes. We can expand the Affordable Care Act and take on pharmaceutical companies' cartel pricing, pass comprehensive climate change legislation and substantially raise incomes through minimum-wage increases and tax fairness. And he deliberately contrasts his own results with a more strident progressive vision that includes guaranteed jobs and free college tuition. When the stakes are another four years of Trump degrading our country, do we really want to use the 2020 campaign as a first-time experiment on idealistic but unrealistic policies?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMcAuliffe will have to overcome his association with the Clintons and big-money politics. He'll need to avoid sounding like Debbie Downer raining on the progressives' dreams. However, his effort to tie his own candidacy, should he decide to win, with the party's successes running moderate candidates holds promise. (As we approach 2020, he writes, we should look at the candidates who won in swing districts in 2018. They are an energetic, diverse group who ran on realistic goals of lowering the cost of health care, improving education and raising wages.) He could make his message a unifying one as a candidate for all Americans (urban poor, suburban middle class, college and non-college-educated): Trump is hyper-divisive and a failure at governance; McAuliffe is the uniter who knows how to govern.\\n\\nWhether either or both of these governors can mount a viable campaign remains to be seen, but their presence in the race would provide a much-needed emphasis on practicality and competence. Trump, who cannot keep the government open with Republican majorities in both houses, could enter 2020 with a faltering economy, a massive debt, a health-care system hobbled by his own machinations and a ridiculous energy policy based on fantasies like clean coal. A competent governor from the center-left might be a welcome alternative to President Chaos."}
{"original": "In the past few weeks, President Daniel Ortega's forces have launched a wave of repression against civil society groups and journalism outlets that is choking off what little remains of democracy in this Central American country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe government recently stripped nine civil society groups of their legal standing and seized their assets. News organizations critical of the Ortega administration have been closed, and some editors have been charged with crimes including conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe government is trying to shut down all political dissidence and impose a reign of fear and terror, targeting its opponents, said Paulo Abrão, director of the human rights commission of the Organization of American States (OAS).\\n\\nThe crackdown marks a new stage in the government's efforts to destroy a protest movement that emerged in April and swelled into giant demonstrations demanding Ortega's resignation. Police and paramilitary forces responded by opening fire on protesters. According to the OAS commission, 324 people have been killed in the uprising. The government puts the toll at 198, including 21 police deaths.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn December, a panel of independent investigators named by the OAS concluded that the actions by Nicaragua's security forces could be considered crimes against humanity. They called for an investigation of Ortega, noting that the coordinated, sustained campaign by the national police could only be explained by a decision taken by the maximum authorities of the country. They also urged an investigation of the police leadership and judiciary.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAuthorities kicked the investigators out of the country shortly before the report was issued. The government responded to its conclusions by accusing the investigators of ignoring deadly violence by protesters. It also alleged that they were echoing the policies of the Government of the United States of America against Nicaragua.\\n\\nFor months, the government has pursued those directly involved in the demonstrations, arresting more than 400 and prompting thousands to flee the country.

The onetime Marxist fighter went on to lead the government until 1990, when he lost the presidential election.\\n\\nOver the next several years, as international donors sought to strengthen Nicaragua's democracy, more than 4,000 civic groups were established, according to Felix Maradiaga, the Harvard-trained director of a think tank in Managua, the Institute for Strategic Studies on Public Policy.\\n\\nOrtega was reelected in 2006 and began to consolidate power. Today, along with his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, he virtually controls many state institutions — including the courts, the National Assembly, the police and the electoral council.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the absence of strong opposition parties, civic groups and the media have effectively become a major political force, Maradiaga said. That's why it is so significant that Ortega's government is cracking down on those groups, he told a recent panel organized by the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington.\\n\\nWhen the protests erupted in April, the civil society had awakened. The press was really playing a fundamental role in energizing the population in its search for freedom, Maradiaga said.\\n\\nThe government's foreign-press spokesman and other Nicaraguan officials did not respond to requests for comment. But the government has said the protests amounted to a soft coup supported by its opponents, including those in civil society groups and the media. Among those it is seeking to arrest is Maradiaga, charging that he financed and trained the protesters. He denies the allegations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe most recent government actions target some of the country's most prominent civic and media institutions, many of whose leaders have historical ties to the Sandinista movement. For example, Confidencial, an independent news site, is run by Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a scion of one of Nicaragua's most famous political families and the onetime editor of the Sandinista newspaper Barricada. It was shut down Dec. 14. A week later, the cable TV station 100% Noticias was forced off the air, and two of its editors were jailed.\\n\\nLa Prensa continues to operate, but its publisher, Jaime Chamorro — the uncle of the Confidencial director — said it is being strangled financially by the government.\\n\\nOn top of everything, they have blocked our imports of paper and ink, he said. We only have enough to operate for two months.\\n\\nGrowing pressure on Ortega\\n\\nEight months after they started, the anti-government protests have largely been extinguished. But it is unclear whether the government's increasingly repressive measures will keep Ortega in power until the next election, in 2021.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe economy, which had been growing steadily in recent years, shrank by about 4 percent in 2018 as the political turmoil hit tourism and other businesses.\\n\\nAnd international pressure is growing. On Dec. 20, President Trump signed into law a measure aimed at blocking new loans to Nicaragua by international financial institutions. His administration had already announced sanctions against senior Nicaraguan officials including Murillo, the vice president.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the OAS is considering penalizing Nicaragua for violating democratic norms, a process that could lead to sanctions or to the country being suspended from the organization.\\n\\nToday, almost no one envisions the rise of a foreign-backed rebel movement of the kind that fought governments in the region in the 1980s. But in Nicaragua, there is a tradition on all sides of improvised weaponry, said Geoff Thale, a specialist on Central America at the Washington Office on Latin America, a research and advocacy group. You don't get civil war out of that, but you could get violent resistance. That is a concern, especially in the countryside.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor now, beleaguered journalists are trying to find a way to keep putting out the news. The offices of Confidencial have been occupied by police, but reporters continue to update the website, working from undisclosed locations.\\n\\nWe have improvised an alternative newsroom, said one reporter, Wilfredo Miranda. We are working by remote control."}
{"original": "The department found no credible reports of civilian deaths caused by U.S. operations in Libya or Yemen last year.\\n\\nOutside watchdog groups such as Airwars have put forward much higher death tolls for U.S. counterterrorism strikes. For 2018, despite a significant slowing of the American campaign against the Islamic State, Airwars found that air and artillery strikes by the U.S.-led coalition killed a minimum of 805 civilians in Iraq and Syria alone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe United Nations has found that international operations, mostly airstrikes, killed 406 civilians in Afghanistan in 2018. Estimates by Airwars, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and New America found that at least 13 civilians probably died in U.S. attacks in Libya, Somalia and Yemen, bringing the minimum for the entire set of countries to 1,224, far above the Pentagon figure.\\n\\nThe gap underscores the differing approaches that outside groups, which typically rely on witness statements and accounts on social media, have taken in piecing together information about U.S. strikes, and that of the military, which has slowly begun to incorporate such data into its assessments.\\n\\nThe report comes several months after President Trump's administration altered an Obama administration rule requiring a separate, broader annual report on civilian casualties.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House argued the change was made to avoid duplication with the congressionally mandated report. But the White House report previously included a tally including accidental deaths caused by military and intelligence operations. Its elimination means the public will no longer have access to information about CIA drone strikes.\\n\\nCIA strikes are far less frequent than they were under Obama, but the agency remains authorized to conduct such attacks.\\n\\nDan Mahanty, director for U.S. Program at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, said the report reflected improved military transparency about its operations overseas. But the lack of information from intelligence agencies brings the government's inconsistency further into relief and undermines this achievement, he said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe report also further validates our instinct that we clearly still have work to do on the degree of effort DOD puts into proactively seeking out facts that it doesn't have at its fingertips, Mahanty said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday, several advocacy groups, including CIVIC and Human Rights First, sent a letter to leaders of the House and Senate armed services committees urging lawmakers to insert more robust transparency and reporting requirements into an upcoming defense authorization bill.\\n\\nSuch transparency enables the public to be informed about some of the most important policy choices the government makes in its name — ones that involve life and death decisions, the letter says.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Pentagon found no U.S.-caused civilian casualties in Yemen at a moment when U.S. involvement there has become a politically charged issue.\\n\\nLast month, Trump vetoed a measure that would have ended U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia and allied countries battling Houthi rebels in Yemen. On Thursday, a measure to override that veto fell short of needed votes in the Senate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe U.S. military does not generally attack Houthi targets, but it has provided arms and refueled planes for the Saudi-led coalition, which has been criticized for repeatedly killing civilians. The U.S. military conducts a separate campaign against al-Qaeda in Yemen. The Pentagon's finding that no civilians had been killed referred to that operation, which BIJ said killed at least eight civilians.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe two deaths referenced in Somalia mark the first time since U.S. Africa Command was created in 2008 that it acknowledged causing civilian loss of life."}
{"original": "The question — rarely confronted by news organizations before — became relevant this week after the New York Times revealed that the practice of padding individual follower counts is widespread. The newspaper said dozens of prominent people, from entertainers to athletes to politicians, bought Twitter followers from a Florida-based bulk seller in a quest to appear bigger and more popular on the platform.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe story prompted the Chicago Sun-Times to suspend its well-known movie critic, Richard Roeper, who was among the people the Times said had bought millions of dormant or artificially generated followers from the company, known as Devumi. The Sun-Times didn't explain or detail its decision except to say it wouldn't publish anything further by Roeper until it completed an investigation of his social-media activity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNews organizations have detailed policies regulating their journalists' behavior on social media. The basic rule: Don't post anything on Twitter or Facebook you wouldn't say in your professional output, on a news broadcast or in a story. And yet, buying followers typically hasn't been addressed. Among others, NPR, The Washington Post and the Associated Press say they don't have an explicit rule against it, although padding one's follower count would likely violate general rules about maintaining credibility and transparency, according to both organizations. The New York Times, which investigated the practice for months, didn't spell out its own policy in its article.\\n\\nOn one hand, a follower count artificially inflated by bulk purchases leaves a false impression to anyone encountering the person's tweets and comments. It suggests that the person is far more influential and is reaching a far wider audience than he or she actually is.\\n\\nIn certain cases, it can be outright fraud; companies sometimes pay influencers — celebrities with massive followings — thousands of dollars to make an occasional product plug or favorable mention to their flock, which would violate journalistic ethics. If an influencer cooks the books to make his or her following appear larger than it really is, the companies are paying for something illusory.\\n\\nBut it's not clear that Roeper, who appeared for years on a syndicated movie-criticism program with fellow critic Roger Ebert, did anything more than stroke his own ego by packing his follower count (currently 224,000) with an undisclosed number of phantoms and phonies purchased from Devumi. The Times reported that it was able to buy 25,000 followers from Devumi for $225.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPurchasing social-media followers is sad, but I don't think it's a clear ethical violation, said Andrew Seaman, chairman of the ethics committee for the Society of Professional Journalists. General dishonesty and misrepresentation is a cause for concern, however. I think anything like this is justification for a news organization to ask: What else is this person misrepresenting?\\n\\nSeaman adds a bit of context to Roeper's story; he points out that Roeper isn't a straight news reporter, but lives in the gray zone between celebrity, journalist and commentator, offering opinions rather than hard facts. We should still demand honesty, but be realistic about our expectations, he said.\\n\\nBut there's not much gray in this issue for Kathleen Bartzen Culver, who directs the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin. She likens it to a newspaper inflating its circulation figures: A falsified follower count can falsely induce real people to follow someone they might otherwise ignore.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt violates the bond of trust and accuracy between a journalist and readers or viewers, she said. Buying followers is misrepresentation. Even one purchase [by a journalist] is wrong. It's wrong across the board.\\n\\nCulver adds that news organizations bear some responsibility for this by encouraging and sometimes rewarding journalists for having large social-media followings. By doing so, news organizations implicitly create the conditions for follower inflation, she said.\\n\\nIn the wake of the Times story, an editor at one publication frankly admitted that it had ulterior motives in cooking its follower count. Micah Uetricht, associate editor at the magazine Jacobin, said the publication bought followers to impress Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, whom Jacobin was hoping would write an article for it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBackstory there is pretty funny: we got the idea to have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar write for us but thought our reach might be too small for him, Uetricht tweeted. So we bought about a thousand followers to hit a nice round number, to try to impress his agent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut other publications were caught by surprise. Among the journalists identified by the Times as buying followers from Devumi was Joe Concha, a reporter and columnist for the Hill newspaper in Washington. The Hill's editor in chief, Bob Cusack, said the publication wasn't just unaware that Concha had bought about 5,000 followers in early 2017 — it was unaware that it was possible for anyone to do so.\\n\\nNow that we know about this, we'll prohibit it, Cusack said. He doesn't intend to discipline Concha, whom he said has apologized for the purchase.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConcha declined to comment for this article but said on Twitter that he bought the followers on the recommendation of a friend, a social-media expert, to enhance [my] brand. He described it as one-and-done and later seemed to dismiss the value of the practice: Net-net: nobody cares if you have 47k or 42k followers."}
{"original": "We're never too old for love, but seniors in assisted living facilities may find it difficult to follow their heart. And it may not be for lack of desire.\\n\\nMore than 2 million American adults are in this position, living in assisted living or in skilled nursing facilities. Need for long-term-care services increases with age, and recent estimates suggest that the majority of older Americans will utilize these services at some point.\\n\\nInterested in the sexual lives of older adults, we studied life in assisted living facilities and found that these institutions' rules and practices make it difficult for seniors to develop romantic relationships. Fixing that will require changes in how we view seniors' sexual desires and how these facilities are run.\\n\\nAdults of all ages have the capacity for and interest in romance, intimacy and sexuality. It might appear that older adults, especially the oldest old, are less interested in sex and less sexually active than younger adults, but sexual behavior and desire involve more than how often people have sex. Multiple social and health barriers can limit opportunities to pursue sexual relationships. For example, limited access to healthy partners because of living arrangements and unbalanced sex ratio diminishes opportunities as we age.\\n\\nAlthough assisted living aims to be an environment in which older adults maintain autonomy, independence and control, these goals do not necessarily extend to sexuality. As the baby boomer generation — a generation that came of age during the sexual revolution — ages and more older adults utilize assisted living, it will be important to create specific policies and training regarding sexuality. This holds true for following generations, too.\\n\\nAs researchers who study gerontology, we wanted to examine whether seniors' sex lives were being respected and protected.\\n\\nWe wanted to know more about opportunities for and barriers to sexual expression in this emerging environment. To do this, we conducted interviews and focus groups with staff and administrators in six assisted living facilities in a large southeastern city. Although limited to one city, our findings provide insight into the challenges of sexuality for residents of assisted living facilities across the country.\\n\\nA knock at the door\\n\\nThe term older adult is broad. It includes people 65 and beyond. Living status, health concerns, desire and other factors vary widely across this spectrum. Younger groups of older adults are more likely than older cohorts to be married or partnered, live independently and have more active lifestyles, which facilitate access to sex and intimacy.\\n\\nAt one end of the spectrum is the lonely, frail, cognitively impaired older adult who has no interest in or capacity for pursuing a relationship. On the other end are the frisky, swinging singles who are at risk of sexually transmitted diseases. But in reality, sexuality in later life is much more complicated than stereotypes.\\n\\nAs people age, factors change. Older adults may experience their own or their partner's health conditions, a need for assistance with activities of daily living or the loss of a spouse. Because of these and other changes, an increasing number of older adults are choosing intermediate care settings, such as assisted living, which is the fastest-growing segment of long-term care for older adults.\\n\\nAssisted living locations differ from skilled nursing facilities because the former are intended to provide minimal to moderate levels of help with everyday tasks in a homelike environment that emphasizes choice and control for the residents.\\n\\nMost of our respondents recognized the need for sexual expression and the desire of residents to have intimate relationships. Yet the day-to-day reality restricted opportunities for intimacy. This happened in two broad ways: surveillance of resident behavior and justification for limiting sexual freedom. Surveillance was subtle and nuanced in ways that limited sexual expression.\\n\\nFor example, staff needing access to resident rooms to provide housekeeping or care would frequently engage in what we term the knock and walk, whereby staff would give a cursory knock and then enter the room without waiting for a response. This act sometimes resulted in staff walking in on residents sharing an intimate moment in what should have been a private space. Thus, even in the privacy of their rooms, residents had limited opportunity to engage in sexual behavior.\\n\\nThe return of hall monitors?\\n\\nAnother way that staff controlled behavior was more overt and purposeful. We found that in public spaces such as dining and activity rooms, staff felt they had a responsibility to maintain decorum and keep the peace. As a result, they actively discouraged and limited contact between people who might appear interested in pursuing a relationship.\\n\\nStaff and administrators in this study cited various reasons they limited sexual freedoms in assisted living. Among those reasons were safety, family concern and consent. Policies exist at the state level that hold facilities accountable for resident safety. Yet there was incredible variability in how these policies were interpreted and applied within and across facilities.\\n\\nPeople who work in assisted living have to think about the needs of all residents in the facility and justify limitations as for the good of the whole. Because family members were frequently the ones selecting and paying for the care, staff and administrators were also concerned about family perceptions of residents' sexual behaviors.\\n\\nAlso of concern to administrators and staff was the health and cognitive ability of residents and how to assess the ability of residents to fully consent to sexual activity. Ethics around sexuality and dementia are still emerging, and facilities tend to err on the side of protection.\\n\\nAt least one nursing home has been successful at creating and implementing a policy that supports sexual freedom, a policy that could serve as a model for assisted living and other long-term-care settings. This facility allows residents the opportunity to be sexual and even facilitates romance through happy hours and a dating service. Some fixes are as simple as creating a do-not-disturb hang tag for residents' rooms.\\n\\nPolicies and training should address and accommodate the diversity of sexual needs and desires of older adults. Additionally, as the number of older adults with dementia in assisted living increases, staff and administrators will need to prepare for the ethical dilemmas regarding sex and dementia.\\n\\nPolicies and trainings on sexuality, aging and dementia have the potential to both protect the autonomy and independence of older adults in assisted living and prevent staff and administrators from acting according to stereotypes rather than the true needs of older adults. While more research is needed, we believe that all adults, regardless of age or living arrangements, should be able pursue love and intimacy.\\n\\nThis article was originally published on theconversation.com.

{"original": "A review of Romney's interactions with Trump since the beginning of 2011 — a period covering both men's presidential bids and Romney's Senate race — makes clear that Romney's attacks on Trump are well attuned to the political thermostat. When he wanted Trump's support, for example in 2012, Romney refused to criticize Trump's birtherism — unlike his strong criticism of Trump in summer 2017 after the president waffled on criticizing self-proclaimed white nationalists at a rally in Virginia.\\n\\nIn reviewing the past eight years of interactions between the two, we assigned a rough value for how warm or cold relations were between the two (an admittedly subjective analysis). Roughly speaking, the periods in which Romney has spoken most warmly about Trump correlate to moments when Romney was seeking political office to which Trump might contribute. An exception was shortly after Trump took office, when Romney offered his support for Trump's success.\\n\\nHere's how Romney and Trump's relationship has evolved.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarch 2011\\n\\nIn an interview on Good Morning America, in which he floated the idea of running for president, Trump first raises questions about President Barack Obama's citizenship.\\n\\nEverybody that even gives any hint of being a birther — a word you didn't use — even a little bit of a hint, like, gee, you know, maybe, just maybe, this much of a chance: They label them as an idiot, Donald Trump tells the network's Ashleigh Banfield when she asks whether he thinks Obama was born in the United States. After insisting that he was not an idiot, Trump explains his purported rationale:\\n\\nThe reason I have a little doubt — just a little! — is because he grew up, and nobody knew him. When you interview people — if I ever got the nomination, if I ever decide to run — you may go back and interview people from my kindergarten, they'll remember me. Nobody ever comes forward. Nobody knows who he is until later in his life. Very strange. The whole thing is very strange.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nApril 12, 2011\\n\\nThe day after announcing his 2012 candidacy, Romney dismisses Trump's birtherism in an interview on CNBC.\\n\\nI think the citizenship test has been passed. I believe the president was born in the United States, Romney tells host Larry Kudlow, now a member of Trump's administration. The man needs to be taken out of office, but his citizenship isn't the reason why.\\n\\nApril 19, 2011\\n\\nMitt Romney was a small business guy if you really think about it, Trump says in an interview on CNN. He was a hedge fund. He was a funds guy. He walked away with some money from a very good company that he didn't create. … He'd buy companies; he'd close companies; he'd get rid of jobs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm much bigger than this man and have a much, much bigger net worth. I mean my net worth is many, many, many times Mitt Romney, Trump adds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nApril 25, 2011\\n\\nHe's a terrific guy, and I wish him the very best, Romney responds on Fox News. I hope he runs. Come on in, the water's fine.\\n\\nMay 2011\\n\\nTrump's theoretical presidential bid is submarined after gaining little traction in polls and after Obama mocks him relentlessly at the White House correspondents' dinner.\\n\\nOn May 16, Trump announces that he will not run.\\n\\nSeptember 2011\\n\\nTrump and Romney meet in New York. Romney describes the meeting on Morning Joe:\\n\\nWe didn't eat lunch together, but we did spend time together, he says. I enjoy Donald Trump; he was colorful.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLate 2011\\n\\nTrump agrees to moderate a debate among the Republican candidates hosted by the conservative site Newsmax and slated for the end of December.\\n\\nDec. 6, 2011\\n\\nRomney joins other candidates in declining to participate in Trump's debate. Unlike Jon Huntsman — who tells Fox News that he was not going to kiss [Trump's] ring, and I'm not going to kiss any other part of his anatomy — Romney was polite.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI spoke with Donald Trump earlier today and indicated that we just can't make this debate, and we focus on the other two, Romney tells Fox. And, I will be campaigning. Trump, he says, understood my perspective and wished me well.\\n\\nDec. 12, 2011\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm surprised that Mitt Romney said no, Trump tells MSNBC. Frankly, I'm surprised, because he really wants my endorsement. I mean, he wants it very badly.\\n\\nFeb. 2, 2012\\n\\nAt an event in Trump's hotel in Las Vegas, he offers Romney that endorsement. The timing was important: The Nevada primary was looming, and Newt Gingrich had surged in national polling. The endorsement itself probably didn't make much of a difference, though: Romney won the state by 29 points over Gingrich.\\n\\nThere are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life, Romney says, after Trump hands it off to him. This is one of them. He goes on to say that being in Trump's hotel and getting his endorsement is a delight.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMay 2012\\n\\nRomney declines to disavow Trump's comments about Obama.\\n\\nYou know I don't agree with all the people who support me, and my guess is they don't all agree with everything I believe in, he says.

I think there is something there, Romney says. The reason I think there is a bombshell in there is because every time he is asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays.\\n\\nOver the next few days, he reiterates this idea in tweets. Trump, on the same platform, mocks him.\\n\\nFeb. 29, 2016\\n\\nAfter being endorsed by former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, Trump declines to reject Duke or the Klan in an interview with CNN.\\n\\nI don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists, he tells the network's Jake Tapper. So I don't know. I don't know — did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe later blames his response on a faulty earpiece.\\n\\nRomney attacks him for it.\\n\\nMarch 3, 2016\\n\\nAs Trump continues to win Republican delegates, Romney delivers an unusually potent speech attacking his candidacy.\\n\\n'Let me put it very plainly, he says. If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished.\\n\\nHe also targets Trump's main selling point.\\n\\nLook, his bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who work for them. He inherited his business, he didn't create it, Romney says. And whatever happened to Trump airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.\\n\\nHere's what I know, he says. Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.\\n\\nTrump responds.\\n\\nMarch 18, 2016\\n\\nRomney endorses Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\\n\\nNov. 8, 2016\\n\\nTrump wins the presidency.

The two are photographed somewhat awkwardly sharing a dinner at a restaurant at a Trump hotel in Manhattan.\\n\\nAfter the dinner, Romney says that the conversation was enlightening and interesting and engaging and that Trump's picks for his administration gave him increasing hope that President-elect Trump is the very man who can lead us to that better future.\\n\\nRomney reportedly was asked to apologize for his rhetoric about Trump during the campaign, an apology he refused to offer. Trump gave the job to ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson.\\n\\nEarly 2017\\n\\nAfter Trump takes office, Romney offers him his support, saying in a February interview that what people recognize is that he's doing what he said he'd do. I'm sure that's very encouraging to a lot of people. I think all of us, whether we are for him or someone else, have high hopes for our president.\\n\\nBut he also stands by his critiques: I expressed honestly what my belief was with regards to temperament and character.\\n\\nAug. 19, 2017\\n\\nAfter Trump equates anti-racist protesters with self-proclaimed white nationalists and Nazis rallying in Charlottesville, Romney calls for Trump to change his tune.\\n\\nHis apologists strain to explain that he didn't mean what we heard, Romney writes on Facebook, calling it a defining moment for Trump. But what we heard is now the reality, and unless it is addressed by the president as such, with unprecedented candor and strength, there may commence an unraveling of our national fabric.\\n\\nDecember 2017\\n\\nTrump visits Utah for the first time as president, the red state that saw the most significant erosion for the Republican presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. During the visit, Trump goes out of his way to praise Utah Sen. Orrin G.

{"original": "Other new sheriffs were doing much the same. In Mecklenburg and Wake counties, North Carolina's largest jurisdictions, they notified ICE that their offices would no longer participate in the federal program that delegates immigration enforcement to local agencies.\\n\\nThe collective snub was the first move in a looming upheaval in how the state's urban sheriffs do their job. In the fall, all seven of the most populous counties elected African Americans as their top law enforcement officer — not only a reflection of the shifting dynamics here, but a sharp break from the nation's historical pattern of picking white men for the position and then keeping them there in perpetuity.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMost of the stress and the tension with law enforcement comes from the minority community, Birkhead said. Who better to rebuild those relationships than African American law-enforcement executives, and in this case African American sheriffs?\\n\\nAll seven counties have white majorities. Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, is 91 percent white. Yet five of the new sheriffs defeated white incumbents. Another beat the retiring sheriff's white heir apparent. The seventh, Cumberland County's Ennis Wright, was appointed in 2017 to fill a vacancy and faced voters for the first time.\\n\\nAn additional historic mark in November was the election of Paula Dance in Pitt County in the eastern part of the state. She is North Carolina's first black female sheriff.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's wild, said Mirya Holman, a political scientist at Tulane University who co-authored a 2015 report that found that 95 percent of sheriffs in the country were white. That figure, she argued, is no accident.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere's a lot of history of sheriffs being key upholders of racist institutions, Holman noted recently. Sheriffs played key roles in Jim Crow, in enforcing racist laws in the South. They played key roles in instigating race riots in the American Northeast and Midwest, on the West Coast.\\n\\nStill, urban voters have long overlooked the office. In many states, she said, it was only during the 2018 election cycle that organizations that are interested in electing people of color started paying attention to sheriffs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPart of the shift can be traced to the contentious national conversation about how law enforcement treats communities of color — from the Trump administration's policy of deporting immigrants without criminal records to high-profile police beatings and killings of African Americans. In North Carolina, those issues were at the core of several urban sheriffs' races.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, an immigrant-led revolt against the 287(g) immigration enforcement program helped elect Sheriff Garry McFadden. The longtime homicide detective promised to withdraw from the program.\\n\\nIt doesn't keep the community safe, said Oliver Merino, co-founder of the advocacy group Comunidad Colectiva, who helped organize the resistance and campaigned independently for McFadden. Studies by the University of North Carolina's Latino Migration Project and the libertarian Cato Institute have concluded 287(g) erodes trust between immigrants and law enforcement, with little to no evidence the program reduces crime.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Buncombe County, the political mood was reinforced by the videotaped beating in 2017 of an African American jaywalker by Asheville city police. What I heard at the community level is people wanting leaders and law enforcement engaging honestly [and] coming up with concrete solutions around use-of-force issues, said the Rev. Jasmine Beach-Ferrara, a Democratic county commissioner.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBuncombe voters rejected the retiring sheriff's endorsed candidate. They instead chose Quentin Miller, a retired police sergeant who embraced the findings of President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Its report emphasized de-escalation training and urged officers to adopt a guardian — rather than a warrior — mind-set.\\n\\nBut beyond the law-enforcement issues, the sheriff races signal North Carolina's changing demographics. The state has long been purple politically; the governor is a Democrat, but Republicans control the legislature. Assessing the recent electoral outcomes — with the defeat of three Republicans, all seven urban sheriffs are now Democrats — Duke University political scientist Kerry Haynie sees a blue tint in the future.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBlacks and Latinos are becoming an increasingly larger share of the population and the electorate, and that's beginning to have a political effect, he said. This may be a precursor for North Carolina being a battleground in 2020.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDurham County was the scene of one of the most lopsided upsets. Long a cigarette-manufacturing hub, its morning air for decades had a thick, sweet tobacco scent. But the Liggett & Myers factory closed in 2000, and now the county of about 312,000 has a tech-and-health-care economy, two universities and a reputation for liberal activism. Political discussions in Durham, from the courthouse to the coffee shops, often center on racial justice.\\n\\nUntil last month, the sheriff was a white veteran lawman named Mike Andrews, 60. His performance was the topic of many of those discussions.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAndrews faced protests over conditions at the county jail, where nine inmates died since he took office in 2012. (All but one were African American.) Detractors also accused him of grandstanding after he tried to slap felony charges on 12 activists who toppled a Confederate statue in 2017, days after the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe felony charges were completely political, said Durham Mayor Pro Tempore Jillian Johnson. There was no justification.\\n\\nAndrews did not respond to several interview requests.\\n\\nAs in other North Carolina sheriff's races, immigration played a central role here. Andrews routinely honored ICE detainers, requests that inmates be held for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled releases. I'd rather [ICE] come to a single location than to be in our community, causing fear and panic times 10, he told a television reporter in May.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHis office released 87 inmates to ICE last year. That cooperation left many immigrants fearful, particularly in light of the Trump administration's stepped-up enforcement.\\n\\nEnter Birkhead, a 58-year-old former semipro football player who had headed the police forces of Duke University and the nearby town of Hillsborough. He cast himself as a representative of the county's inclusive values — a protector of everyone who's here, regardless of their immigration status — and he pledged not to cooperate with ICE unless legally compelled. Winning the trust of Durham's Latinos, he said, meant distancing himself from a federal agency known for tearing families apart.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf I'm over here cooperating with ICE and facilitating the deportation process, he said in an interview, pointing in one direction before pivoting his body, that's not going to play well when I'm over here trying to build relationships.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBirkhead links his views on immigration to a larger philosophy of encouraging second chances for small-time offenders and concentrating on serious threats to public safety rather than marijuana misdemeanors, for example. There are other issues that need to be addressed, [like] the presence of guns in our neighborhoods, he said.\\n\\nBirkhead built strong relationships before and during his campaign with advocates of criminal justice restructuring and minority communities. He promised regular meetings with immigrant leaders. He would come to every single event that we organized, said Ivan Almonte, a co-founder of the local group Acción Política Latina. He was eating our food. He was sitting with us.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the end, the challenger won endorsements from across the political spectrum. He crushed Andrews in the May Democratic primary with 69 percent of the vote, then racked up 92 percent in November against two write-in candidates.\\n\\nImmigrant leaders say it is a relief to have a sheriff who will not voluntarily cooperate with ICE. Some undocumented immigrants have faced deportation after minor traffic violations, when the officers ticketing them discovered they were driving illegally. North Carolina does not issue licenses to residents without Social Security numbers."}

{"original": "There will be many more such moves to come before teams must be in compliance with the salary cap next month.\\n\\nHere are some of the higher-profile players who potentially could be released:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTony Romo, QB, Cowboys: Dak Prescott is entrenched as the starter in Dallas after a spectacular rookie season in place of the injured Romo. The Cowboys are unlikely to keep Romo as a backup with a contract that counts $24.7 million against the salary cap. Romo wants to move on and be a starter elsewhere and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones probably will accommodate him. The question is whether Jones and the Cowboys will attempt to orchestrate a trade and get something in return, or merely release Romo and hand him total control over picking his next team.\\n\\nJay Cutler, QB, Bears: It's probably time for both sides to move on, and the guaranteed portion of Cutler's seven-year, $126.7 million contract is done. So the Bears would have to carry only $2 million in dead money on their salary cap by releasing Cutler and would save $14 million in cap space.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAdrian Peterson, RB, Vikings: Peterson is to make $18 million in salary and bonuses next season. He turns 32 in March and is coming off an injury-shortened season in which he ran for only 72 yards. It's possible he and the Vikings will work out a revised deal for him to remain in Minnesota. But it's also possible the Vikings instead will opt to part ways and Peterson will be looking for a new team. He already has begun to mull about his next NFL destination publicly.\\n\\nTyrod Taylor, QB, Bills: The Bills have a $15.5 million option in Taylor's contract and must decide if they think he is their long-term answer at quarterback. He has thrown for more than 6,000 yards and 37 touchdowns over the past two seasons, with only 12 interceptions. He also has run for more than 1,100 yards over that two-year span. Perhaps he has not established himself as a franchise quarterback. But he has established himself as a reasonably productive player at the sport's most important position, and the Bills would have to figure out how to find a replacement who would represent an upgrade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nColin Kaepernick, QB, 49ers: Kaepernick can void his contract and become a free agent. If he doesn't do that, the 49ers could opt to release him. Either way, it seems likely that the new regime of General Manager John Lynch and Coach Kyle Shanahan will seek a new beginning at quarterback. The Niners have the second overall selection in the NFL draft and could use it to attempt to put their quarterback of the future in place.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDarrelle Revis, CB, Jets: The Jets are in need of an overhaul and got it under way by cutting ties with Clady. Revis could be next. From there, it will be interesting to see if the Jets also release center Nick Mangold and wide receiver Brandon Marshall.\\n\\nJamaal Charles, RB, Chiefs: The Chiefs would save nearly $6.2 million against the salary cap by releasing him. He is a dynamic player when healthy but he's managed to play in only eight games over the past two seasons.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBranden Albert, T, Dolphins: He is to count $10.6 million against the salary cap. The Dolphins could save $7.2 million in cap room by releasing him and could move Laremy Tunsil, last year's first-round draft choice who mostly played guard as a rookie, to left tackle.\\n\\nMario Williams, DE, Dolphins: He is coming off a 1.5-sack season and the Dolphins would carve out an additional $8.5 million in salary cap space by releasing him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRobert Griffin III, QB, Browns: The Browns could trade for New England Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. They could use one of their two first-round draft picks on a quarterback. A second season in Cleveland for Griffin wouldn't seem to make a lot of sense unless he remains as a backup.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRussell Okung, T, Broncos: The Broncos need help along their offensive line but paying Okung big money for next season and beyond probably is not going to provide enough of it. The team has until March 8 to pick up an option in Okung's contract worth $48 million over the next four seasons.\\n\\nJason Peters, T, Eagles: The Eagles reportedly already have told Peters he must agree to a revised deal to remain in Philadelphia.\\n\\nDoug Martin, RB, Buccaneers: He ran for only 421 yards in eight games this past season, was suspended in December for a violation of the NFL's policy on banned performance-enhancing substances and is to count $7 million against next season's salary cap. Martin is only one season into a five-year, $35.75 million contract signed after he finished second in the NFL in rushing (behind Peterson) in the 2015 season. He could stay in Tampa but it probably would require a reworked contract."}
{"original": "He winds his way through a stump speech with the same inflections and cadences of a Southern preacher. The call-and-response includes melodic repetition of the line Who are we? imploring the audience to answer We, the people. Resting one arm against the lectern while looking off to the side, he delivers rehearsed dad jokes, pleas for voter turnout and broadsides against his political opponent. The preacher sprinkles his calls for affordable health care with biblical allusions, reminding voters that Bartimaeus, a blind man healed by Jesus in the Gospel of Mark, suffered from a preexisting condition. To this point, Warnock testifies on the need for Medicaid expansion and cheaper college tuition. Audience members punctuate the applause lines with cries of C'mon, Rev!\\n\\nFor the past 15 years Warnock has been the senior pastor at the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the same church once led by his hero, Martin Luther King Jr. The flamboyant, preacher-pol style that Warnock cultivated at Ebenezer may be alien to many Americans, including many White Christians. But it is deeply familiar to those who grew up in and around Southern Black churches. In those churches, preachers make it their business to tell uncomfortable truths about American life, including the shameful ways the country treats its African American citizens.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWarnock's identity as a Black preacher has become central to his bid to reach the higher ground of the U.S. Senate. Republicans, who tend to perceive less conflict in the relationship between God and country, have cast him as a dangerous departure from the norm. In a recent debate, a conspicuously scripted Sen. Kelly Loeffler, the Republican incumbent whom Warnock is trying to unseat, called him a radical liberal more than a dozen times. A pro-Loeffler attack ad features a video clip of Warnock warning members of his congregation that they cannot serve God and money, or God and the military, at the same time (Matthew 6:24). The ad is spliced with snippets of Warnock yelling during sermons. Over action-movie-trailer music and lo-fi lighting, a grim-sounding narrator explains the threat Warnock poses to the republic: Raphael Warnock attacks our soldiers. Warnock attacks our police. . . . Raphael Warnock is radical and dangerous.\\n\\nWarnock's style also might be his best asset in the runoff, helping him match the emotional pitch of the moment as Americans suffer through the hardest stretch of the pandemic and President Trump spreads wild conspiracy theories about America's voting system and the officials (including Republicans, and especially Georgia Republicans) who administer it.\\n\\nThere should be more people being so-called 'radical' for change, says Mawuli Davis, an attorney who attends Ebenezer and represented Warnock when he got arrested at the Georgia Capitol in 2014 for protesting the Republican governor's decision not to expand Medicaid under the Obamacare law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat's truly radical, Davis says, is trying to overturn a freaking election.\\n\\nJoe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia, coupled with two runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate, have drawn national attention to the state. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nOn the stage in Albany, Warnock is dressed in a light blue quarter-zip pullover, looking like a suburban dad returning from Home Depot with a bag of mulch. To counter the radical label Warnock has expressed his support for police and the military (his dad was a veteran). In one ad he walks a dog along the sidewalk in front of suburban homes with picket fences. Dogs are more often associated with White ownership.\\n\\nEarly voting numbers indicate high enthusiasm among Democratic-leaning voters such as young people and African Americans — voting blocs Warnock aims to inspire with a vision of change while not alienating moderate voters in the suburbs who helped carry Joe Biden to victory here in November. To paraphrase the apostle Matthew, Warnock may have to serve two masters, electorally speaking. And his success may depend on his identity as a man who serves God.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs the Albany event ends, a man who addressed the crowd earlier wanders among the cars.\\n\\nI think it is important that we have people in politics on the liberal side, on the progressive side, that represent faith, that take back the meaning behind faith, that it is not a conservative ideal, says Alex Moreschi, a White Episcopal minister. At its heart, Christianity is a progressive movement. It is a radical movement for the health and security and love of neighbor. And I see Rev. Warnock representing that.\\n\\nIn Georgia, they worship God. In small, red-brick buildings next to cotton fields. In strip malls next to bargain outlets. In large multimillion-dollar complexes with expansive parking lots, they praise His name. But Georgians do not always worship together. And they do not always receive God's message in the same way. Centuries of racial and social segregation mean that while Black and White may be a part of the same body of Christ, they aren't necessarily in communion with each other.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFor hundreds of years the Black Christian church has been the central religious, social and political institution in Black American life. The church has survived racial acts of terror, including bombings, fires and mass shootings. As recently as December a group of neo-facists marching in D.C. vandalized Black churches displaying Black Lives Matter signs. The most elaborate and well-planned slave insurrection in the history of the United States was organized by Denmark Vesey, the co-founder of Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., according to Vesey biographer David Robertson. Richard H. Cain, who was elected to the House of Representatives during Reconstruction, served as Emanuel's pastor. And the Black church is where a charismatic young preacher from Atlanta plotted a nonviolent overthrow of the racial caste system in the South.\\n\\nI seek to live in a way that honors Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Coretta Scott King and the entire King family. Not just on this special occasion, but every day, Kelly Loeffler reportedly told a congregation last January when she appeared at Ebenezer in honor of King.\\n\\nIt was a thoroughly uncontroversial remark for a modern conservative politician to make — the kind that makes it easy to forget how unpopular King was when he was alive. Gallup polling estimated that Americans felt more negatively toward him as the 1960s progressed. Critics branded King a radical communist hellbent on destroying America, and those accusations continued well after he was killed; President Ronald Reagan initially opposed the proposal to make King's birthday a national holiday, and more than 100 lawmakers in the House and Senate voted against it. In a 1983 debate on the matter, Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) accused King of harboring radical political views rooted in Marxist communism.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKing was not a communist; he criticized communism for denying God. But he was a political radical in his time, promoting peaceful lawbreaking to protest racial injustice — in God's name, no less. And he was unsparing in his criticism of godly men who failed to do the same. Writing from a Birmingham, Ala., jail, in 1963, King expressed his disappointment in White ministers for failing to call out segregation as morally sinful. He also had choice words for White moderates, whom he described as a greater stumbling block to racial justice than even the Ku Klux Klan. (Suffice it to say, King never ran for statewide office in Georgia.)\\n\\nWarnock is not Martin Luther King Jr., but he has borrowed a sheet or two from King's playbook. Warnock speaks of government-backed health care the same way King spoke of ending segregation: This is what God wants us to do.\\n\\nWarnock's attempts to claim the moral high ground haven't sat well with everyone in the Black church. In December, more than two dozen church leaders politely asked him to reconsider his pro-choice views, saying his rationalizations reflected grave errors of judgment and a lapse in pastoral responsibility.(At the same time, those leaders praised his efforts to share Christ while pursuing political solutions to our most pressing problems today.)\\n\\nBut the fact that Warnock has pastoral responsibilities puts him in an unusual strategic position — not just with voters who want to walk a righteous path, but also with respect to the radical liberal attack line from Republicans. In December, the New York Times reported that a different group of religious leaders wrote an open letter to Loeffler, asking her to stop calling Warnock a radical, saying that doing so amounted to a broader attack against the Black Church and faith traditions for which we stand. The pastor's social justice theological and faith traditions, they reportedly wrote, are not only accepted as an authentic prophetic message in the tradition of Dr. Martin Luther King, but also a central message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\\n\\nThe man is not radical, says the Rev. Ralph Huling, senior pastor of St. James Missionary Baptist Church.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is a Sunday morning in Columbus, a city near the Georgia-Alabama line. Covid-19 restrictions have forced the event at St. James into the parking lot, where the amens have been replaced by gratuitous horn-honking.\\n\\nThe man is just a proponent of change, continues Huling. By calling for Medicaid expansion Warnock is simply asking America to live up to its ideals, he explains. If that is radical, says Huling, then we need more radicals.\\n\\nWarnock is fond of telling crowds that Jesus healed the sick, even those with preexisting conditions. He wants college to be cheaper because he went to Morehouse on the full faith scholarship which means he didn't have enough money for the first semester. It works on multiple levels. If you are a progressive hoping for the same policy outcomes, Warnock is speaking your language. If you want someone who understands your culture because he comes from where you come from, that works, too.\\n\\nRaces between Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) and Jon Ossoff (D) as well as Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.) and the Rev. Raphael Warnock (D) will be decided on Jan. 5. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nThe cruel irony of the pandemic is that, in times of social strife, Black people have counted on the comforting rhythms of church life. But on this day there is no clapping from the Amen corner, no church ladies in decorative hats filing in early to grab their favorite seats, no ushers rushing in with fans to cool parishioners who've been overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit. No little girls in their finest dresses scrounging through grandma's purse in search of hard peppermint candies, no little boys negotiating with the serving ladies for an extra piece of fried chicken or another dollop of potato salad after the second sermon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat is, perhaps, why Huling looks particularly excited to be performing in front of a large audience this morning. I didn't come to prolong the time, he says before giving his remarks — a warning to anyone who's spent time in a Black church that they'd better get ready to settle in.\\n\\nWhat follows is a 30-minute stemwinder that starts with O Little Town of Bethlehem and veers to a treatise on the horse trading between President Lyndon Johnson and Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen over the Civil Rights Act. The sermon reaches a singsong crescendo with Huling in an Ozzy Osbourne rock-star crouch screaming into the microphone.\\n\\nHe's a bridge (ah) over troubled water. . . . He's a doctor (ah) in a sickroom. . . . He's a lawyer (ah) in a courtroom. . . . Ain't he all right . . . ?

{"original": "On Tuesday, the two met, and in a turnabout that stunned governors, attorneys general and conservationists in other coastal states, Zinke exempted Florida from his department's dramatic expansion of drilling leases across 90 percent of the U.S. outer continental shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean.\\n\\nNow, governors concerned about drilling and its potential effect on the environment, beaches and tourism industry, which is worth billions of dollars, are asking why Florida is so special and vowing to wage a fight against new drilling, in court if necessary.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nZinke tweeted a statement that offered little explanation, describing Scott a straightforward leader that can be trusted saying that I support the governor's position that Florida is unique and its coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.\\n\\nCalifornia's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, immediately objected. California is also 'unique' and our 'coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver,'  Becerra said in a statement that parroted Zinke. Our 'local and state voice' is firmly opposed to any and all offshore drilling. If that's your standard, we, too, should be removed from your list. Immediately.\\n\\nWhat sets Scott apart from other coastal politicians is his ambition, widely reported by news organizations throughout Florida, to challenge Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and become an ally to President Trump in Congress. It's an option I have, Scott said of running for Nelson's seat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNelson has been as outspoken in his opposition to Atlantic and gulf drilling near Florida as Scott has been silent. The Trump administration's acquiescence to Scott's request was criticized by some as politics, saying it allowed the governor to position himself as a friend of the environment, even as local government officials, planners and environmentalists adamantly say he has never been.\\n\\nBefore January, Scott showed little interest in the developing proposal to drill off Florida's coast. A map handed out by Interior officials in a briefing to congressional staffers on the proposed five-year drilling plan and included in a draft report indicated that the Scott administration formally took no position when asked by Interior in the summer of 2017.\\n\\nA letter to Interior from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in August said the state remains concerned about the drilling proposal, arguing that waters off Florida have high environmental and economic value and are an essential component for developing and sustaining military readiness. But the agency did not explicitly oppose offshore drilling in the letter.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. But now, suddenly, Secretary Zinke announces plans to drill off Florida's coast and four days later agrees to 'take Florida off the table'? Nelson said in a statement Wednesday. I don't believe it. This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott, who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career. We shouldn't be playing politics with the future of Florida.\\n\\nSenator Nelson and anyone else who opposes oil drilling off of Florida's coast should be happy that the governor was able to secure this commitment, Scott spokesman John Tupps said in an email. This isn't about politics. This is good policy for Florida.\\n\\nTrump signs order authorizing offshore oil drilling (The Washington Post)\\n\\nScott's office said the governor raised the issue personally with Zinke during a Capitol Hill meeting in October.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said he doubted Zinke's local voice matters justification for exempting Florida and suggested the agency sided with Scott because the governor is a Trump ally and Florida is home to the president's so-called Winter White House.\\n\\nIs it because the governor of Florida is a Republican and the Virginia governors are Democrats? Kaine said, reprising his role as chief Trump critic as Hillary Clinton's 2016 running mate. Are they putting Florida off-limits because President Trump has a vacation property, Mar-a-Lago, on the Atlantic coast of Florida and he worries about environmental risk there, but he's not worried about environmental risk in Virginia?\\n\\nIn a Wednesday interview with The Washington Post, Zinke said he first met Scott when his state and the federal government were preparing for Hurricane Irma, then a second time when the two worked on Everglades restoration. Zinke said he felt a personal connection with the governor, so when Scott contacted him in writing he felt an obligation to respond.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nQuite frankly, Gov. Scott called me and [also] expressed in writing a desire to have a meeting, he said. That meeting was the first in what I believe will be a series of conversations with other governors, the secretary said. I will no doubt talk to every governor. It doesn't matter to me whether you're Republican or Democrat. This is going to be a long process. This is going to be at least a year with public comment. We have to get it right, look at the geology, look at the science.\\n\\nTrump's proposal to expand drilling across the entire outer continental shelf comes less than eight years after one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history, the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion that killed 11 people and spilled 215 million gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico, fouling beaches from Louisiana to Florida.\\n\\nIn a statement thanking Zinke for safeguarding Florida from potential oil spills, Scott proclaimed that I will never stop fighting for Florida's environment and our pristine coastline. Meanwhile, environmentalists are counting down his final days in office, hoping the next governor will be a stronger environmental steward.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Hurricane Irma bore down on Florida last fall, local officials, academics and even some of Scott's political allies noted how his administration did little to prepare for the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise in a state with one of the nation's longest coastlines.\\n\\nIt's more than an absence of leadership. There's harm being done by denying the problem, said Eric Buermann, former general counsel to the Republican Party of Florida and a former board chairman for the South Florida Water Management District. He's chilled the discussion, so that those who would want to do something about it feel ostracized. . . . I'm a Republican. He's a Republican. He's a nice guy. There's nothing negative I have to say about the human being. It's just that the policy is 180 degrees off course.\\n\\nState newspapers have reported that early in his administration, Scott discouraged the use of words such as climate change and global warming in official state documents, accusations that the governor denies.\\n\\nUntil Zinke gifted Scott with a key talking point about his stewardship, Scott had few environmental accomplishments other than a grant to help restore the Everglades.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAs Zinke said, beach tourism on the coast drives Florida's economy, but the same is true of Maryland and Virginia, where Ocean City and Virginia Beach are major tourist draws. And the Chesapeake Bay, the largest freshwater estuary in the United States that flows to the Atlantic, drives the economies of both states.\\n\\nBeaches line the Atlantic coast like a string of pearls: Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head in South Carolina, the Outer Banks of North Carolina, Bethany Beach in Delaware, Atlantic City and its surrounding areas in New Jersey, Jones Beach on Long Island in New York and Martha's Vineyard off Massachusetts.\\n\\nSingling out Florida while rejecting identical requests for exclusion from North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and the entire West Coast violates federal law, said Sierra Weaver, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. She cited the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Administrative Procedure Act that govern the development of the offshore leasing program, saying they define a specific process that the Interior Department must follow and standards it must apply in making such a decision.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf he made an exception for Governor Scott, I'm wondering if he's going to make an exception for the new governor of New Jersey, or the governor of Virginia, or the governor of Delaware, said House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who criticized Zinke's decision, saying it appeared to be a politically motivated.\\n\\nWhat's good for the goose is good for the gander. The bottom line is that that order is very, very controversial, Hoyer said. It's going to be I think a very, very political, patently political, swamp political, to do something for the governor of Florida — who's a Republican — and not do something for governors who have similar concerns.\\n\\nMany of the other Atlantic coast governors who oppose drilling are Republican. Along with Scott, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, all conservatives, have all stated their opposition.\\n\\nA Zinke spokeswoman, Heather Swift, said she's unaware of any official scheduling requests that have come to the department from other governors at this time, but some could have come in overnight.\\n\\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper (D) said that's not for lack of trying. Rather than provide a comment, his spokesman pointed out two tweets from Cooper indicating that he reached out to Zinke for a meeting in recent days and reaffirming his opposition to drilling.\\n\\nBefore Zinke met with Scott, Hogan threatened legal action, according to his spokesman. Protecting our environment and precious natural resources is a top priority for Governor Hogan and exactly why he has made clear that he opposes this kind of exploration off our coastline, said spokesman Douglass Mayer. Hogan directed his attorney general to take any legal action necessary against the federal government to prevent this possible exploration, Mayer said."}

This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.\\n\\nGreitens, 43, is a relatively new star in the Republican Party who boasts an extraordinary résumé: Former Navy SEAL and Lt. Commander, attended Duke University on scholarship; Rhodes scholar at Oxford; PhD, author and White House Fellow during the administration of President George W. Bush. He is the author of Resilience: Hard-Won Wisdom for Living a Better Life and, according to a profile in St. Louis Magazine, has had presidential aspirations since he was a young man. His wife, Sheena Chestnut Greitens, is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Missouri, and a nonresident senior fellow at the Center for East Asian Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\\n\\nA Democrat-turned-Republican, Greitens was elected governor in November 2016 after a campaign that emphasized his status as a family man.

Eric Greitens (R) ran a television commercial featuring him with an assault rifle during the 2016 campaign. (Eric Greitens)\\n\\nThe governor had just delivered his state-of-the-state address Wednesday when KMOV in St. Louis broke the story about his affair with his former hairdresser in 2015.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe extramarital relationship itself, however, may have been the least explosive part of the story.\\n\\nMore unusual was what she purportedly said in a recording made surreptitiously by the woman's jealous ex-husband, which the station played.\\n\\nIn it, she can be heard telling how Greitens invited her to his home in 2015. Once she arrived, he told her he would show her how to do pullups, taped her hands to exercise rings and blindfolded her, all with her consent.\\n\\nThen, to her shock, she alleged, he snapped photographs of her naked and threatened to distribute the pictures if she revealed the relationship.\\n\\nOn what was supposed to be a banner evening for Greitens, he then was forced to issue the statement with his wife confirming the affair. His wife also issued her own statement:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe have a loving marriage and an awesome family; anything beyond that is between us and God. I want the media and those who wish to peddle gossip to stay away from me and my children.\\n\\nNeither the governor or his wife said anything about the reported photo shoot or the alleged blackmail threat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat came in a separate statement by the couple's attorney, Bennett, who denied the blackmail claim. There was no 'blackmail,'  lawyer Bennett said in a written statement, and that claim is false . . . The outrageous claims of improper contact regarding these almost three-year-ago events are a lie.\\n\\nThe whole story, which had been the stuff of wild rumors for weeks, originated with the spurned ex-husband, who told KMOV that the relationship between Greitens and the man's then-wife had led to the breakup of their marriage.\\n\\nAfterward, the ex-husband went on social media calling Greitens a homewrecker, according to KMOV. He then tried to go public with his story and with the recording, speaking with both of Missouri's major newspapers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Kansas City Star reported that they too had possession of a transcript of the surreptitious recording and had interviewed the ex-husband. Both papers said they had decided against writing a story because the woman declined to be interviewed. Once the governor released a public statement the papers pushed ahead with their stories.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKMOV decided otherwise. Although it said it had no on-the-record-comment from the woman, it went with the story Wednesday night under the headline Blackmail alleged as Governor Greitens admits to extramarital affair and took credit for prompting Greitens's statement.\\n\\nI am not after anything, the ex-husband, who was also unnamed, told KMOV. I am not a part of politics. I am not a part of anything. I just want to move on with my life.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe claimed to have been contacted by law enforcement authorities as well as members of the media.\\n\\nBennett, Greitens's lawyer, said in his statement that there was nothing about the relationship that has generated or should generate law enforcement interest.\\n\\nGreitens has received mixed reviews in as governor. While campaigning on a platform of cleaning up government, he admitted to the Missouri Ethics Commission that he had violated campaign finance law, according to the Kansas City Star. He was fined $1,000. He and his senior staff have also come under fire for using an app that deletes text messages after they've been read, raising concerns about trying to subvert Missouri open records law.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nComments posted on Greitens's Facebook page reflected a mixed reaction to the Wednesday's revelations.\\n\\nThis was March of 2015, wrote one woman, most likely when your wife was pregnant or had a new baby. There are transcripts. What is so fraudulent is that Eric Greitens ran as a 'family man.' \\n\\nThere are many in Missouri who stand behind you as governor, wrote another, and support your family . . . Lead on and God Bless!\\n\\nHere is the full statement, as posted on Facebook, by Greitens and his wife and the couple's lawyer:\\n\\nI wanted to share with you some statements that are important in light of news you may have seen tonight. A statement from James F. Bennett, our attorney: The Governor has now seen the TV report that ran tonight. The station declined to provide the tape or transcript in advance of running their story, which contained multiple false allegations. The claim that this nearly three-year old story has generated or should generate law enforcement interest is completely false. There was no 'blackmail,' and that claim is false. This personal matter has been addressed by the Governor and Mrs. Greitens privately years ago when it happened. The outrageous claims of improper conduct regarding these almost three-year-ago events are a lie. Joint statement from Sheena and I: A few years ago, before Eric was elected governor, there was a time when he was unfaithful in our marriage. This was a deeply personal mistake. Eric took responsibility, and we dealt with this together honestly and privately.

{"original": "To this point, no agency has been inhibited in response efforts due to resources or authorities. However, much is still unknown about this virus and the disease it causes, acting White House Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought wrote to congressional leaders. The administration believes additional federal resources are necessary to take steps to prepare for a potential worsening of the situation in the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe request reflects the fast-evolving nature of the crisis confronting the administration, which until recently had insisted that no additional funds were necessary.\\n\\nBut Democrats immediately slammed the request as too small, with House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-N.Y.) calling it woefully insufficient to protect Americans and criticizing the administration for trying to raid money from other public health accounts.\\n\\nHouse Democrats will move quickly to enact a robust package that fully addresses this global emergency without allowing this administration to steal from other necessary programs, Lowey said.\\n\\nThe request comes after federal agencies quickly burned through a $100 million fund and worked to transfer an additional $136 million from other accounts. Overall, the administration said in its request Monday that it intends to spend at least $2.5 billion to respond to the coronavirus, counting existing funds and transfers from other accounts.\\n\\nThe new funding would be spent on all aspects of a response to the virus, including lab tests and quarantine costs, vaccine research and development, public health preparedness, and support for affected states.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House released the request at the end of a day when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,000 points as worldwide fears set in that the coronavirus outbreak could last much longer than initially thought. Large parts of China's economy have effectively shut down because of the outbreak, and the virus has spread to more than two dozen other countries, with new cases in South Korea and Italy popping up over the weekend.\\n\\nThe number of cases of coronavirus in the United States now stands at nearly five dozen, a figure that greatly increased when infected passengers were brought back from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked in Japan. The federal government has had to scramble in recent weeks to adjust, and the White House's coronavirus response has been uneven, with President Trump recently expressing anger that he was not involved in more decisions. While traveling in India on Monday, Trump declared on Twitter that the coronavirus is very much under control in the United States and that the stock market was looking good.\\n\\nWhite House officials initially said they had little concern about the effect of the coronavirus on the United States, but that stance has changed markedly in recent weeks. They have placed certain people in quarantine and are blocking many foreign-born people trying to enter the United States.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSenior White House officials, alarmed by gaps in the U.S. supply chain for responding to the coronavirus, have also begun studying potential measures to improve the United States' capacity for producing drugs and necessary medical equipment. This month, as the outbreak accelerated, a team of White House officials traveled to the Virginia Biotechnology Research Park in Richmond for a tour of a facility piloting the production of generic pharmaceuticals.\\n\\nThe administration is looking at potential unilateral actions to strengthen Buy American provisions that would require federal agencies such as Health and Human Services, the Defense Department, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to buy drugs and other medical equipment from facilities in the United States. White House officials are also interested in speeding up the production of advanced pharmaceuticals, although exactly how they would do so is not clear.\\n\\nThe administration's response to the coronavirus is being led by a task force helmed by HHS Secretary Alex Azar and national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien. Some senior White House officials are wary of relying too heavily on producers abroad to ensure that the United States has enough medical and pharmaceutical supplies to respond to the outbreak should it expand here.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf we have learned anything from the coronavirus and swine flu H1N1 epidemic of 2009, it is that we cannot necessarily depend on other countries, even close allies, to supply us with needed items, from face masks to vaccines, said Peter Navarro, a senior White House adviser on trade and manufacturing policy.\\n\\nToday, as the coronavirus situation underscores, too many of our supply chains for essential medicines and medical countermeasures are offshore.\\n\\nOn Monday, groups representing state and local public health officials urged the administration to pass emergency funding to support front-line work, which includes 3,000 local health departments.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith no vaccines likely to be ready in the next several months, it will be up to public health agencies to identify, quarantine and monitor people at high and medium risk for developing covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus; isolate and test those with symptoms; and quickly identify potential cases.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStates' immediate needs include:\\n\\nTesting and monitoring patients who are being evaluated for possible coronavirus infections;\\n\\nPurchasing personal protective equipment;\\n\\nOutreach to the general public; and\\n\\nMedical transport and hospitalization for uninsured and underinsured people with symptoms for medical evaluation.\\n\\nIn a letter to Trump, the groups said that while it is too early to reliably predict the additional costs and needs of a covid-19 response, the administration should act quickly so that sufficient funds could be appropriated to stay ahead of the curve and perhaps pursue a strategy to enact multiple appropriations on an as-needed basis as the situation unfolds."}
{"original": "The measure has been met with howls of indignation from critics who suggest that coaxing corporations to diversify their boardrooms heralds a mortal threat to capitalism. What nonsense.\\n\\nMany Western European countries, including Britain, Germany and Norway, expect or require far more gender diversity in corporate governance than Nasdaq envisions. Major investment banks and institutional investors not known for their hostility to capitalism — Goldman Sachs, BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors among them — are already pushing companies to break the mold of monochromatic male networks that dominate company boards.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's about time. Three-quarters of Nasdaq's members do not meet the inclusion criteria it has proposed. Other exchanges aren't much more diverse: About 70 percent of the S&P 500 firms do not have a single Black director on their boards. And Nasdaq proposes no harsher sanction for noncompliant firms than that they explain their failure to diversify — a form of naming and shaming.\\n\\nThe standard rejoinder is that publicly listed corporations are obligated to their shareholders to use qualifications and expertise, not other criteria, when selecting directors. That assumes that fresh perspectives and insights into non-White, non-male and nontraditional gender identity communities (not to mention markets) are irrelevant to corporate performance, or that qualified women and minorities don't exist. The same so-called pipeline problem was used to exclude women and minorities from entry-level, journeyman and executive jobs alike in most U.S. workplaces — including newsrooms — for decades. The stated policy of hiring only the best qualified, as defined by White male managers, inevitably produced job forces dominated by White males.\\n\\nProof that firms, when motivated, can quickly diversify their boards came following the death of George Floyd last spring, when many companies publicly pledged to promote racial equity. In the past five months, more than 30 firms on the S&P 500 added a Black director to boards that had none. Perhaps some were also prodded by studies suggesting that diversifying boards yields better corporate financial performance and, as Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon put it, reduces . . . groupthink.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNasdaq, which has submitted its proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is following the example of California, which requires firms based there to have at least one female director and, by 2023, one minority. That's a step forward but no guarantee of immediate change. In Norway, which since 2008 has mandated that women compose 40 percent of corporate boards, a 2014 study found no improvement in firms' gender wage gaps or women promoted to senior executive ranks.\\n\\nProgress in diversifying boardrooms, along with workplaces generally, has been evolutionary. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned employment discrimination, was attacked at the time as radical overreach. Today, it's bedrock employment law — a common-sense baseline. The Nasdaq measure, once approved, should be similarly regarded.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD"}

{"original": "It would interfere with the enforcement of perfectly legitimate foreign orders, just because the foreign country uses trials before judges rather than jury trials. It would require Montana courts to ignore foreign divorces from certain countries, even when the divorces took place decades ago, before any of the affected parties came to Montana.\\n\\nI doubt that this is what the author of the bill (state senator Keith Regier) intends, but it's what the bill, as written, is likely to do.\\n\\nFirst, the relevant text:\\n\\nA court … decision violates the public policy of Montana and is void and unenforceable if … [based] on a law, legal code, or system that would not grant the parties affected by the ruling or decision the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the Montana constitution or the United States constitution, including but not limited to due process, equal protection, freedom of religion, speech, or press, the right to keep and bear arms, and any right of privacy or marriage…. Without prejudice to any legal right, this act does not apply to a person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, business association, or other legal entity that contracts to subject itself to foreign law in a jurisdiction other than this state or the United States.\\n\\nNow, consider two scenarios:\\n\\nAD\\n\\n1. Say Mike Montanan sues Carl Canadian for some tort. Maybe Mike and Carl had a business dispute, and Mike gets a $1 million verdict against Carl for fraud. Mike gets that verdict in Canadian court, because that's where Carl lives, and where the dispute took place. So far, no problem; these sorts of transnational lawsuits are pretty common.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow the Canadian court sits without a jury, because Canadian courts, like the courts of many countries, often do that. That's not the way we generally do things, but Mike is suing a Canadian in Canada, so he gets a verdict under Canadian procedures. Again, so far no problem.\\n\\nBut now Carl moves to Montana, together with his assets. Mike thinks that's fine — he can just collect the assets in Montana. Yet if SB97 is enacted, that couldn't be done. After all, the right to civil trial by jury is a fundamental right under the Montana Constitution. The Canadian court decision in Mike Montanan's favor thus violates the public policy of Montana and is void and unenforceable, because it's based on a law, legal code, or system that would not grant the parties affected by the ruling or decision the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the Montana constitution (the right to trial by civil jury). Mike has to go back into Montana court and sue Carl again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2. Or say that Connie Canadian sues Mary Montanan in Canadian court; assume that the Canadian court has jurisdiction, because this stems from an incident that happened when Mary was doing business in Canada. But Mary wins, again in a trial before a judge, since a jury was unavailable in this proceeding in Canada. I'm done with all that trouble and expense, Mary thinks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Connie now sues Mary again in Montana. Wait, Mary says to the court, I have a verdict in my favor from the Canadian court; throw Connie's case out. But remember that Canadian courts don't allow parties a fundamental right provided by the Montana constitution — under SB97, then, the Canadian verdict would be void. Connie gets to relitigate the case against Mary in Montana, and Mary has to pay her lawyers again (and run the risk of losing again), even though before SB97 she'd have been done with the case once she won in Canada.\\n\\nNow all this might be fine if the foreign system allowed judgments that violate Americans' free speech rights; but a federal statute already largely precludes the enforcement of such judgments. Or it might be fine if the foreign system discriminated against litigants based on race or sex or religion, or if it was fundamentally corrupt. But this is Canada, a civilized country. Much as American law respects the right to trial by jury, does it really make sense to refuse to enforce Canadian judgments (or English or French or German judgments), just because we have a somewhat different system of civil procedure?\\n\\nAD\\n\\n3. Let's move from tort law to family law. Say that Wanda married Xavier in Elbonia, then divorced him in Elbonia. Then she married Harry in Elbonia, and 10 years later came to America.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNow she gets involved in a legal dispute that requires the American legal system to decide whether Wanda is indeed properly married to Harry. Maybe this is relevant to deciding whether Wanda can refuse to testify against Harry, or can file a joint tax return with Harry, or inherits property when Harry dies. To figure out whether the marriage is valid, Montana courts would likely need to figure out if Wanda's earlier Elbonian divorce was valid (since, if it was invalid, Wanda's marriage with Harry is bigamous). And that can only be determined using Elbonian law.\\n\\nBut what if the Elbonian legal system doesn't take the same view of various rights, including equality rights, that the United States now takes? What if, for instance, Elbonian law provides husbands more rights than wives in initiating divorces?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOr what if Elbonia — like Israel, Lebanon, India, and other places — provides that family law matters are to be resolved under the religious laws of the religious group to which the parties belong, which necessarily involves a form of religious discrimination that would violate First Amendment principles if done in the United States? Or what if Elbonian rules of evidence give more weight to men's testimony or to the testimony of people who belong to certain religions, and those rules had been applied in the divorce?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis might be bad, but it's the reality under which Elbonian law operates. Wanda has lived her life in Elbonia based on that reality. She may have remarried based on the effect of the divorce, however unfairly her divorce proceedings may have been conducted. She may have gotten certain property in the divorce, perhaps less than she should have gotten, but something that she now views as hers. That was life on the ground in Elbonia for her.\\n\\nBut if SB97 is enacted, the Elbonian divorce must be ignored, because it was entered under a legal system that denied the fundamental liberties, rights, and privileges granted under the Montana constitution or the United States constitution, such as equal rights regardless of sex, or the First Amendment right not to be treated differently based on religion. The divorce decree would therefore be void, and thus couldn't be considered by American courts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd Wanda would thus be treated as still married to Xavier (whom she had divorced under Elbonian law many years ago), and not to Harry. At best, she would considered Harry's putative spouse, which means she'd be treated as Harry's wife for this dispute — but would lose that status the moment the court informs her that her Elbonian divorce is invalid. She would have to somehow redivorce Xavier under Montana law, though he's still back in Elbonia, and then remarry Harry.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDoes that make sense? To be sure, in some circumstances, it might be proper for courts to ignore the effect of foreign divorces that are based on procedures that U.S. law views as improper. For instance, American courts might reject application of foreign law that they see as unfair when it affects the rights of people who were U.S. residents at the time of the divorce. Likewise, American courts may want to apply American norms to child custody rights when the children are living in the United States. But outside these special circumstances, courts shouldn't categorically ignore the effect of foreign divorces that involve departures from American equality norms.\\n\\nI agree that American courts should in some situations refuse to enforce foreign judgments that are inconsistent with American norms; the federal SPEECH Act, for instance, rightly bars the enforcement in the United States of foreign libel judgments that are based on libel rules that are inconsistent with U.S. free speech protections. Many courts have already incorporated such principles through their own decisions. And there is plenty of flexibility for courts to refuse to enforce judgments that are seen as against American public policy."}
{"original": "During Trump's surprise appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday afternoon, he again turned on the charm, offering Pelosi congratulations on her very, very great achievement of becoming House speaker again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHopefully we're going to work together and get lots of things done, like infrastructure, he said. I think it will be a little bit different than people think.\\n\\nIt's not as if Pelosi has been easy on Trump. At a private meeting after their now-infamous Oval Office meeting last month, she allegedly commented that the border wall must be a manhood thing for Trump. Yet even that insult did not invoke a Twitter tirade from the president. He has slammed Democrats generally for not giving him funding for the wall, but he hasn't gone after Pelosi personally.\\n\\nPelosi wields tremendous power over Trump. As speaker, she has say over investigations and subpoenas and would ultimately be the one to bring impeachment charges to the floor if it came to that. She even said Thursday the president's not immune from indictment. Maybe Trump is playing nice because he knows that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOr maybe he genuinely likes her. (He did tell her, way back in 2011, that she was the best.)\\n\\nIf Trump respects power above all else, as it seems he does, it's not surprising he'd respect Pelosi.\\n\\nWhile we're not privy to Pelosi's skills behind the scenes, the way she navigated her march back to being speaker is an indication of her talents.\\n\\nPelosi told Elle magazine in a recent interview that she views the vitriol thrown her way by Republicans and some Democrats not as hatred but as respect.\\n\\nThey wouldn't come after me if I were not effective. I consider myself a master legislator. Republicans fear me for that, but also because I am a successful fundraiser, enabling our candidates to have the resources they need to win, she said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe persistent anti-Pelosi campaign devised by the Republicans over the years had been successful in adversely affecting public perception of her. Not only did she become the personification of everything Republicans were supposed to fear, but she became a third rail for some within her own party. Over time, Democratic candidates distanced themselves from her. Asking a candidate whether they would support her for speaker became an ultimate gotcha question.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Pelosi worked diligently and strategically after the Democrats won the House majority in the November midterms to shore up support from the varying factions that could have opposed her.\\n\\nTo counter a challenge from Rep. Marcia L. Fudge (D-Ohio), a former Congressional Black Caucus chairwoman, Pelosi promoted a new diversity-hiring office and offered Fudge a job overseeing a resurrected subcommittee on elections. She appealed to progressives by creating a committee focused on climate change.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPelosi's greatest opposition has come from her right flank, from members who said they wanted fresh blood in the leadership role and are from swing districts where backing Pelosi is a liability. She assuaged many of those members by agreeing to implement term limits on party leaders in the House.\\n\\nAfter all the drama surrounding her bid to become speaker, she ultimately lost just 15 Democratic votes, mostly from freshman lawmakers who promised on the campaign trail to oppose her."}
{"original": "Choi took advantage of her long-running, private ties with Park, Judge Kim Se-yoon said, to force big South Korean companies such as Samsung to give donations to two foundations, which were meant to be used to encourage sports but were instead slush funds for Park and Choi.\\n\\n\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn light of the size of material gains obtained by the accused, the severe confusion in state affairs caused by her crimes and the people's sense of frustration, the guilt of the accused is very heavy, the judge said, according to reports from inside the packed courtroom.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChoi, 62, has been friends with Park for about four decades. Choi's father, a kind of shaman-fortune teller, was close to Park's father, Park Chung-hee, who served as South Korea's strongman president from 1963 until he was fatally shot by his own spy chief in 1979.\\n\\nAfter Park's mother was assassinated in 1974, the shaman reportedly began conveying to Park messages from her mother in the afterlife. This led U.S. diplomats in Seoul to call him a Korean Rasputin, according to a leaked U.S. State Department cable.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen Choi's father died in 1994, she apparently took over his role of providing spiritual advice to Park, who was estranged from her siblings.\\n\\nTheir relationship grew closer as Park rose through the political ranks.\\n\\nOnce Park became president, Choi — who held no official role or security clearance — was involved in matters ranging from the presidential wardrobe to international policy speeches.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll the while, Choi allegedly sought donations for her foundations from the big companies that form the backbone of South Korea's economy and continue to have cozy ties to government authorities.\\n\\nPark's presidential Blue House was the main agent in setting up bogus foundations to accept donations from big businesses, the court said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe court found that Choi had forced about 50 businesses to pay a total of $71 million to the two foundations.\\n\\nProsecutors had sought a 25-year prison sentence and a $109 million fine. The court gave Choi, who had pleaded not guilty, a lighter sentence. But her lawyers complained that it still bordered on cruelty and vowed to appeal.\\n\\nChoi did not betray any emotion after the sentence was read, and she left courtroom quietly, according to media reports.\\n\\nSamsung, South Korea's largest conglomerate, was the company most involved in Choi's scheme.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLee Jae-yong, the de facto head of Samsung, was convicted in July of paying bribes totaling $6.4 million to Choi, embezzling corporate money to fund the bribes, then lying about it. He and other Samsung executives were accused of promising to pay $30 million more in bribes to Choi.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLee was sentenced to five years in prison, but a South Korean appeals court last week freed him only six months into his term.\\n\\nHis charges related to allegations that Samsung had paid money to Choi on the understanding that she would make sure the conglomerate won regulatory approval for a huge merger that was crucial for the Lee family's efforts to keep control of the group.\\n\\nLee's release last week notwithstanding, others involved in Choi's scheme have been sentenced to time behind bars.\\n\\nShin Dong-bin, chairman of Lotte Group, South Korea's fifth-largest conglomerate, was sentenced Tuesday to 2½ years in prison. He was convicted of paying about $7 million to Choi's foundations to win approval for a license for Lotte's duty-free business.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe situation was unexpected, and we are in despair, Lotte said in a statement. We respect the court's decision, but the result is very regrettable.\\n\\nA senior adviser to Park was also sentenced to jail Tuesday. An Chong-bum, who was senior presidential secretary for policy coordination, received a six-year sentence and a $92,000 fine for his involvement in Choi's influence-peddling scheme.\\n\\nAll eyes are now on Park, the disgraced former president.\\n\\nAfter months of huge protests at the end of 2016 and beginning of 2017, Park was impeached in March last year. She was arrested soon afterward and has been in detention ever since, complaining vigorously about the conditions in her prison cell.\\n\\nAD"}
{"original": "Blaustein, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, has concerns about leaving home that are heightened by the amount of time away. They include what to do about his mail, home security and beloved tuxedo cat, Abbie.\\n\\nWe have a friend who comes in twice a day to feed her and show her some love, he says. It's hard to be away from the cat for five weeks, but we have to live our life while we can. Right?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome travelers are pushing the limits even farther than Blaustein, particularly as the pandemic frees them up to work remotely. They're crossing national borders, staying on the road for months at a time. Sometimes it's for pleasure, sometimes for business.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLong trips may look easy, but they can be difficult.\\n\\nIt's a lot of work, says Marie Helweg-Larsen, a psychology professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. She's abroad for two years while she directs Dickinson's science study abroad program. She says the logistics of a long trip can be daunting, in big and small ways.\\n\\nI asked long-term travelers how they prepared for a marathon trip, from obtaining the right credit card to dealing with all of their worldly possessions. Their insights might help you plan your next vacation, no matter how long it is. They certainly helped me before I left for an open-ended trip to Europe shortly before the onset of the pandemic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBanking and credit cards: Helweg-Larsen says one of her biggest challenges was navigating the banking system overseas. Because I suspended my U.S. phone number, I couldn't receive text messages to verify purchases from my bank, she says. And my bank doesn't let me use the app as a verification tool.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe considered several credit card options, including getting a card that doesn't require a U.S. address and using Apple Wallet for her purchases. Her solution was a borderless account with TransferWise, an online money-transfer service. (Note: If you decide to keep your American credit card, ask about foreign exchange fees, which are usually 3 percent of the purchase price. If your card has a fee, consider switching to one with no foreign transaction fees before you leave.)\\n\\nInsurance: You'll need it. U.S. health insurance generally doesn't cover routine care while abroad. And if you have a medical condition, you may have to pay out of pocket for a doctor or hospital visit. Tom Wahlin, who traveled internationally for a year, shopped around before finding a policy through Aetna International that cost less than conventional health insurance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis particular plan required me to be out of the U.S. for about 11 months out of the year, says Wahlin, who founded a travel gear site called Pack Hacker.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther travelers buy an annual travel insurance policy, which can cover such events as trip interruption and lost luggage. You can find policies through companies like Allianz or Travel Guard. Consider medical evacuation coverage, too.\\n\\nMail: Keep your U.S. address, advises Zachary Stafford, a professional housesitter who has been traveling the world for the past five years. You can sign up for a service such as PostScan Mail or iPostal1, which receive your mail and forward it to you or scan your mail and send you an email with the image of the outside of each item. They can also provide check-cashing services.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSecurity: If you keep your house or apartment, home security is a serious concern. Blaustein, whose home was burglarized a few years ago, has installed an alarm with multiple cameras. He monitors the cameras remotely while away. His cat-sitter shows up twice a day to check the home, too.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThat takes care of the inside, Blaustein says. But because roof snow is also a huge problem in this part of the world, I have a camera aimed at the roof, so I can assess how deep the snow is and have it raked before it results in ice dams, he says.\\n\\nBlaustein also monitors the driveway with cameras to make sure the plowing service keeps his driveway clear. Note that some homeowner policies don't cover houses vacant for more than 30 days, so you may need a new insurance policy unless someone is living in the home while you're away.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVisas: Permission to stay in a country can be tricky, particularly if you aspire to the global nomad lifestyle. For example, you can't stay in Western Europe's Schengen area — which comprises 26 countries, including France, Germany and Spain — for more than three months before you need a long-stay visa.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe easiest solution is to leave the country for a period of time and then reenter. That's what Kristin Jaffe does. She is a Virtuoso-affiliated travel adviser who has lived abroad for a year. I often enter on a tourist visa, she says. If I plan to stay longer than allowed — which is normally 30 to 90 days, depending on the country — I have had to leave the country and reenter on a new tourist visa, she says.\\n\\nSome countries have strict rules about reentry, so be sure to check before you try this strategy. You might be better off moving to a new location.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nVoting: If you will be away during an election, sign up for an absentee ballot before you leave. If you're already abroad, you can register to vote and request an absentee ballot through the Federal Post Card Application.\\n\\nYour stuff: If you're traveling for a few months, lend your car to a friend or relative. If you're going to be away much longer, get rid of it. At least that's the advice of James Kell, the founder of a sailing school who is on a multiyear sabbatical. Don't put your car in long-term storage. Sell it, he says. That applies to all of your belongings. If you're in doubt about whether you should sell something or not, sell it, he says. Reduce everything you own.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI had to make difficult decisions about all these issues before I embarked on an open-ended trip around the world, which alas, the pandemic cut short. And Helweg-Larsen is right — it's difficult. I sold almost everything I owned, including my house and car. The hardest part: saying goodbye to my three Bengal cats. I found a home for them with a caring family and have visited them several times since then. I miss them.\\n\\nExtreme travelers have a lot to teach infrequent vacationers. Carry the right credit card. Make sure your insurance and paperwork are in order. And, of course, travel light."}
{"original": "As all of that is going on back in Washington, Trump will be headed to the southern border on Thursday to meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis, according to a tweet from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis week, House Democrats will vote on four separate appropriations bills, starting with funding the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service. The longer the shutdown goes, the greater the chance that Americans' tax refunds will be delayed. The Democrats' gambit here is that Republicans won't be able to explain to their voters why they couldn't reopen the IRS to ensure the on-time delivery of refund checks, which is unrelated to the fight over border security.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the Senate, some Democrats are floating an idea to block all business until Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) agrees to take up the House-passed appropriations bills. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) broached the plan that now has support from several prominent Democrats.\\n\\nThe idea, Van Hollen told Washington Post opinion writer Greg Sargent, is gaining traction in the Democratic caucus and from outside groups. The AFL-CIO endorsed it Monday morning. Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) came out in support of it in the afternoon.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the entire caucus adopted the strategy as a united front, it could force McConnell's hand because he'd be unable to get anything else accomplished. This plan would require Democrats to play the kind of hardball more commonly employed by Republicans. It's unclear whether they have the stomach for it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it might be all they've got. As of now, McConnell has given no indication that he will bring up the clean funding bills unless Trump indicates he'll sign them. Remember, though, that before the holidays, McConnell's Senate overwhelmingly passed a clean spending bill to keep the government running through Feb. 8 but was then rolled by the president, who decided after the fact that he couldn't support it. McConnell's spokesman, Don Stewart, told the Fix that without assurance from the president that he'll sign it, McConnell's not going to take shell votes for the sake of shell votes.\\n\\nOver the weekend, talks between congressional leaders and the White House remained at a stalemate. Democrats scoffed at the Trump administration's offer of making the wall out of steel instead of concrete. Administration officials tried to sweeten the deal for Democrats by proposing an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs at the border.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut it's going to become increasingly difficult for the White House to defend using key parts of the federal government as a bargaining chip to negotiate complex immigration policy that has evaded Washington for years. Trump's visit to the border will be a Hail Mary as he tries to convince the American public that holding out for a border wall is worth holding the federal government hostage."}
{"original": "The president's statement offered the latest illustration of the dramatic gyrations that have characterized his foreign policy and fueled questions about whether his senior advisers are implementing his policies or pursuing their own agendas.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe president's order last month to withdraw troops from Syria, which prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, had already exposed a stark gap between Bolton's plan to use the country as a theater to push back against Iran and the president's eagerness to wash his hands of the war.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCritics say the shifting plan, which has rattled key U.S. allies, will embolden Russia and Iran, the Syrian government's main foreign supporters. It also sets the stage for a confrontation between NATO ally Turkey and Kurdish-dominated Syrian forces that have been the chief U.S. partner against the Islamic State.\\n\\nTrump, during wide-ranging comments alongside Cabinet officials Wednesday, reiterated his intent to exit Syria as military officials scrambled to arrange a departure for the more than 2,000 troops there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday, Bolton discussed plans to hand the Islamic State mission over to Turkish forces with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a meeting at the Pentagon.\\n\\nMilitary officials have voiced deep reservations about the speedy departure at a moment when the extremists, though severely weakened, remain a potent threat and Turkey continues to prioritize its fight against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it considers part of a Kurdish terrorist group, over the battle against the Islamic State.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSenior officials are expected to gather at the White House in coming days to decide what support the United States might provide to Turkish forces and to the SDF. Early next week, Bolton and Dunford will visit Turkey to discuss the transition plans with leaders there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAbsent from the discussions in Washington, U.S. officials familiar with Syria policy said, is the Iran-centric plan that Bolton and Pompeo unveiled in the fall. Officials attributed that to the fact the president never signed off on an expanded U.S. mission in Syria to counter Iran in the first place.\\n\\nThat Iran strategy was never endorsed by the president, said a U.S. official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive policy details.\\n\\nWhile Trump shares his advisers' combative views on Iran, he has focused mainly on the 2015 nuclear deal, which he pulled out of earlier this year. Pompeo and Bolton, meanwhile, have taken a broader view and advocated new actions to rein in Iran's support for proxy groups.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLate last year, some of the president's hawkish advisers drafted a memo committing the United States to a longer-term presence in Syria that included goals of an enduring defeat of the Islamic State, a political transition and the expulsion of Iran, officials said. The president has not signed the memo, which was presented to him weeks ago.\\n\\nIn fact, Trump had warned his aides for months that he wanted out of Syria in short order. But Bolton and Pompeo, apparently believing like other officials across the government that the president had softened that demand, continued to relay bold plans for the country ahead of the surprise withdrawal announcement.\\n\\nDefeating ISIS, which was once our primary focus, continues to be a top priority, but it will now be joined by two other mutually reinforcing objectives, Pompeo said in October. These include a peaceful and political resolution to the Syrian conflict and the removal of all Iranian and Iranian-backed forces from Syria.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn Thursday, Pompeo acknowledged that American forces were leaving but insisted that the United States would continue its mission of countering the Islamic State and Iran. The counter-Iran campaign continues, Pompeo told news outlet Newsmax. We'll do all of those things. . . . We will simply do it at a time when the American forces have departed Syria.\\n\\nRobert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, said a well-functioning National Security Council would typically straighten out the dissonance between the president's wishes and those of the Pentagon and State Department. In this case, Bolton continued to push forward despite the conflicting views.\\n\\nBolton got way out ahead of the policy, and it's his job to understand what the president wants, said Ford, now a fellow at the Middle East Institute. When the president is nervous or cautious about something, it's the NSC's job to relay that back to State and the Pentagon, and warn them not to go too far. Apparently they didn't get the message.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBolton, Trump's third national security adviser, has advanced steps in keeping with the two men's shared hostility to multilateral institutions like the United Nations, but his expansive view on the use of U.S. military power has appeared to conflict with the president's instincts.\\n\\nA White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the United States would use a range of tools of national power, including sanctions and diplomatic pressure, to continue pressing Tehran to pull its forces out of Syria.\\n\\nIran knows the U.S. stands ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interests, the official said.\\n\\nBolton's Iran plan never really took effect at the Pentagon, where officials were not officially tasked with any new mission in addition to the operation against the Islamic State. Military officials likewise viewed Iran's expansion into Syria as problematic, but they were skeptical about the lack of a clear legal justification that would be required for offensive military action against Iranian-backed forces.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMilitary officials remain focused on executing an orderly withdrawal of forces from a constellation of small facilities across Syria. While Trump had previously said troops would come home within 30 days, officials said they expect the drawdown to occur within four months, giving the military time to break down its positions and remove sensitive equipment that might have to be destroyed in a more hurried withdrawal.\\n\\nAlthough Trump has declared victory against the Islamic State, airstrikes continue against militant forces in eastern Syria, where several hundred extremists were killed in the final weeks of December alone, according to the Pentagon.\\n\\nWe are continuing the fight against ISIS with our partners in Syria, a defense official said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut officials noted that preparing for a departure will become the troops' top priority, meaning they will be able to provide less support to the SDF even as it continues to battle the Islamic State.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOfficials at the Pentagon and State Department are also intensely skeptical that Turkey will deliver on what the White House has said is a promise to hunt down what remains of the Islamic State. Doing so would require moving Turkish military forces into areas now dominated by the Kurdish SDF, its sworn enemy.\\n\\nThe SDF, meanwhile, might seek to forge an alliance with the Syrian government, potentially strengthening Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. departure could also undermine the long-standing goal of forcing a political transition in Syria — let alone seeking to extinguish the Islamic State and reining in Iran at the same time."}
{"original": "It turned out that Pelosi (D-Calif.) was calling to ask Williams to second her nomination for speaker when the Democratic caucus met to choose its leaders.\\n\\nI had the privilege of speaking before the entire House Democratic caucus to second the nomination of Speaker Pelosi and give brief remarks on why I was supporting her, Williams said of the November meeting.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt was another high point for Williams, who, along with other Georgia Democrats, is enjoying the spotlight after delivering big in the state in the November election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWilliams, 42, was sworn in Sunday to the seat that had been held for 33 years by Rep. John Lewis (D), the civil rights icon who died of pancreatic cancer last year at age 80. Lewis was a political role model and personal friend to Williams, whose husband was an aide to the congressman.\\n\\nShe also is chair of the Georgia Democratic Party, which secured the state's 16 electoral votes for Joe Biden in the presidential election. And Tuesday, she will be leading the charge to win two Senate runoff elections that will determine which party controls the upper chamber.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSo, no, I feel zero pressure, she joked during an interview.\\n\\nWilliams's political ascension coincided with the comeback of Georgia's Democratic Party, which she joined when she moved to Atlanta after graduating from Talladega College in Alabama.\\n\\nIn 2019, Williams became the first Black woman to chair the state party, after working to help Stacey Abrams in her gubernatorial bid. Though Abrams lost, the close margin was a sign that Georgia was on the verge of turning blue after nearly 30 years of Republican dominance in statewide elections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSnaring a Democratic victory in the November general election, and forcing Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler into runoffs, was the culmination of more than a decade of aggressively registering and engaging Black voters, the party's largest and most loyal base of support. Turnout, particularly among Black, Latino, Asian American and young voters, will be key to the hopes of Democrats Jon Ossoff, a documentary filmmaker, and Raphael Warnock, senior pastor of Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, on Tuesday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWilliams is spending Election Day in Washington, where Congress will certify Biden's electoral college win Wednesday. But she said Tuesday that she is confident in the power of Georgia voters.\\n\\nIn November, we turned Georgia blue not because we got lucky, but because of decades of organizing and fighting to make sure every Georgia voter's voice is heard, she said. [T]hose same voters who demanded change in November are going to send Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock to the United States Senate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the outset of the runoff campaigns, political prognosticators noted that Democrats historically have not fared well in such races in Georgia. In a Senate runoff in 2008, for example, the Democratic candidate lost by 15 percentage points after a steep drop-off among Black voters who had turned out in large numbers during the general election to support Barack Obama's bid to become the first Black president. John McCain, the Arizona senator and Republican presidential nominee, won Georgia that year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGeorgia has changed tremendously since 2008, Williams said. In 2008 Georgia would have never had a Black woman chair of the Democratic Party. But here I sit. 2020 is just so very different.\\n\\nDuBose Porter, a former state lawmaker and party chairman, said he handed the party over to Williams, who was his vice chair, confident that she would take it to a new level.\\n\\nNikema has come up through the Young Democrats, she's helped rebuild the party, he said. It's time for young voices and young faces to take the lead, and there's none better than Nikema.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWilliams was born in Columbus, Ga., and raised just across the state line in Smiths Station, Ala., where she grew up on her grandparents' farm.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen people think about towns with one traffic light, well, we didn't even have that, Williams said. We had one flashing caution light in front of the high school, not even a real traffic light. The home that I grew up in had no indoor plumbing and no running water.\\n\\nWilliams said her upbringing has informed her work to improve the lives of women, people of color and low-income families. A few years after moving to Atlanta in the early 2000s, she went to work for Planned Parenthood, where she spent a dozen years and was vice president for public policy in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, before leaving in 2017 after winning a special election for the state Senate.\\n\\nFor the past two years, Williams has juggled multiple jobs: state senator representing Atlanta, deputy director of civic engagement for the National Domestic Workers Alliance and mother to Carter, her 5-year-old son. In March, she tested positive for the coronavirus and was sick for three weeks, although she did not have to be hospitalized.\\n\\nFor the domestic workers alliance, Williams developed a program that focused on identifying and engaging low-frequency women-of-color voters.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAi-jen Poo, the group's co-founder and executive director, said Williams pushed back against skeptics who said focusing on those voters would be too much work for too little return.\\n\\nNikema said, 'We know they can be reached,'  Poo said. And we would knock on these doors, and people would be so grateful to hear from us and say that nobody ever comes around here.\\n\\nThe alliance adopted the program across Georgia in 2018 and expanded it nationwide for the 2020 election.

It helped her decisively win the Democratic primary and come within 1.4 percentage points of becoming the nation's first Black female governor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWilliams was among many Black female political activists who worked tirelessly for Abrams's election, so much so that when her toddler son saw campaign yard signs he would exclaim Stacey!

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had gained 1.5 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq had bounced 2.1 percent. The Shanghai Composite index, which shed 8 percent Monday in its first day of trading since the Lunar New Year, rebounded and closed with a 1.3 percent gain after the People's Bank of China injected liquidity to support the market for the second day in a row. China-exposed companies whose stocks took a beating last week saw their shares rise, with Apple climbing 3.3 percent, Delta Air Lines up 3 percent and American Airlines up 5 percent.\\n\\nOil prices, which sank to a one-year low beneath $50 a barrel on Monday, were mixed Tuesday. Brent crude closed at $53.87 and West Texas Intermediate closed at $49.46. The virus has all but halted travel in China, the world's leading oil consumer, and prompted air carriers and tourism companies to announce widespread cancellations. Gold, a safe-haven for investors in turbulent times, was down 1.6 percent.\\n\\nStrong fourth-quarter earnings from giants such as Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Coca-Cola have also sparked positive sentiment in recent days. But Google parent Alphabet saw its shares plummet after the company reported income and revenue misses thanks to weak performance in its advertising business. Ford reported it lost $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and shares plunged in after-hours trading.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite the turnaround, storm clouds lie ahead. Experts have been using the 2003 SARS outbreak to gauge the potential fallout from the coronavirus on global growth, and a 2004 study from the Brookings Institution, Korea University and the Australian National University estimated that the outbreak delivered a $40 billion hit to the global economy; that would amount to about $56 billion today, adjusting for inflation. But the stakes are far higher now, as China is now one of the world's most vital economic engines: Its gross domestic product is roughly $13 trillion, compared with $1.6 trillion during the SARS outbreak. Even if the virus is contained quickly, economists are predicting China's growth rate will fall to between 3 and 4 percent this quarter.\\n\\nWhile I fully acknowledge the strong earnings and data from the United States, indeed pre Wuhan crisis, I fully expected the U.S. to continue to outperform the rest of the developed world, Jeffrey Halley, an analyst with OANDA, wrote in commentary Tuesday. Those earnings and data points though are backwards facing, and the potential impact of the Wuhan virus is nowhere near yet being able to be fully quantified in its implications for global growth.\\n\\nAt a Bipartisan Policy Center event Tuesday, former Federal Reserve chair Janet L. Yellen said that though past epidemics such as SARS delivered a short-term economic blow that then faded, it is unclear whether that will be the case with the coronavirus.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nChina is such a significant piece of the global economy that it's bound to have spillover effects, she said.\\n\\nThe outbreak comes at a pivotal moment, when the global economy was expected to rebound thanks to the trade truce between the United States and China. The outbreak has forced Starbucks to close half its stores in China, while McDonald's, KFC, Ikea and Apple have also announced closures.

{"original": "Transporting more than 100 pianos across town last spring, from Battlefield Shopping Center to Market Street in downtown Leesburg, was no easy task. In fact, Robert Purdon, general manager of the Piano Company, described the move as a logistical nightmare.\\n\\nBut after 16 years at the store's previous site, Purdon is happy with the shift to the current location, near the Loudoun County Government Center.\\n\\nIt was like coming home, Purdon said. Everything fits so perfectly with what we do. If we set out with a builder to structure a building to fit our needs perfectly, it couldn't be much more perfect than this.\\n\\nThe Piano Company's showroom in Leesburg houses instruments ranging from affordable uprights to grands costing tens of thousands of dollars. (Jim Barnes for The Washington Post)\\n\\nMost of the Piano Company's customers are local families, Purdon said. However, the store's selection of instruments also attracts a clientele that includes concert pianists, music professors, Hollywood actors, and Washington Redskins players and coaches, he said.\\n\\nThe store mostly sells high-end acoustic pianos, new and used, ranging in size from grands and baby grands to smaller uprights, consoles and spinets. It also carries some electronic pianos and hybrid instruments that blend acoustic elements with digital technology.\\n\\nHybrids are getting a lot of attention, he said. That may be where the industry is going.\\n\\nAlthough Purdon is partial to acoustic pianos, he acknowledged that the quality of electronic pianos is continually improving, making them an attractive option for individuals, churches or schools with limited budgets.\\n\\nWe're realists, he said.\\n\\nPrices range from about $1,000 for some electronic pianos on up, with no limit to the up, Purdon said.\\n\\nThe Piano Company's salespeople do not work on commission, he said, because he thinks there is a conflict of interest when salespeople — whose job is to provide expert advice to their customers — benefit more from selling certain makes or models.\\n\\nInstead, the business is structured like CarMax, he said. The sales prices of the pianos are clearly labeled, and it is the store's policy not to negotiate the cost.\\n\\nPurdon, 73, can speak with expertise about why one piano might be worth $10,000 while another is worth several times more. During a tour of the showroom, he gestured to instruments made by Steinway, Kawai and lesser-known companies such as Bohemia and Steingraeber, describing each.\\n\\nThe Piano Company's showroom displays what Purdon says are two of the finest pianos in the world — the Italian Fazioli, which he compared to a Ferrari, and the Japanese Shigeru Kawai, the top of the line for the Kawai brand. What sets them apart are craftsmanship and attention to detail, he said.\\n\\nThe three most important components of a piano are its wood, strings and hammers, he said. The finest piano manufacturers give great care to each detail and spend hundreds of hours hand-crafting each instrument.\\n\\nThere are less than 200 man-hours in an American Steinway, Purdon said, contrasting that with the upward of 750 artist-level hours that go into making a Shigeru Kawai, or the more than a thousand for a Fazioli.\\n\\nWhen you put a thousand man-hours into an instrument, you can get it to be pretty good, he said.\\n\\nThe store's centerpiece is a 10-foot, two-inch concert grand made by Fazioli that Purdon calls the Hope Diamond of pianos. Valued at a quarter of a million dollars, the piano is privately owned and not for sale. However, the owner allows it to be displayed at the store, and it is occasionally transported for concerts at the Kennedy Center or White House.\\n\\nPurdon carefully removed a cloth cover protecting the piano and lifted the lid, revealing the autographs of some of the artists who had played it in concert: Quincy Jones, Herbie Hancock, Randy Weston and others.\\n\\nAlthough the Piano Company attracts its share of music professionals and celebrities, Purdon said many of his customers are parents who learned to play piano as children and now want to pass that discipline on to their children.\\n\\nWhat we do is all about families, he said. It's strengthening from within, and I think that music can do this. It creates some wonderful memories, especially around holiday time."}
{"original": "AD\\n\\nPresident Trump wants to push this limited exception beyond what critics say the law allows. His appointees want his plans ensconced before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration this month. Despite Trump's lies about winning in November, administration officials know they have no time to tarry.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Trump administration is almost certainly pushing to finalize regulations prior to Biden taking office, said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign.\\n\\nThe converging church-state debates involve separate, yet connected issues with overlapping arguments that span the government. They are definitely related in the sense it's part of the administration's effort to expand religious exemptions and to license discrimination based on religion, said Lindsey Kaley, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Center for Liberty.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne set of proposed regulations takes effect on the eve of Inauguration Day and covers a broad swath of faith-based social service programs in nine agencies — the Departments of Education, Homeland Security, Agriculture, Justice, Labor, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and the Agency for International Development.\\n\\nPresident Trump has maintained his evangelical support even while making strange comments about church, prayer and the Bible over the years. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe new rule, drafted jointly by the agencies in response to a May 2018 Trump executive order, reflects Trump's commitment to protect the religious freedom and conscience rights of all Americans, including those who receive support from federal programs to do their good work, said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. The rule clarifies that faith-based organizations do not lose their legal protections and rights because they participate in federal programs and activities.\\n\\nThe executive branch wants faith-based and community organizations, to the fullest opportunity permitted by law, to compete on a level playing field for grants, contracts, programs, and other Federal funding opportunities, Trump wrote in the executive order.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRobert C. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), chairman of the House Education Committee, opposes the rule. It would undermine the rights of beneficiaries, employees and students in federally funded programs, he said in a statement, and underscores this Administration's fundamental misunderstanding of religious liberty as envisioned by our founders.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSeparately, a rule affecting federal contractors and subcontractors is designed to ensure the government respects religious employers' free exercise rights, protects workers from prohibited discrimination, and defends the values of a pluralistic society, says the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.\\n\\nThe protect-and-defend parts of this mission statement could be turned upside down, opponents argue, while the rule gives too much deference to religious employers' prejudices. The rule is scheduled to take effect Friday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is particularly troubling that the proposed rule seeks to so broadly expand the religious exemption that it would allow companies claiming sincerely held religious beliefs to discriminate against Catholics, Jews or, for example, LGBTQ individuals, pregnant and unmarried women, interracial married couples, divorced men and women, and other workers who do not conform to their employers' beliefs, Scott wrote to Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia last month. For the first time ever, for-profit companies, not just religious nonprofit organizations, would be allowed to use taxpayer dollars to discriminate on the basis of religion or religious beliefs in federal contracts.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlso, a proposed update to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) compliance manual says the new language provides guidance to employers on how to balance the needs of individuals in a diverse religious climate.\\n\\nBut organizations from American Atheists to the Union for Reform Judaism, from the NAACP to the Women's Law Project, are urging the EEOC to withdraw the proposed guidance because, among a long list of objections, it takes an expansive, unsupported view of the range of entities that qualify as 'religious organizations.' \\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn their Dec. 17 letter to the EEOC, the 44 groups told the commission it should abandon its Proposed Updated Compliance Manual on Religious Discrimination because it would be especially detrimental to the employment rights of women, people of color, LGBTQ persons and others, including nonbelievers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHouse and Senate Democrats accused the EEOC of a rushed and limited process to clear the update because time for public comment and consideration by the presidentially appointed commissioners was restricted. The EEOC said the 30-day comment period is in its regulations, but a spokesperson would not comment on the substance of a matter under deliberation.\\n\\nTrump's 2018 executive order established a White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative and directed agencies to designate a liaison for related programs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, the directive added, provide such information, support, and assistance to the Initiative as it may request to develop public policy proposals.\\n\\nBut how much government support and assistance to religious organizations is permitted in a nation guided by the separation of church and state?\\n\\nNot as much, perhaps, as Trump wants."}
{"original": "The author as a child, with watermelon. (Family Photo)\\n\\nMultiplatform editor\\n\\nWhen I was about 8 years old, I was at a family picnic, running around in my Toughskins — husky fit — and a T-shirt that defied tucking, when I overheard a great aunt tell my mom that when I hit my teens, I would shoot up like a beanpole.\\n\\nShe was wrong. So wrong.\\n\\nTo say that I've struggled with my weight all my life is a blatant misuse of the term struggle. I've rarely cared much; I've mostly accepted it as part of who I am and learned to live with it. But early in 2016, something changed. I wasn't feeling great. I knew my weight was up, but I hadn't checked in a while. Mostly because I didn't want to know. And I was staring down the barrel of my 50th birthday.\\n\\nI decided I needed to do something. But it would be complicated. I write about food as part of my profession. I have friends and colleagues who are food journalists and others who are chefs. Working and playing with them means that eating new and interesting things is more than just sport; it's my job.\\n\\nAnd I love my job.\\n\\nThis isn't a story that has a tidy ending about how I figured out just the right balance to achieve fitness and happiness and assure my ultimate immortality. It's a story about a roller-coaster ride with big drops, ominous ascents, curves taken hard and developments that I never saw coming.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe author, testing a recipe. (Jennifer Chase/For the Washington Post)\\n\\nThe thing about being way overweight is — and I'm speaking for myself because I know this isn't going to be popular — it makes losing weight pretty easy, especially at first. I've done it before. When I've decided I needed to, I've been able to drop 20 or 30 pounds without trying too hard. A couple of times, I've lost around 100 pounds. That took a lot of work, but there was a sense of accomplishment, and I felt and looked better.\\n\\nThe problem is that keeping the weight off is even more work than taking it off. I can stay focused long enough to lose it, only to learn that reprieve isn't part of the reward.\\n\\nWhen I decided to get on the scale in April 2016, I suspected what it would say, and I was correct: I had exceeded the capacity of the scale. (That's happened to me before, and at least once I decided a reasonable solution was to buy a scale with a higher limit.)\\n\\nWhen I went to a gym that had a bigger scale, I was up roughly 50 pounds from about four years earlier.\\n\\nIt was disappointing. Not surprising, but disappointing. Still, by that point, I had already established a plan.\\n\\nFor exercise, I would walk. I was already a slave to my step tracker. I had a daily goal of 10,000 steps — about five miles — so I decided I wanted to end the year with at least 3.66 million steps: my daily goal times 366. (It was a leap year!) Because it was late April and I hadn't been strict, I would have to average more than 10,000 the rest of the way. That made it a challenge.\\n\\nNow I needed a food plan.\\n\\nA doctor once told me he had a simple rule for weight loss: If it tastes good, spit it out.\\n\\nI never went back to that doctor.\\n\\nMaybe he said it to sound funny, but it made me angry. Food is a pleasure and an adventure. I love the sense of discovery that comes with new flavor combinations. I love the social aspect. And while I understand what people mean when they say they eat their feelings, I cook to express my feelings. If I cook for you, it's probably because I care about you. It's literally my language, and I have no interest in learning a new one.\\n\\nI remembered a friend once had some success with a diet in which he didn't let himself eat after 8 p.m. That time didn't work for my lifestyle, so I modified it: Whenever I ate for the last time in the evening, I wouldn't eat again for 12 hours. (I later learned that a version of this was an actual plan called the Buddha's Diet, but at the time I just thought I was a genius.)\\n\\nIt worked almost immediately. Soon I had lost enough to register on my home scale again, and I was losing one or two pounds a week. And it wasn't hard to figure out why. I felt compelled to start the 12-hour timer as early as possible, because the earlier I was done eating one day, the earlier I could have breakfast the next. This created two consequences that worked in my favor. First, I stopped snacking at night. No mindless chips in front of the television, no half a pint of ice cream. Second, to keep my mind off the snacks I wasn't eating, I walked.\\n\\nFor the most part, I ate what I wanted, just less of it. And I was spending a lot of time writing, which left me little time to cook. Dinner was often a simple salad at the keyboard. If I couldn't be bothered to assemble vegetables, I had a bowl of cereal. I pretty much cut pasta and rice — the building blocks of my preferred diet — out of the picture. That hurt. I do love my carbohydrates.\\n\\n[Carbs and me: We're inseparable]\\n\\nBut I felt better. Soon, my clothes started hanging off me to the point that I had to replace them. The first person to say anything to me about it was the clerk at my butcher shop.\\n\\nYou're in here all the time, right? You're looking good, she said. You losing weight?\\n\\nI was down almost 60 pounds at that point. And just before Christmas, I passed 3.66 million steps.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe author celebrating a childhood birthday. (Family Photo)\\n\\nSince I hit my step goal in 2016, I decided to aim for 4 million in 2017, which meant roughly an extra 1,000 steps a day. No big deal.\\n\\nA bigger deal was that my responsibility for the cookbook I was working on shifted. We were mostly done writing, and I needed to test recipes. That meant a lot of cooking. And more food — delicious, delicious food — around the house.\\n\\nIt also meant I was eating later. I work on books in addition to my editing job at the paper, so I wouldn't start cooking until 7 p.m. and often finished after 10. That became dinnertime. I put my 12-hour rule on hiatus, convinced that this was short-term and that I'd be fine in a month or two.\\n\\nThe problem is, good habits die easily. Once the testing was done, I didn't fall back into those fasts. I hadn't gained any weight, but I hadn't lost any. I gave myself a break.\\n\\nThen I got another gig.\\n\\nI needed to test 60 desserts for an Italian cookbook in less than 30 days. It was fantastic. There were tortas. There were crostatas. There were gelati and sorbetti. There were cookies. Oh, there were so, so many cookies.\\n\\nMy policy was to taste everything as soon as possible — part of the job — and find someone else to eat what was left. I took cakes to the office. I sent budini to my wife's office. I heard a friend didn't have time to cook for a potluck, so I made her a plate of assorted treats. If friends had a get-together, I brought a dessert. Or three. The guards at my building came to expect me to show up at midnight with something sweet for them. Anyone I knew with a birthday got a box of cookies in the mail.\\n\\nI was nervous and increased my weigh-ins from once a week to three or four times. I was creeping up, but not fast. At the end of the month, I was up six pounds, and I considered that a victory, under the circumstances.\\n\\nAfter finishing that job, I didn't get on the scale for about a week, just to give myself a bit of a mental vacation. When I weighed in after that, I was up another six pounds.\\n\\nAll of a sudden it was October, I was up 12 pounds, and I wasn't happy about it — except when I was eating a big bowl of pasta.\\n\\nI didn't gain any more the rest of the year, though, and I did hit my goal of 4 million steps. (Admittedly, it was more than a little annoying that I gained weight while increasing my walking.) The cookbook work I had done over the year was undeniably a factor in derailing my weight loss.\\n\\nWas it worth it?\\n\\nI don't have to be happy about the side effect, but I can still say that I think so. I did work I'm proud of.\\n\\nI've never been thin, and I'm never going to be. As it stands now, I would like to drop 60 pounds. Or so. I have more projects on the radar, but I know losing weight doesn't have to be complicated. Eat thoughtfully, avoid eating mindlessly, get the cookies out of the house as soon as possible — and take a break once in a while and walk.\\n\\nThat was my recipe for success before, so I go into 2018 with a sense of optimism.\\n\\nAgain."}
{"original": "Manchin has sided with Trump on tough votes before, such as the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. But voting to acquit the president would be an even more politically charged decision, one that could help him maintain his reputation as a moderate back home but would probably make him a pariah within his own party.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOver three days, the House impeachment managers laid out opening arguments in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nHe struck a conciliatory note toward the president Saturday, becoming the only Democrat to publicly praise Trump's defense team even as he called for more witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\\n\\nI thought they did a good job in presenting the defense for the president, he said. The most important thing I took away from today was, they made very clear that there's not one witness that we've heard from . . . that had direct contact with the president. That reaffirms why I have said we should have witnesses.\\n\\nManchin, 72, isn't the only moderate Democrat who White House aides said they believe could vote to acquit the president. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Doug Jones (Ala.) are also considered possibilities because they represent states Trump won in 2016.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSpeaking in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va., on April 5, 2018, President Trump claimed Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) votes against everything Trump supports. (The Washington Post)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut Manchin is the only one they consider able to be swayed not only by politics back home but also by his relationship with the president, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss issues involving the impeachment trial.\\n\\nTrump has interacted with Manchin — a brawny, backslapping former governor — more than any Democrat in the Senate. Manchin has come over for movie screenings, including Darkest Hour, the 2017 historical drama about Winston Churchill, and the president has given him tours of the family residence and his private study.\\n\\nI'm not going to have the kind of relationship with him that Democrats have, Manchin said in an interview last month.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA White House official noted that Trump has done several favors for Manchin — including giving two basketball players, Jerry West and Bob Cousy, the Medal of Freedom — at the senator's urging.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump agreed to take pictures with Manchin that were used in the senator's 2018 campaign, and the president has called him out of the blue just to talk politics while repeatedly asking him to become a Republican. People close to the president said he has more affection for Manchin than any other Senate Democrat, and that he understands the transactional nature of the relationship.\\n\\nTrump recently made a show of his support for a bill he signed into law last year that was championed by Manchin concerning pension and health-care benefits for coal miners.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe will get this done for our great Miners! Trump wrote on Jan. 10 in a quote-tweet of Manchin's month-old tweet promoting the deal over the legislation.\\n\\nTrump has not directly lobbied Manchin on impeachment since the trial started, counting on their past relationship and political pressure back home to weigh on the West Virginian. But people close to the senator and the president said they believe Trump may reach out before the trial is done.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe last time the two spoke was in December, when Trump signed the provisions for coal miners into law as part of a bigger legislative package. But Manchin met at the White House this month ahead of the Senate trial with senior aides, including legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, who is taking a central role in the impeachment fight. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSenate Democrats are warily eyeing Manchin, nervous about how he will vote. A senior Democratic aide said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) was pleased that Manchin has pushed for new documents from the administration and for witnesses to appear before the Senate, even in local media, but they have received no assurances on how he will vote.\\n\\nEvery member is making up their own mind, Schumer said in a statement to The Washington Post. They know how I feel.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nManchin has also been critical of how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) handled the run-up to the trial, but he has declined to criticize the president, saying he wants to weight the evidence against him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nManchin said that if the facts are totally indisputable, he would vote to convict. I'm taking this extremely seriously.\\n\\nPeople who have spoken with the senator said he believes the president behaved improperly but has not decided whether it is an impeachable offense — and is concerned about what precedent it might set to remove Trump from office.\\n\\nHe is also aware of how the issue is playing back home, even if he does not plan to run for reelection in 2024.\\n\\nA recent poll commissioned by Club for Growth, a conservative group, shows 69 percent of 500 West Virginia voters surveyed oppose impeaching the president. That is consistent with other public polling in the state, where Trump won by 42 percent over Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe voters are signaling to Joe, 'We like you, but we don't want you go to against our guy,'  said David McIntosh, the leader of Club for Growth. In West Virginia, they have a deep loyalty to Manchin, but a lot of those same voters are really strong Trump supporters.\\n\\nIn several ways, Manchin is distinct. He was reelected in 2018 after Trump went into his state several times, telling West Virginians that their senator was consistently voting against the president's agenda. An array of presidential surrogates also visited the state to campaign for Patrick Morrissey, Manchin's opponent.\\n\\nHe voted against everything, Trump said at a West Virginia rally in 2018. Donald Trump Jr. called Manchin Schumer's little pet in one of his visits to the state. But Manchin won despite the president's popularity in the state.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen the two men had lunch just after the 2018 midterm election at the White House, Trump turned to Ivanka Trump and Vice President Pence, smiled and said: I told you we couldn't beat him.\\n\\nWell, hell, it wasn't for a lack of trying, Manchin said he responded, mentioning that Trump visited West Virginia multiple times.\\n\\nThe president then laughed and said, Oh, Joe, you know I like you, according to Manchin. The senator said he shrugged it off and they had lunch for almost two hours.\\n\\nWe understand what game we're in, he said. It's a tough business.\\n\\nManchin has voted with the president more than 53 percent of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight — more than any other current Democratic senator.\\n\\nStill, he said he has been repeatedly disappointed with Trump on policy issues. He said he wanted the president to pass a different tax bill, one that didn't provide as big a tax break to corporations. On gun violence, he said he had several substantive conversations with the president, where Trump seemed like he was willing to pass some restrictions on firearms and buck the powerful National Rifle Association, but ultimately did not.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEvery time I have spoken to him, his instincts have always been very moderate, very common sense, Manchin said. By the time the last person comes in and hits him with this and that and the polls, we lose him. I think if the political pundits didn't get in his face all the time and make him think he's going to lose this election if you lose one of your followers, we could get something done. He has a hardcore political staff. They say, 'It's all about the base. You might lose one voter.' And then he backs down.\\n\\nManchin said he repeatedly told the president that his base is largely unshakable. Trust me, Mr. President, I tried to shake your base and I couldn't do it, he said he told Trump.\\n\\nThe senator has had less positive interactions with some of the president's staff, including senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and Mike Williams, a top aide to Mulvaney.\\n\\nI don't see anything good there, he said of Miller and Mulvaney.\\n\\nManchin said Trump would be better off if he took on issues such as lowering prescription drug prices and pushing a bipartisan infrastructure package and said he wanted to work with the president.\\n\\nWe have a good relationship because we connect, he said."}

The attorney general said prosecutors should use their own discretion, taking into consideration the department's limited re­sources, the seriousness of the crime and the deterrent effect that they could impose.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOver the past two decades, public opinion has swung dramatically toward decriminalizing pot. A survey conducted in October by the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of U.S. adults support marijuana legalization, which is nearly double the percentage favoring it in 2000. Among Republicans overall, 43 percent were in favor — although that number reached 62 percent among GOP-leaning voters younger than 40.\\n\\nCannabis is a totally different political issue now than it was 50 years ago, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a leading advocate for allowing states to decide the question for themselves. Politically, none of the old analysis is holding true.\\n\\nAmong Republicans, the topic is a particularly treacherous one, because it pulls at the seams of the party's coalition — pitting social conservatives against those who stand most strongly for states' rights, libertarians and fiscal hawks who see the burgeoning marijuana industry as a major source of tax revenue.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe attorney general is going to find out pretty quickly he's in a distinct minority, not only among the American public, but in the United States Congress, said John Hudak, deputy director of the Brookings Institution's Center for Effective Public Management and author of the 2016 book Marijuana: A Short History.\\n\\nThis is one more headache, Hudak said, and one more issue that they do not want to be on the defensive about with the voters.\\n\\nMany of the places where marijuana legalization is most popular — in California, for instance, where it has just taken effect — are also areas where Republicans are struggling the hardest to hold onto House seats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome insist that GOP candidates will not suffer from the new policy if they make clear that they disagree.\\n\\nRepublican candidates for Congress will answer that question based on what fits their district or state, said Ralph Reed, head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, an evangelical political group that has campaigned against legalization.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWill it really hurt us among young voters? It could, Reed acknowledged, but he added: You cannot ignore a federal law on the books. It breeds cynicism. It undermines respect. It undermines confidence in government itself.\\n\\nHow important marijuana becomes as a topic of campaign debate is likely to hinge on how Sessions's directive, issued last week, is implemented by U.S. attorneys across the country, many of whom are serving on an interim basis until permanent appointments can be made and confirmed by the Senate.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe now have, in what I believe is a states' rights area, 93 unelected federal officials determining state decisions, Gardner said.\\n\\nEarly indications are that they could head in significantly different directions, reflecting different priorities.\\n\\nIn Colorado, where recreational marijuana use is legal, interim U.S. attorney Bob Troyer said he will continue to put his focus only on identifying and prosecuting those who create the greatest safety threats to our communities around the state.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut in Massachusetts, where recreational sales are to begin this year under a ballot initiative passed in 2016, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling indicated that no pot sellers should consider themselves safe: Deciding, in advance, to immunize a certain category of actors from federal prosecution would be to effectively amend the laws Congress has already passed, and that I will not do.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOregon has long had a tolerant attitude toward marijuana. It decriminalized possession of less than 1 ounce in 1973. And the newly legalized recreational pot industry brought in $85 million in tax revenue last year, said state Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum.\\n\\nWe have a growing, robust industry. You can't put that genie back in the bottle, Rosenblum said. We're not freaking out. One of the keys is a good relationship with your U.S. attorney.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Oregon's case, the acting U.S. attorney, Billy J. Williams — who is awaiting Senate confirmation to remain in that post — has indicated he will continue to pursue shared public safety objectives, with an emphasis on stemming the overproduction of marijuana and the diversion of marijuana out of state, dismantling criminal organizations and thwarting violent crime in our communities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump sent mixed signals on the issue.\\n\\nHe told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that recreational marijuana is causing a lot of problems out there. But as he was campaigning in Colorado, a state where recreational marijuana is legal, Trump said in an interview with Denver's KUSA: I think it's up to the states, yeah. I'm a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut after Sessions announced the new policy, the White House declared that Trump was completely in agreement.\\n\\nThe President believes in enforcing federal law, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. That would be his top priority. That is regardless of what the topic is, whether it's marijuana, or whether it's immigration, the president strongly believes we should enforce federal law."}
{"original": "They are unnecessary, unjustified, unmoored from a cost-benefit assessment, and unlikely to advance the Commission's stated goal of enhancing consumer privacy, wrote the Internet & Television Association, known as NCTA.\\n\\nThe petition joins a bevy of others from groups representing telecom companies, wireless carriers, tech companies and advertisers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe rules, which passed by a 3-to-2 partisan vote favoring Democrats at the Federal Communications Commission in October, are meant to keep Internet providers such as Comcast, Verizon and others from abusing the behavioral data they collect on customers as they regularly use the Internet.\\n\\nInformation such as your Web browsing history, your geolocation logs and even the content of your emails offer service providers a rich source of potential advertising revenue. That data, along with your health and financial information, can also be sold to marketers and data brokers interested in building a profile of you as a consumer. The FCC's rules restricted Internet providers' ability to use and share this information, in what privacy advocates hailed as a historic victory.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut now the fate of those regulations lies in question as Republicans prepare to take control of the nation's top telecom watchdog. Consumer advocacy groups vowed Wednesday to oppose the cable industry's petition.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNothing in this election changed Americans' fundamental rights, or their need for privacy, said Matt Wood, policy director for Free Press, an advocacy organization. The election only gave more power to the party that would seemingly rather side with Comcast and other cable lobbyists than with their own constituents.\\n\\nOpponents of the rules point out that the FCC's regulation created an imbalance in the law: While Internet providers must (for now) obey the restrictions, nothing forces Web companies such as Google and Facebook to do the same. For the past three years, the FCC under Democratic leadership has repeatedly vowed not to regulate Web companies, giving rise to complaints by telecom and cable lobbyists that the FCC was biased in their favor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the same time, defenders of the FCC's privacy rules argue that Internet providers are uniquely positioned to see everything a customer does with his or her connection — unlike services such as Facebook, whose understanding of user behavior is generally limited to the boundaries of its own platform.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPolitically, the industry petition comes at a significant time. It was filed days after the departure of one Democratic commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel, and just weeks before the agency's most senior Democrat, Tom Wheeler, is due to step down. Both moves will leave the FCC with a two-Republican majority and a one-Democrat minority, allowing the GOP to begin repealing regulations almost as soon as President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into the Oval Office.\\n\\nRepublicans at the FCC were already anticipating the opportunity last month.\\n\\nWe need to fire up the weed whacker and remove those rules that are holding back investment, innovation and job creation, said Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai in a December speech to a conservative think tank."}
{"original": "Do you even need an unlimited plan?\\n\\nThis is the first question you'll want to answer before you grapple with the carriers' various offerings. Let's say you don't use your mobile data for very much beyond basic Web browsing and email. Or maybe the bulk of your smartphone usage happens while you're at home or at the office, where there's WiFi. Under those conditions, you might be better off signing up for a metered plan — that is, one with a monthly data cap.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese plans tend to be more affordable than the typical unlimited data plan, assuming you stay within your data limits. For example, the difference in price between a 2 GB plan on Verizon and an unlimited plan on the same network is about $45 a month for a single line.\\n\\nExceeding your monthly cap on a metered plan could result in additional fees or reduced browsing speeds. If you find yourself blowing past your limit on a regular basis, you might consider upgrading to a larger data bucket or to an unlimited plan.\\n\\nTo figure out how much data you use in a month, follow these steps if you're an Android user and these instructions if you're on iOS. Spend a few weeks analyzing your habits, and some useful trends should emerge.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnlimited plans benefit heavy data users\\n\\nIf you stream lots of music or video over 3G or 4G LTE, then you may want to consider an unlimited plan. But which service to choose? Here's our side-by-side comparison of all the major carriers' offerings. We'll highlight particular points of interest below, but consider this a starting point.\\n\\nAs you can see, while it may be tempting simply to choose the cheapest option, there are a ton of other factors that may shape your decision.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat's the catch?\\n\\nMany of these plans come with a trade-off of some kind or another, meaning that although they vastly expand the amount of data you're allowed to use compared with other plans, they're still not technically unlimited as their marketing may imply.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAT&T, for example, requires its unlimited data customers to subscribe to one of its television products, DirecTV or U-verse. It doesn't matter if you already have AT&T cellular service but not TV, or vice versa. You just need to end up with both phone and TV service at the end of the day to qualify for unlimited data. This might not make sense if you already get your TV service through a company such as Comcast or Verizon, but it could work for those households that don't already subscribe to TV. Note that DirecTV Now, AT&T's online streaming TV service, doesn't count toward this program. So if you have that and are simply hoping to tack on an unlimited wireless subscription, you're out of luck. (Update: AT&T has since revised its unlimited data plan, allowing you to purchase one without having to subscribe to one of AT&T's TV services.)\\n\\nIf you don't care about how good your video looks or how nice your streaming audio sounds, you might consider saving some money and opting for T-Mobile or Sprint. Both carriers tend to downgrade content quality to reduce the load on their networks; Sprint is particularly aggressive about it, limiting audio streams to a bitrate of 500 kbps, online games to 2 Mbps and video to 480p resolution. This means audio may sound less clear, video games may not perform as smoothly and video may not appear as sharp. There doesn't appear to be a way around Sprint's policy, but it also offers the cheapest unlimited plan of the bunch.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nT-Mobile's approach to content is a little more mixed. Customers of its unlimited plan, T-Mobile One, can choose whether to view online videos at reduced quality or at full HD resolution starting Feb. 17 for no extra charge (HD capabilities now cost an additional $15 per month per line).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/831239592820871169\\n\\nThis offers greater flexibility, but for those who constantly stream at full HD, there are other risks to consider. Use too much data (more than 28 GB in a month) and T-Mobile may decide to slow down your connection.\\n\\nT-Mobile isn't the only company that says it may throttle your consumption after a certain point. Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint all have policies designed to curb extremely heavy data usage above 20 GB a month. This may seem nonsensical for a plan that's billed as unlimited — and regulators have tended to agree — but until carriers change their ways, data hogs who hit their carriers' unlimited limits might consider moving some of their Internet usage to a residential broadband plan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCan I share my phone's connection to a PC?\\n\\nIf you need to do some work on your laptop but there's no WiFi, one option is to share your phone's data connection with your PC. If this is important to you, you may want to choose Verizon or T-Mobile because they offer a lot of tethering data. Verizon's unlimited plan supports up to 10 GB of hotspot usage per month right out of the box, while T-Mobile plans to make 10 GB of monthly hotspot data available to T-Mobile One customers beginning Friday.\\n\\nWhat do I get if I travel a lot?\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you frequently travel to Canada or Mexico, T-Mobile arguably offers the easiest solution in its unlimited plan. Data roaming is included for those countries, and you don't have to go out of your way to add on a roaming package. You use your data just like you would in the United States. T-Mobile was also the first to liberalize its broader international roaming policies, which remain pretty competitive.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhat if I have a grandfathered unlimited plan?\\n\\nIf you signed up for an older unlimited plan years ago before companies such as AT&T and Verizon stopped selling unlimited plans, should you switch? The answer depends on what you're paying and whether some of the restrictions mentioned above are dealbreakers for you.\\n\\nAs an example, suppose you're paying $90 a month for a single grandfathered unlimited plan on Verizon, as this person does. (Note: This is an actual Verizon bill provided by a customer to The Washington Post. The customer provided it on the condition of anonymity to protect their personal financial information.)\\n\\nIt costs $39.99 a month for the phone line, plus $49.99 for the unlimited data. Because you can't have the unlimited data without the voice service, we can treat the sum as the effective cost of the unlimited plan. This person receives a few discounts here and there that appear tailored to their particular situation, so let's simply use the $90 base figure and move on.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCompared with the price of one of the new Verizon unlimited plans, this legacy plan costs about $10 more per month, and it doesn't come with hotspot data or the roaming benefits of the new plans. So switching to the new unlimited plan might be a good deal. Because the customer used only about 7.9 GB of data in the last billing cycle, they could also save $20 a month by downgrading to Verizon's 8 GB plan. But that would mean flirting with overages if that usage started to grow substantially."}
{"original": "But the Taliban does not have full control over all areas outside government hands. Other factions, including breakaway Taliban groups and others claiming allegiance to the Islamic State, have footholds around the country and potentially could grow stronger without U.S.-led forces to keep them in check.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOther major challenges lie ahead: Afghanistan's deepening political crisis, a controversial prisoner swap and complex intra-Afghan talks that could drag on for months or longer.\\n\\nEven the relative calm in Afghanistan over the past week — a precondition for the peace deal signing — was thrown into question.\\n\\nThe spokesman for the Taliban's Qatar office, Suhail Shaheen, told The Washington Post that the Taliban hoped for a permanent solution to violence levels. But the pledge for a week-long period of reduced violence has ended, he said.\\n\\nU.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar inked the deal on an ornate desk in an opulent hall at a hotel in Doha, Qatar, on Saturday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attended the ceremony and witnessed the signing while seated across from the two men.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPompeo called the moment historic and said the Taliban needed to live up to commitments to break with al-Qaeda and reduce violence.\\n\\nThe deal signing came after a seven-day reduction in violence in which U.S., Afghan and Taliban forces pledged not to carry out offensive operations. The agreement does not specify whether that commitment would continue. Instead, it notes that a cease-fire would need to be agreed upon in intra-Afghan talks that are expected to start in 10 days.\\n\\nThe withdrawal will begin with a drawdown to 8,600 troops within 135 days, according to the document. During that time, U.S. allies and coalition members will also proportionally draw down their forces.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump called the deal a powerful path forward to end the war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home in a statement released Friday.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn Kabul, U.S. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said there is real hope for peace in Afghanistan, but he warned the Taliban to meet its obligations under the deal.\\n\\nThe United States will not hesitate to nullify the agreement, Esper said at a ceremony with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani that was held at the same time as the signing in Doha.\\n\\nStoltenberg called Saturday a victory for peace and noted increases in women's rights, life expectancy and respect for human rights.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe challenge now is to secure these gains, he said.\\n\\nGhani also pointed to advances made in Afghan society, including freedom of speech and the advancement of women's rights.\\n\\nToday can be the moment of overcoming the past, he said.\\n\\nBut criticism of the pact came from Trump's former White House team.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFormer national security adviser John Bolton said the deal brings an unacceptable risk to America's civilian population.\\n\\nLegitimizing Taliban sends the wrong signal to ISIS and al-Qaeda terrorists, and to America's enemies generally, Bolton wrote in a tweet.\\n\\nUnder the deal, the Afghan government must assemble a negotiating team that will work with the Taliban to agree on the makeup of the country's new government. The peace deal stipulates that those talks must begin by March 10.\\n\\nGhani faces the challenge of building an inclusive negotiating team to represent the Afghans who are not aligned with the Taliban. The announcement of disputed election results earlier this month has left the government in Kabul deeply divided and has the potential to undermine Ghani's mandate to form that team.\\n\\nAnother potential obstacle is a planned prisoner exchange. The text of the peace deal released by the State Department said the prisoner swap — the release of thousands of Taliban prisoners in Afghan custody for about 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces in Taliban captivity — must occur by March 10 when inter-Afghan talks are set to start.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe peace deal also stated that the United States will work to remove members of the Taliban from sanctions lists and seek economic cooperation and reconstruction with the new post settlement Afghan Islamic government.\\n\\nFollowing the signing ceremony in Doha, Shaheen, the Taliban spokesman, told The Post that the Taliban is committed to the deal, but that doesn't mean violence levels will remain low in Afghanistan.\\n\\nThat was for making the environment conducive to sign the deal, Shaheen said. The Taliban hopes to achieve a permanent solution to violence levels in Afghanistan, but right now [there is] no such understanding of a cease-fire or reduction in violence.\\n\\nShaheen also suggested there may be some gray area in the Taliban's commitment not to allow terrorist groups to use Afghan soil to plan and launch attacks against the United States and its allies.\\n\\nA peace deal with the Taliban has been a critical foreign policy goal for Trump, who campaigned on ending the war. But he has faced fierce criticism from the Afghan government as well as from fellow Republicans at home.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfghan officials have repeatedly criticized the United States for excluding them from talks with the Taliban. Any significant withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country is expected to place increased pressure on Afghan government forces, whose casualty rates continue to rise.\\n\\nOn Thursday, a group of Republican lawmakers released a letter warning that the Taliban has a history of extracting concessions in exchange for false assurances.\\n\\nA full-scale U.S. withdrawal would allow terrorist groups in Afghanistan to grow stronger and establish safe havens from which to plot attacks against us, the letter continued.\\n\\nTrump's Friday statement said ultimately it will be up to the people of Afghanistan to work out their future. We, therefore, urge the Afghan people to seize this opportunity for peace and a new future for their country.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nU.S. and Taliban negotiators were close to signing a peace deal in September, but the effort was scuttled by Trump after an attack by the Taliban killed a U.S. soldier.\\n\\nSince then, Khalilzad has sought confidence-building measures to bring both sides back to the table. In November, the Taliban released two Western hostages in exchange for the release of senior militants linked to the Taliban by the Afghan government. And over the last week, both sides reduced violence nationwide.\\n\\nIt is unclear if the reduction in violence will hold in the coming weeks as Afghan government officials and the Taliban begin talks. The Afghan government initially demanded a cease-fire before agreeing to talks with the Taliban.\\n\\nAs peace talks between the U.S. and the Taliban gained momentum last year, violence in Afghanistan intensified. The United Nations' annual report on civilian casualties released this month said 3,403 civilians were killed and 6,989 were injured in 2019.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan has documented more than 100,000 civilian casualties since the organization began its tally in 2009."}

{"original": "Wonder Woman 1984's critical reception has whipped from early praise to precipitous decline as fast as Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) can snap her lasso of truth. But while it's a pretty bad DC Comics movie — spoken as someone who, in general, really likes DC Comics movies — it is something rarer: a pretty solid Washington, D.C. movie. Given Hollywood's tendency to treat our nation's capital as geographically and culturally indistinct and weirdly underpopulated, it's nice to see WW84 break with that trend and show the world just how beautiful and eccentric the District and its residents can be.\\n\\nThe bad first: WW84 is scattershot and nonsensical, seemingly designed solely around a desire to get pilot Steve Trevor, who died in the first film, back for a second go-round, even if that means negating his heroic sacrifice.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo that end, writers Patty Jenkins (who also directed) and Geoff Johns introduce Maxwell Lord, who absorbs the power of a rock that grants wishes, but exacts a price — at least, sometimes. Where previous entries in the DC expanded universe pondered weightier ideas about what it would mean for mortal men to realize gods walk among them — and Wonder Woman, in turn, asked how gods would react to the realization that men have free will — this film's message is a more mundane You can't always get what you want or Be careful what you wish for.\\n\\nAll of this would be fine if the action sequences were any good; sadly, they are not. Perhaps it's just a function of watching this at home via HBO Max, as most people will, but everything on screen felt cheap and bland. There's nothing as exciting as the German assault on Wonder Woman's home island of Themyscira or her march through a World War I No Man's Land in the first film; everything is weightless and silly.\\n\\nStill, it's not all bad, and Wonder Woman 1984 is at its best when most rooted in its location. Unlike many Hollywood productions, the movie uses actual D.C. locations for both interior and exterior shots. Watching Wonder Woman stride through the iconic Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's entry and take a resurrected Steve on a tour of D.C.'s Metro system gave the picture a genuine Washington flair so often absent from movies like this. Big setpieces that take place on actual Washington streets in sight of the Capitol — and overhead during the city's annual fireworks extravaganza — as well as the use of more intimate locations such as the Watergate's apartment complexes, help make the movie's use of places such as the Reflecting Pool feel natural, rather than hastily added to remind audiences where they are.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis fealty to D.C. geography allows natives to give the occasional gaffe, like the suggestion of a Silver Line (or a Green Line!) in 1984, a pass. And it makes clear how obvious and often other productions try to get Toronto or some other bland locale to stand in for D.C.: WW84 joins Breach as one of the rare movies to get the geography — the look and the feel and the traffic — of D.C. just right, and as such, to present the city as a distinct place, rather than an unimportant one.\\n\\nMore than that, though, WW84 nails the mood of a certain sort of D.C. resident who believes that earning an internship in the White House would be enough to give a gangly young dork the gumption to ask a literal Amazon goddess out on a date.\\n\\nIndeed, in its treatment of folks around town — from the mousy-but-competent workers such as Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig) who get lost in the bureaucracy that employs them to the full-of-themselves donors and interns who operate the shadow economy that keeps D.C.'s institutions running — WW84 has a lot in common with Shattered Glass, Billy Ray's movie about the fabulist Stephen Glass, who almost took down the New Republic. That movie captured the sociology of D.C., with its weird mélange of poor pay, idealism and naked ambition in the service of jockeying for social position, in a way that few others have managed. Like that movie, WW84 shows how Washington's institutions and mores leave it at risk of being corrupted.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd while the film's sense of policy is rather iffy — Ronald Reagan, the architect of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, would have been unlikely to use Maxwell Lord's powers to wish for more nukes, as his fictional doppelgänger does in the film — it gets enough about the world right to work. I will admit to being deeply entertained by the sight of Israel Defense Forces vet Gadot taking apart the Egyptian King of Crude's security force after the tycoon wishes for the colonizers to be pushed into the sea.\\n\\nWonder Woman 1984 won't top my Washington DC Area Film Critics Association nominations for best picture. But I'd be shocked if it didn't win the group's Joe Barber Award for Best Portrayal of Washington, D.C. More movies that purport to care about the capital and what happens here should take note.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nAD"}

And while come critics of the program might wonder about recipients' access to the Internet, Wonkblog's Rachel Premack reported in July that connectivity is less of a problem than transportation:\\n\\nAccess to at-home Internet is somewhat more common among the poor than access to a car — 88 percent vs. 79.6 percent . Take Mobile, Ala., where a third of residents are both below poverty level and live farther than half a mile from the nearest supermarket. Ninety-one percent of those below the poverty line have Internet access, and only 76 percent have a car. The option of home-delivered groceries, assuming the Internet access is fast enough to use the websites of grocery providers, could make life less stressful.\\n\\nPoor families might also choose to shop online for the same reason middle-class families do: They'll get extra time to spend at work or with their families, instead of shopping at a brick-and-mortar store. On the most basic level, time spent with children is a luxury low-income parents often cannot afford, Clio Chang wrote in a report for the Century Foundation. Emotional neglect can adversely affect childhood development.\\n\\nTo prevent fraud, SNAP purchases must have a higher level of security than other online purchases, the news release notes. The most recent statistics on stamp trafficking, one form of food stamp fraud, peg it at 1.3 percent nationwide.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSNAP grew significantly after the recession, but the number of caseloads has declined in recent years, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

{"original": "There is public interest value in the preservation of those stories, said Alex Howard, a government transparency advocate who previously served as deputy director of the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, has been one of the most prominent users of Instagram Stories. She's offered voters everything from videos of herself preparing Instant Pot macaroni and cheese to a behind-the-scenes look at her time on the Hill. Just yesterday she used it to respond to a CBS News 60 Minutes piece about her.\\n\\nAnd ephemeral messaging is only becoming more prevalent in the run-up to the 2020 campaign: Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance, cracked open a beer in her Instagram Story last week after announcing her presidential bid. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who's weighing a 2020 run, was a frequent Instagram Stories user during his 2018 campaign for senator, showing personal moments even after he lost of himself eating guacamole while driving.\\n\\nBut these Stories no longer exist on their Instagram accounts — and Howard says the public shouldn't have to simply rely on journalists or other observers to screenshot them for posterity. Ocasio-Cortez's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on her use of social media or whether they were archiving the ephemeral stories in any way.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn a stark contrast from federal agencies and the White House, which must comply with strict record-keeping rules, members of Congress have broad discretion over what they archive.\\n\\nHoward thinks it's time for new record-keeping rules, including ones account for social media and disappearing posts. Though much of the data created by congressional committees and administrative officers is considered official records and archived, individual members can decide what to do with papers and content created by their own offices. It's considered their personal property, and they can determine what they want to preserve. There's lots of reasons that politicians choose not to have things be archived, Howard says.\\n\\nCompare that to how the executive branch has handled social media. The Presidential Records Act, which went into effect in 1978, mandated that all official presidential records belong to the public. Presidents have kept this law in mind even when using new technologies. For instance, when the White House joined Snapchat in 2016, a senior Obama White House official told BuzzFeed that it would fully comply with those requirements, saving and preserving Snaps for archives.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the short-term, Howard would like to see technology companies step up and create archives of photos and videos that verified politicians post to their accounts. He wants journalists and researchers to be able to access these posts, even if the politicians themselves are not preserving them. He said the archives could be similar to those that some technology companies have set up under intense political pressure to allow third parties to review political ads purchased on their platforms.\\n\\nThat would be the patch, Howard said. [The companies] created a bug in our democratic system of accountability.\\n\\nRight now politicians largely use this new form of social media to highlight light moments and seem more down-to-earth to voters, but some are worried about the impact this technology could have when it is used for more important policy announcements.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAn Xiao Mina, the author of the upcoming book Memes to Movements, said in a tweet that the posts might seem innocuous because they are interesting selfie videos of cooking meals and attending orientation. But she warned disappearing posts could present problems as people try to document and understand the rise of political leaders:\\n\\nHoward said on Sunday that Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro's use of Instagram Stories put a fine point on the fact that the trend has extended beyond U.S. politicians:\\n\\nThe controversy over Instagram Stories highlights the challenge for technology companies as the tools they created to connect friends are increasingly being used for political messaging — perhaps with consequences they never intended.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt is one of the idiosyncrasies of this moment that we are in where private companies are hosting public squares, Howard said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBITS, NIBBLES AND BYTES\\n\\nBITS: The big Apple news at this year's CES technology show will be the company's woes in China — a stark departure from the role the company's gadgets typically play in driving news at the annual Las Vegas trade show, Bloomberg News's Selina Wang and Mark Gurman report. It's going to be the elephant in the room at CES, Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Bloomberg News. This has been dark days for Apple and for the tech industry. I think there's a lot of questions in regards to the smartphone industry going forward, especially with what Apple said about with demand in China.\\n\\nApple's warning that its sales would fall short last week has contributed to fears about an economic slowdown and the overall stability of the technology sector. Apple is set to encounter multiple hurdles in China this year amid the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing as well as increasing competition from local rivals, Reuters's Josh Horwitz and Stephen Nellis reported. Apple also faces a preliminary injunction by a Chinese court banning sales of several iPhone models, but the ban has not been enforced yet. Apple is not expected to roll out a 5G phone in China before next year, which would place it behind competitors including Huawei, Xiaomi and Samsung, Reuters also reported.\\n\\nThe iPhone XR in particular struggles to convince Chinese consumers, as the Wall Street Journal's Yoko Kubota noted. The XR hasn't sold as expected in China because it is being passed over by both price-conscious buyers and status seekers, analysts say, Kubota wrote. Some Chinese consumers have perceived the sticker price of 6,499 yuan, or about $945, to be too expensive even though it is at least 25% cheaper than the higher-end iPhone XS and XS Max models.\\n\\nNIBBLES: Democratic operatives and a research firm who played a role in an online effort to influence a 2017 U.S. Senate race in Alabama to help elect Democrat Doug Jones are distancing themselves from the initiative's most controversial tactics that were inspired by Russian disinformation, according to The Washington Post's Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe operation, called Project Birmingham, used tactics such as a false flag effort to create bogus evidence that Russian bots supported Jones's Republican opponent Roy Moore on Twitter, according to a 12-page document obtained by The Post. Another component of Project Birmingham was the creation of a deceitful Facebook page targeting conservative voters in Alabama and aiming to hamper Moore's campaign.\\n\\nIn a second online effort against Moore, progressive Democratic operatives posed as conservatives on Facebook and Twitter and claimed to be part of a Dry Alabama movement that supported the Republican candidate, according to the New York Times's Scott Shane and Alan Blinder. The Times reported that the Democratic operatives thought associating Mr. Moore with calls for a statewide alcohol ban would hurt him with moderate, business-oriented Republicans and help Jones.\\n\\nBYTES: Ford is set to start testing self-driving vehicles in the nation's capital early this year, and officials in Washington and other cities are working to anticipate how technological changes in transportation will affect their communities, according to The Post's Michael Laris. D.C. and other cities partnered with the Aspen Institute and Bloomberg Philanthropies to set common goals for developers of driverless cars. High on the list of priorities is cutting greenhouse gases and other pollution, eliminating congestion and ensuring that officials have the opportunity to adapt as changes barrel ahead, Michael wrote. The initiative also includes Los Angeles, Austin, London, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and other cities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen we think about the future of our city, we see less single-occupancy vehicle trips, more vehicle electrification and an emphasis on building the infrastructure and policy framework to support those goals, Jeff Marootian, director of the District Department of Transportation, told my colleague. For instance, the city added electric buses to its Circulator fleet and has started a push to convert more than 75,000 streetlights into LEDs that save energy, according to Marootian.\\n\\nPRIVATE CLOUD\\n\\n-- The Internet and Television Association (known as NCTA), Cable Labs and Cable Europe talked exclusively with me about their plans for 10G broadband networks, an initiative they plan to unveil at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week.\\n\\nSuch a network would be about ten times as fast as the current speeds available to most consumers today, NCTA President Michael Powell tells me. Lab trials of the technology are already underway, and they expect field trials to begin in 2020. He says broadband at these speeds could enable a host of new technologies, by enabling better video streaming or making it easier to use connected home devices. Both trends are expected to be in the spotlight this week at the annual trade show.\\n\\nIt's more than just watching 'House of Cards,' Powell said. He's hoping faster broadband speeds will enable innovations in fields like healthcare, where the technology could enable new ways to process medical images and videos. Powell's comments come as 5G , the fifth generation of cell networks technology, is setting the agenda at CES. Powell tells me every evolution in the mobile networks needs to be met with new technology in broadband networks. The country critically needs both, Powell said.\\n\\n— In a report exploring JPMorgan Chase's relationship with Amazon, the Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer, Laura Stevens and AnnaMaria Andriotis described how the bank imitates some of the management practices that Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos established at the online retail giant. Mr. Bezos notoriously banned slide presentations to keep Amazon in startup mode as it grew, instead asking employees to craft six-page documents complete with a press release and FAQs, according to the Journal. Over roughly the past 18 months, JPMorgan has started a similar practice in its consumer businesses under Gordon Smith, the bank's co-president and co-chief operating officer, [JPMorgan] employees said. JPMorgan has also embraced Bezos's Customer Obsession, an approach requiring employees to start developing products with consumers in mind and then work backward, per the Journal.

The 25 percent tariffs enacted in August are hurting the company's profitability, according to Tesla. Increased tariffs on this particular part cause economic harm to Tesla, through the increase of costs and impact to profitability, Tesla said in a request to the government for tariff exemption, as Shepardson reported. The company also said in the request that it has not been able to find another supplier with the required specifications, at the volume requested and under the timelines necessary for Tesla's continued growth.\\n\\n— More technology news from the public sector:\\n\\nFAST FWD\\n\\n— Four of the nine scheduled keynote speakers at CES this year are women, a sign that the event's organizers are starting to promote gender equity at the technology show, the Associated Press's Barbara Ortutay reported. The activist group GenderAvenger recently gave CES a Gold Stamp of Approval for the show's lineup. The group said the keynote and featured speakers include 45 percent of women, 60 percent of whom are women of color.\\n\\nBut really leveling the playing field often means more than inviting female CEOs to speak, Ortutay wrote.

{"original": "Stocks surged after Powell's remarks, with the Dow Jones industrial average leaping more than 600 points in late-morning trading. The Fed has forecast two interest rate hikes this year, but Wall Street traders and Trump don't want any. Powell's comments indicate the Fed might be revising its views.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWith the muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said during a panel discussion at the American Economic Association annual meeting alongside former Fed chairs Janet L. Yellen and Ben Bernanke. We're always prepared to shift the stance of policy and to shift it significantly if necessary.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly accused Powell of raising interest rates so fast that it's hurting the economy, but the Fed argues that the economy is expanding faster than normal and no longer needs low rates to stimulate growth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter the central bank raised interest rates in December, Trump asked advisers if it's possible to fire Powell, an unprecedented move that many think isn't legally possible since a Fed governor can only be removed for cause.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWhen asked Friday if he would step down if Trump asked, Powell said simply, no.\\n\\nThe president picked Powell for the Fed's top job in late 2017 but has quickly soured on him after the Fed raised interest rates a full percentage point last year, an action that can slow the economy. Several of Trump's top aides have said publicly that the president can't fire Powell because Fed appointees can only be removed for cause, which courts have interpreted as criminal activity.\\n\\nThe Fed chair said that he hasn't spoken with Trump, although Powell indicated he would be willing to meet with the president. I can't think of any Fed chairs who didn't eventually meet with the president, Powell said while seated alongside Yellen and Bernanke.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLarry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, said he thinks a meeting between Trump and Powell will happen and that it will help both sides to talk through their differences. But Kudlow and Powell said no meeting has been scheduled yet.\\n\\nIt would be nice to have a frank and a candid exchange up close and personal, Kudlow said Friday morning in an interview on Bloomberg TV. President Trump would benefit. I think Jay Powell would benefit.\\n\\nPowell vowed repeatedly Friday that the central bank would be flexible as it decides whether to continue raising interest rates in 2019. Yellen supported the strategy, saying the Fed is in a good position to maintain that flexibility.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAll three said the U.S. economy would grow at a slower rate this year than last but that they saw little sign of a recession.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt's likely the economy will grow more slowly in 2019 than 2018, Bernanke said. This is not something that is news. We've anticipated this for a long time because it was clear the stimulus would be dying down over time.\\n\\nYellen added that growth is still likely to end up being above the growth rate of potential, which is consistent with a strong labor market and maybe even some further tightening.\\n\\nThe Fed recently cut its forecast for growth in 2019 to 2.3 percent (down from 2.5 percent) as concerns grow about the stock market correction and the slowdown in China and Europe dragging down the U.S. economy. But Fed leaders still insist that is above trend and very healthy growth.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nUnemployment has been under 4 percent for nine months now. We have inflation under control. I think that's a pretty good outcome, and we sure think it can continue, Powell said, adding that he feels fine about capital markets.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPowell's optimism was bolstered Friday when the Labor Department announced the economy added 312,000 jobs in December, blowing out expectations and capping the best year of job growth since 2015.\\n\\nIf the U.S. economy keeps growing through July, this will be the longest expansion in U.S. history. Bernanke predicted the economy would achieve this milestone and that people shouldn't fear an immediate downturn just because the nation has never experienced economic growth for this long.\\n\\nExpansions don't die of old age.

The bottom line is President Trump did nothing wrong, and the Republican Party is more united than ever behind him. I, along with the GOP, stand with President Trump.\\n\\nWhether the thirst for vengeance against Romney is sustained will hinge on Trump, who has long smarted from the Utah Republican's criticism of him and takes pride in hitting back at perceived and real enemies.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nParty and campaign officials said privately that they hoped Trump wouldn't obsess over the lone defection and move on from impeachment, basking in his acquittal instead of engaging in a days-long tiff with Romney. The president has firm control of the party and could dictate a strategy that is more aggressive, advisers said, if his pique at Romney flares.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump told advisers in recent weeks that he was more worried about Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) than Romney, according to people who heard his comments. In the end, Collins and Murkowski voted with the president.\\n\\nTrump is scheduled to speak about the Senate vote to acquit him of the two House impeachment charges at the White House on Thursday — an event that will serve as an indication whether he's ready to move on from Romney's vote or try to make him another of example of what happens to Republicans who cross him.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRomney said he couldn't let concerns over breaking with his party guide his vote, which he cast as one of conscience and rooted in his religious beliefs.\\n\\nI am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision, and in some quarters, I will be vehemently denounced, Romney said on the Senate floor. I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters. Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe senator said he had not slept past 4 a.m. since the Senate impeachment trial began last month, wrestling over how he should vote, and eventually decided to buck the president because he saw the evidence that Trump pressured the leader of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals as overwhelming.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRomney told The Washington Post that he asked the White House for more information about actions taken toward Ukraine, particularly concerning acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but none was provided. He wanted former national security adviser John Bolton to testify, which he said could have potentially raised reasonable doubt that the president did anything wrong and lead him to vote to acquit. The Senate rejected subpoenaing Bolton.\\n\\nRepublican and campaign officials said among the steps that could be taken to punish Romney are continued attacks on Twitter or through paid advertisements. Trump allies could also help fund an opponent in his state, although he's not up for reelection until 2024, or push operatives or donors not to support or work for him. White House officials could block policy or budget priorities that Romney wants, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA senior Trump campaign official said the longer the Romney news cycle drags on, the worse it is for the president, because it focuses attention on his impeachment. Advisers were encouraging Trump to not dignify Romney's vote with a response, and there were no immediate plans to campaign against Romney.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIrrelevant relic, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote on Twitter.\\n\\n\\n\\nLittle punch. Move on. It's over, one senior campaign official said, to describe the strategy. We were already done with him.\\n\\nRomney's colleagues are highly unlikely to kick him out of the Senate Republican conference, but the president's allies could push for such a move and make life uncomfortable for Romney and his colleagues. While several senators criticized Romney's vote, many were quick to oppose giving him the boot.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI'm glad Mitt is a Republican, said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he was surprised and disappointed with Romney's vote but said the Utah Republican was largely supportive of the president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe don't have any doghouses here. The most important vote is the next vote, he said.\\n\\nMcDaniel issued the statement quickly to make clear whose side she was on and to get ahead of potential stories that were likely to question her loyalty to the president if she remained silent, a Republican official said. She did not receive a heads-up from her uncle and the president did not ask her to put out a statement, according to the official.\\n\\nThe White House did not receive an advance notice of Romney's decision, though some aides were preparing for the idea that he would go against the president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNeither Trump nor White House staff lobbied Romney, according to aides. It wouldn't have helped, said one senior White House aide directly involved in the impeachment process.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nStill, Trump takes particular pride in Republicans sticking with him, regularly peppering aides with questions about any Republican defections on legislation. During impeachment, he repeatedly told advisers that he wanted a bipartisan acquittal — hoping to get at least one Democrat to vote with him, and for Republicans to stick together.\\n\\nNo Democrats voted to acquit the president, leaving Romney as the only senator to break with his party.\\n\\nThe president spent much of a weekend in early October attacking Romney on Twitter, but advisers said that was largely designed to telegraph to other Republicans that they should not buck the president.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nParty officials said they did not give instructions for anyone to call for Romney's expulsion from the party, but one Republican fundraiser said that donors who once supported Romney are now solidly behind Trump. As the Republican Party noted in its release attacking Romney, the president is more popular than the senator in Utah.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI suspect that donors and operatives are not going to be allowed to play both sides of the field. They are going to have to choose, said Andrew Surabian, a Republican strategist and adviser to Donald Trump Jr. He is going to be considered a pariah moving forward.\\n\\nTrump has complained that he endorsed Romney in both 2012 for president and 2018 for Senate and that Romney has taken every chance he can to hurt him, including an op-ed attacking the president soon after he joined the Senate in early 2019. Trump met with Romney after he won the election in 2016, and advisers said he was considering him for secretary of state — though he was never likely to get the nomination.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAides note Romney was at the White House twice in November, including for a lengthy meeting on vaping in the Roosevelt Room.\\n\\nDuring a November Oval Office meeting with political advisers, some suggested attacking Romney but Trump told them to hold off, hoping he would stick with Republicans on impeachment.\\n\\nPeople close to Romney say he knows where he currently stands in the Republican Party — on an island — but will not be cowed by Trump's attacks. While he agrees with Trump regularly on policy, his advisers said he sees standing up against some of Trump's behavior as a moral imperative.\\n\\nHe's not someone who operates from a center of fear. I don't think it had anything to do with his decision, said Stuart Stevens, a former adviser to Romney and a critic of Trump. He tried to look at this as if, what would he do if a Democrat was in office? He wanted to be a true juror. He took it very seriously. I think Mitt Romney will sleep very well tonight.\\n\\nBrendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D.

Several of them abused pain medications.\\n\\nI was not a user, so they would ask me if I'd turn them in. My typical response: Do what you want to do, but if I catch you high on the worksite, or operating a piece of equipment, I'll make sure you never work here again.\\n\\n(Monica Akhtar,Erin Patrick O'Connor/The Washington Post)\\n\\nMy attitude did not change after I began working in a mine closer to home just outside Clintwood, Va. The company I worked for, one of the largest in the region, had a zero-tolerance drug-abuse policy. But the problem was still apparent. We would lose a few co-workers with each random drug test, and stories abounded about smaller mines in neighboring states losing entire work crews.\\n\\nSome may judge me for not turning people in. But before I rushed to judgment, I considered the reasons they were addicted, and how they were living.\\n\\nCoal mining is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, underground bituminous coal miners are three times more likely to suffer serious injuries and illnesses than workers in any other private industry.\\n\\nMany of those I worked with who were abusing were not pill heads. They had weighed a difficult choice: take pain medication to be able to continue to work, or risk fighting for disability compensation that's seldom enough to pay the bills. Those taking medication on the job were often ashamed of their dependency. In many cases, they avoided working in positions that could get someone hurt.\\n\\nMine regulatory agencies have made efforts to reduce the problem, encouraging coal companies to work with miners facing addiction and requiring mandatory drug testing. Few miners will seek help, however, fearing that admitting a drug problem would ensure a pink slip when layoffs came down the line. Even if they decided to risk entering a recovery program offered by the company, good treatment is hard to come by in our area.\\n\\nIn Clintwood, there is only one rehabilitation-detox facility around. It is an hour away, accepts only private insurance or direct payment, is perpetually booked, has lengthy waiting periods, and keeps a few beds available for those taken into custody by law enforcement. The only treatment alternative is a methadone clinic a similar distance away, where the addiction is switched over and controlled. Again, the patient must have private insurance or pay out of pocket.\\n\\nIf a miner does manage to get clean, he still has to work every day with pain. It is a dire situation based on economic dependency, and sadly, it has spread far beyond the mining industry and deep into our local communities.\\n\\nWith recent reports showing that many millions of pain pills have been shipped into Appalachia by pharmaceutical companies, evidence is building that the abuse epidemic is not entirely the fault of the addicted. Not only has Wall Street benefited from the trillions of dollars of coal reserves that have been mined here, but it is also continuing to exploit us, reaping profits from the poverty and human suffering left in the wake of a century of coal extraction.\\n\\nOver the past three decades, I have seen many lives destroyed by this epidemic, including a relative who committed suicide, multiple classmates who fatally overdosed, and many more broken families dealing with their addicted loved ones. If we are to end this problem, we need not only the regulations and facilities to deal with it, but also hope for a future free from the dominance of coal."}
{"original": "Playing on his nickname, the Observer newspaper in England once dubbed him The Sundance Kid of the Caribbean.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHe was a considered a White Jamaican with European roots, but he was born and bred on the island and retained his Caribbean accent. As well as his resorts, he founded the daily Jamaica Observer to compete with the island's oldest newspaper, the Gleaner (launched in 1834).\\n\\nLeading a group of investors, he also bought the national airline Air Jamaica in 1994, expanding its routes beyond the Caribbean to destinations including the United States and the United Kingdom. The airline continued to lose money, however, and after Mr. Stewart and his group pulled out in 2004, it bounced between state and private control until it went out of business in 2015.\\n\\nHe twice put his money where his mouth was for Jamaica when its foreign currency holdings were low and democratic socialism was on the rise: First in the 1970s and '80s when he realized the island had to build tourism hotels. Then, in 1992, when the economy was threatened by currency speculators, he pumped $30 million of his own money into Jamaican banks to keep them afloat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMr. Stewart, 79, died Jan. 4 in Miami, according to his son Adam Stewart, who now takes over the Sandals Resorts International empire and who did not give a specific cause of death. He did say that his father had received a recent medical diagnosis but had kept it quiet so as not to worry his friends or workers. In May last year he had donated $31.5 million to Jamaican authorities to help families suffering from the coronavirus.\\n\\nGordon Arthur Cyril Stewart was born in the Jamaican capital Kingston on July 6, 1941. His father had been brought to Jamaica from England as a baby and became a radio maintenance technician at the state-run Jamaica Broadcasting Corp., while his mother ran an appliance dealership.\\n\\nHe first went to school at Campion Hall Jesuit preparatory school in Kingston, where a priest once dubbed him the most unlikely to succeed in life, and later in the parish of St. Ann on Jamaica's north coast. He was sent to England to complete his education at a school in London.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBy 10, he was obsessed by the sea and soon began to find any ways to make money. From a tree trunk, he built himself a dugout canoe; later he bought a bigger boat, caught fish and sold it to local hotels. He also learned he could make decent bucks by taking wealthy visitors from their yachts to shore and back.\\n\\nAccording to his friend, Jamaica Observer founding editor Desmond Allen, he once took glamorous British actress Joan Collins to a secluded reef where she proceeded to have a nude dip. He was still a boy, and she did not invite him to join her. (He could only have dreamed then that he would one day own his own 132-foot, $5 million yacht, the Lady Sandals, on which he sailed until shortly before his death.)\\n\\nHe was in his early 20s when he saw a moneymaking opportunity while the first James Bond film Dr. No (1962), starring Sean Connery, was being shot in Jamaica. He borrowed his father's motorboat to take Connery and the film crew to location sites, including a shipwreck. He was also of a mechanical bent and bought dilapidated cars, spruced them up and sold them for a healthy profit.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAfter his spell at school in London, he returned to Jamaica and soon became a successful sales manager for the Dutch-owned Curacao Trading Co. In 1968, he set up his own company, Appliance Traders Ltd., to sell air-conditioning units, fridges and freezers, and it remains the parent company to Sandal Resorts International.\\n\\nHis son Jonathan died in a car accident in 1989, and Mr. Stewart said he plunged into a months-long depression. Survivors include his third wife, Cheryl, and seven children from his three marriages; his mother; 12 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.\\n\\nMr. Stewart ran into serious controversy in the 1990s when, with the gay rights movement blossoming, he was attacked for his no-gay policy at Sandals resorts. The initial policy, from 1981, was that Sandals resorts, starting with the first one at Montego Bay, would be for couples (heterosexuals) only. At the time, homosexuality was still illegal in Jamaica.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMr. Stewart eventually caught up with the times and abolished the policy in 2004, and the Sandals resorts have continued to prosper. He created the Beaches resorts for families, also a major success.\\n\\nThe anti-gay policy damaged him abroad but not in Jamaica, where he often strolled (without bodyguard) around Kingston to shouts of Mornin', Butch! In his office one morning in 1996, while he lounged in a beige armchair wearing his trademark Harrods of London striped shirt — no tie — and with one foot on a glass coffee table, he was asked by a journalist for the London Independent: What are you worth?\\n\\nI don't have any money. I sank it all into this, he replied, indicating a model of an Air Jamaica jetliner. We come out of a culture that says everything that happens has to be done by the government. More and more people are realizing you've got to do it on your own."}
{"original": "Beginning in 1953, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed an executive order denying work to those suspected of sexual perversion, thousands of gay men and women were forced out of the federal bureaucracy. While the exact number of victims claimed by this lavender scare is difficult to quantify, one scholar estimates that 5,000 to 10,000 people were affected, far exceeding those expelled in the simultaneous (not to mention much more extensively documented and remembered) red scare.\\n\\nMany gay and lesbian workers quietly resigned rather than face humiliating security interrogations, others committed suicide without leaving an explanation, and untold numbers never even applied for jobs due to the prohibition on their employment. It was not until 1995, when President Bill Clinton signed an executive order reversing the Eisenhower measure, that sexual orientation was removed from the list of conditions justifying the denial of a security clearance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe rationale for barring employment to gay people in the intelligence field at the height of the Cold War was twofold. The first, and ostensibly more justifiable one for liberal-minded individuals, was the potential for blackmail. Because homosexuality was legally proscribed in most states until the 1970s and socially anathema, gays were considered more susceptible targets for recruitment by hostile foreign intelligence services than heterosexuals. So shameful was the homosexual's secret, so ruinous to his reputation and livelihood were it exposed, he would presumably do anything, including betray his country, to keep it concealed.\\n\\nThe genesis for this belief lay in the career of Col. Alfred Redl. A gay man and senior counterintelligence official in the Austro-Hungarian army, Redl was caught selling secrets for a hefty sum to Russia in 1913. Redl's motivation was pure greed; his homosexuality was not even known to his Russian handler, nor would its exposure necessarily have ruined a military career in late Belle Époque Vienna. However, hoping to downplay the embarrassment of a mole at the very top of its counterintelligence apparatus, the military leaked that Redl was gay and had been blackmailed by the Russians over it.\\n\\nThe revelation of Redl's treason just before the outbreak of World War I inflated the case's significance in the public imagination. Over time, the tale of the traitorous, gay spy became lore, especially among intelligence professionals, dramatized onstage and in film. Five decades after Redl was handed a pistol and instructed to take his own life as punishment for treason, Central Intelligence Agency Director Allen Dulles included an account of the legend in an anthology he edited and wrote elsewhere that the Austrian colonel suffered from two weaknesses — homosexuality and overwhelming venality.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIndicative of how damaging homosexuality was considered to be at the time was the best-selling 1959 novel of Washington politics Advise and Consent, later made into a hit film directed by Otto Preminger. The book's plot centered around a patriotic senator who committed suicide after one of his unscrupulous colleagues threatened to expose a fleeting, gay wartime affair. Although Advise and Consent was unusual for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay character, it nevertheless presented the homosexual's plight as so drastic that death was considered preferable to having his secret disclosed.\\n\\nFears about gay Americans being susceptible to blackmail hardened significantly during the Cold War. Previously, the intelligence community's homophobic attitude had been leavened by pragmatism. In 1950 testimony before a closed congressional committee investigating gay people in federal employment, Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the first director of the Central Intelligence Agency, categorically declared that his agency will never employ a homosexual on its rolls. Nonetheless, Hillenkoetter admitted it might be necessary, and had been valuable in the past, to use known homosexual agents in the field. Hillenkoetter assumed this tactic would be acceptable to members of Congress, because espionage, like homosexuality, was at best an extremely dirty business.\\n\\nHillenkoetter alluded to a case that year involving a Soviet intelligence operation wherein our task will be made considerably easier by the appearance in the area of a known homosexual who we think will be extremely helpful in this particular case.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis openness to the potential recruitment of gay people in intelligence work was ultimately cast aside as the Cold War inspired a second, more insidious, rationale for denying security clearances to gays: that subversive sexuality inclined one to subversive politics. The specter of a Homosexual International, sinister, mysterious, efficient, was conjured to accompany the all-powerful Communist one. A series of high-profile cases involving homosexuality and communist espionage bolstered this prejudice.\\n\\nIn 1948, Time magazine journalist Whittaker Chambers testified that he had been a courier for the communist underground in the 1930s and that Alger Hiss, a former State Department official, was a member of his cell. While Chambers's sexuality was not explicitly raised at the time, Hiss's allies strongly insinuated that the ex-communist's allegations were motivated by a desire to seek revenge against the man who had spurned his romantic overtures.\\n\\nLikewise, when British diplomats Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean defected to the Soviet Union in 1951, and two National Security Agency cryptologists, William Martin and Bernon Mitchell, fled to Moscow in 1960, many attributed their defections to deviant sexualities.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlthough Burgess was openly gay and Mitchell had once admitted to bestiality in his youth, there was no indication that either's sexuality played a role in their treachery. Nonetheless, pressure from the FBI over the Burgess affair led the British government to adopt a policy aimed at eliminating homosexuals from the Foreign Service, and media portrayed Martin and Mitchell as lovers.\\n\\nThe sad irony of these fears is that neither reason for keeping gay Americans from working in intelligence was based in reality. Never in American history was there a recorded case of a gay person compromised by a foreign power due to fears of his or her sexual orientation being exposed. The more realistic scenario was that exemplified by anti-communist newspaper columnist Joe Alsop in 1957. When the KGB entrapped him having sex with another man in a Moscow hotel room, Alsop marched straight to the American Embassy and composed a statement acknowledging the incident and his homosexuality. Years later, when incriminating photographs of the encounter were mailed anonymously across Washington, Alsop refused to desist in his harsh criticisms of the Soviet regime.\\n\\nMoreover, it never seemed to cross the minds of intelligence professionals like Roscoe Hillenkoetter or the senators questioning him that a gay person was by necessity someone skilled at keeping secrets in a homophobic society and therefore might actually be predisposed for espionage work.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 1969 Stonewall uprising against police harassment at a Greenwich Village bar is widely cited as the catalyst for the gay rights movement. But a proper understanding of the struggle for equality must include the activism that began a decade earlier in Washington, D.C., where the federal government's discrimination against gay and lesbian Americans compelled a small number of heroic men and women to organize and lobby for their rights."}
{"original": "Republicans have similarly returned leaders to power even though some members objected, as in 2015, when Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) likewise narrowly secured reelection as House speaker, despite dissent.\\n\\nWhy do the political parties tend to reelect leaders despite persistent opposition from their ranks? Parties make a critical trade-off. They empower strong leaders to advance the party's agenda. But those leaders are then harder to remove because they can exploit the position's powers to buy off dissenting party members and keep the job.\\n\\nThis is what my research shows\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMy research uses game theory to understand why legislators write rules that make their leaders difficult to remove from office. I support my claims by comparing my predictions to patterns of leadership transitions over the past 150 years of congressional history.\\n\\nParties face a dilemma when writing rules. If the rules weaken leaders — for example, by taking away their right to nominate members for the Rules Committee — those leaders may not be able to pass important parts of the party's policy agenda. But if the rules make leaders powerful, it becomes harder for opponents to challenge them, even if a large faction prefers new leaders.\\n\\nSince the early 1990s, both parties have decided in favor of having powerful leaders who are difficult to remove. A variety of factors shape this decision: increasing ideological unity within each party, rising polarization between the parties, the greater importance of the president in making laws and more intense competition between the parties for control of the chamber in the next election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHow does Pelosi maintain power?\\n\\nHouse chamber and Democratic rules grant party leaders influence in virtually every important organizational decision made in the House. Since the November elections, Pelosi has deployed these resources to chip away at the 66-member faction that initially declined to endorse her reelection as speaker. That included creating a leadership position for Rep. Barbara Lee; reviving the House administration subcommittee on elections for Rep. Marcia L. Fudge to chair; and promising the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group within the House that advocates bipartisan cooperation, that she would let moderates share control over which bills and amendments come to the floor for a vote.\\n\\nPelosi's entrenchment echoes that of Boehner (2011-2015): The Ohio Republican used his control over committee assignments and appointments to various leadership offices to co-opt every GOP House member who could plausibly have challenged him for the speakership.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTo be sure, Boehner never tamed the fractious members of the tea party movement. He ultimately chose to retire to avoid a government shutdown. Still, no credible challenger ever ran against him, suggesting how firmly Boehner neutralized potential rivals.\\n\\nPast partisans often preferred weaker leaders\\n\\nParties have not always resolved the trade-off in this way. Throughout most of the 20th century, the rules made party leaders weak enough to remove from office, even though this limited their ability to impose party discipline. As a result, leaders did not enjoy the control over committee assignments, the congressional agenda or the choice of committee chairs that they have today.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOnly the most exceptional leaders — such as speakers Nicholas Longworth (R), 1925-1931, and Sam Rayburn (D), 1940-1961 — won de facto control over these resources. Party members recognized their talent as leaders and deferred to their judgment on important organizational matters. With leaders deemed less worthy, partisans successfully deposed, sidelined or pressured into retirement speakers such as Charles Halleck (R), 1959-1965; Frederick Gillett (R) 1919-1925; and John McCormack (D) 1962-1971.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis system had serious shortcomings. When party members could not find or agree upon someone who commanded widespread respect within the majority party, the House struggled to pass legislation on important policy priorities. For example, McCormack failed to pass most of the Kennedy legislative program in the 87th Congress, between 1961 and 1963, despite a large Democratic majority.\\n\\nAs parties became more ideologically unified and the competition between the parties became fiercer, this drawback became unacceptable. But a leader who engendered dissent within the party like Pelosi likely would not have survived.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPelosi's concessions are unlikely to undermine her power\\n\\nIf Democrats want to change the rules to prevent their leaders from entrenching themselves, they will have to wait until Pelosi leaves office. Since Pelosi was elected House minority leader in 2006, she has used her tremendous power to render harmless the few concessions she has had to make to her party.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nConsider the rule changes to which Pelosi reportedly agreed. The changes guarantee bills and amendments that have substantial bipartisan support will be brought to a vote. Pelosi would be obliged to bring to a vote any bill that can attract 290 co-sponsors.\\n\\nBut that is not a significant change. The rules already enable a coalition of 218 legislators to pass a discharge petition that would compel a floor vote. The new rule would hardly make a dent on the leadership's power to set the agenda. The other promised changes have such large loopholes that Pelosi still has full discretion over what will and will not receive a vote on the House floor.\\n\\nLikewise, Pelosi's pledge to retire from the speakership after four more years is only a token concession. In 2022, she will be 82, the oldest person to have ever served as House speaker. She will have served as the top Democrat in the House for 19 years. If a Democrat is elected president in 2020, Pelosi will hold the reins during the typically productive first term and depart just in time to avoid blame for any setbacks during the 2022 midterm election. And if the Republican experience provides any guidance, Democrats may remove the limit should she have a change of heart."}

If Trump and lawmakers can strike an immigration deal, negotiators on both sides think that other issues, including how to fund a children's health insurance program and a roughly $80 billion package to pay for disaster relief, could be resolved.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThese former congressional interns share why the battle in Congress over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is so personal. (Melissa Macaya, Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\\n\\nAhead of the meeting, the Trump administration released to lawmakers a request to pay $18 billion over 10 years for a mix of walls, fencing and other security technology. GOP lawmakers have said they were waiting for the plan to know the parameters of talks with Democrats.\\n\\nInstead of the saber-rattling, let's get in a room and figure out reasonable, sound policy for securing the border, helping [dreamers] . . . and solving this problem for the first time in two decades, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), a lead GOP immigration negotiator, told Fox News Channel on Sunday.\\n\\nBut Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who voted against the temporary spending plan in December, characterized the looming shutdown as an opportunity for Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI believe that if we can increase voter turnout by 5 percent from 2014, Democrats will regain the House and Senate. But you cannot do that unless ordinary people believe you are fighting for them, Sanders said in an interview. If it's more tax breaks for billionaires and huge increases in military spending, you have a lot of working people and young people who will say: 'It doesn't make a difference. Why should I be involved?' \\n\\nHere's a look at the dreamers whose DACA protections are set to expire. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)\\n\\nRepublicans control Congress but Democrats hold significant leverage over spending talks. In the House, hard-liners on the right have regularly voted against recent spending bills, requiring GOP leaders to rely on at least some Democratic votes to pass. In the Senate, spending bills require at least 60 votes to avoid procedural hurdles, and Republicans only hold 51 seats.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a lead Democratic negotiator on immigration, called Trump's detailed request outrageous and said he would continue working instead with Republicans who understand what is at stake in hopes of striking a bipartisan deal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nProgressives such as Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), whose Harlem-area district is home to more than 2,000 constituents protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, said he will continue voting against GOP spending plans that don't include protections. Over the holiday recess, he said DACA was the issue I heard about the most when I'm walking in my district.\\n\\nEvery time it's delayed, the movement just gets stronger, the outcry gets louder, he added.\\n\\nProgressive groups are planning to apply fresh pressure on Democrats who voted to temporarily extend government funding in December without addressing DACA — a mix of moderates facing reelection this year in states Trump won in 2016 and others from states with sizable populations of federal government workers.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe are laser-focused on January 19 as a do-or-die moment, said Greisa Martinez, advocacy director for United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group organizing protests on Capitol Hill against Republicans and Democrats who have voted for previous GOP spending bills.\\n\\nAlthough the situation facing dreamers is a crisis that was created by Donald Trump, Martinez said Democrats are not without power, especially now that Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) has joined the caucus. They have a closer margin now, and we expect them to meet their public and private commitment to us that they'll use every leverage they have.\\n\\nIndivisible, the progressive grass-roots network of citizen groups, said it will focus its efforts on six Democratic senators from left-leaning states — Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall of New Mexico and Tim Kaine and Mark R. Warner of Virginia. Kaine, Stabenow and Heinrich face reelection this year.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDemocrats have done a poor job of playing hardball, said Angel Padilla, the group's policy director. They said for three months they would use their leverage in December to get this done, and that didn't happen. In order to have leverage, the other side has to believe you'll use that leverage, and I don't think that [Republicans] think that [Democrats] will use that leverage.\\n\\nSpokesmen for the senators said the lawmakers support dreamers but had various reasons for backing the last spending bill.\\n\\nUdall said a government shutdown would be a disaster for New Mexico and the 45,000 residents who work for the federal agencies and research labs in his state.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Kaine, whose state is home to hundreds of thousands of federal employees, said he will keep pushing for a solution for dreamers and he'll evaluate a deal once he's seen it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDespite Trump's renewed calls for a border wall, Republicans remain frayed over how to move forward. Some moderates are willing to either pass a bill giving dreamers a path to citizenship or craft a deal with Democrats that would include some border security measures. But the bulk of the conservative rank-and-file want more in exchange for accepting an immigration policy that much of the Republican base opposes.\\n\\nAs the fulcrum of the immigration talks has shifted decisively toward the Senate, lawmakers on the hard right are pressuring House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to be more assertive. They are wary that House members will get jammed with a Senate bill that they will have no choice but to pass mainly with Democratic votes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, said it was essential that House Republicans pass a stand-alone immigration bill that promotes conservative priorities in line with Trump's agenda.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf the only thing you do is wait for something the Senate can pass, then what we might as well do is have the House recess for the next nine months, he said. Allowing Democrats to dictate immigration policy at a time of Republican control of Congress and the White House is distasteful and certainly not in keeping with what we promised the American people.\\n\\nAmid a slate of partisan and bipartisan proposals, another conservative immigration plan may emerge in the coming days. According to a lawmaker and a GOP aide familiar with the plans, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) is expected to unveil a bill as soon as this week that would address DACA in exchange for a raft of conservative priorities on immigration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGoodlatte's plan would grant legal status to DACA recipients, provide funding for a border wall, end a visa lottery program criticized by Trump, take action against sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and roll back rules allowing legal immigrants to sponsor the entry of certain family members. But House Republican leaders do not think the bill will be able to garner enough support to pass by the deadline.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA spokeswoman for Goodlatte declined to comment.\\n\\nBipartisan immigration talks in the House have produced little visible progress. A bipartisan group of moderates, the Problem Solvers Caucus, created an immigration task force that formed the outlines of a deal, said Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.), one of the participants, but the larger caucus wouldn't sign on.\\n\\nWe're not there right now, and we're going to start working on it again when we come back, Coffman said.\\n\\nAshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said he was continuing to speak with lawmakers in both chambers but isn't committed to permitting a vote on a bill granting dreamers a path to citizenship.\\n\\nBeyond DACA, Republicans and Democrats say they're making progress over how much money should go to the military vs. domestic programs, something that has to be settled to raise automatic spending caps.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe White House wants to set discretionary defense spending levels at about $603 billion, which would exceed current automatic spending caps by $54 billion. Republicans think non-defense levels should see less of an increase, closer to $35 billion. But Democrats are insisting on parity, arguing in recent weeks that non-defense spending bolsters programs to fight opioid addiction and terrorism and protect the southern border.\\n\\nSanders said he would urge Congress to reject any deal that increases military spending by more than what is spent on domestic programs. If we're going to spend a dollar more in the military, we must spend a dollar more on the enormously important issues facing working families. All of these issues are in crisis mode, and they have to be dealt with right now."}
{"original": "If you're doing any Cargill-related business – if for example you have a conference call and you think you should take it from home on your commute into work in the morning — that's absolutely not acceptable, company spokeswoman April Nelson said. She said GPS devices necessary for navigation may be used so long as they are programmed before travel and mounted for hands-free use.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Minnesota-based company, whose new policy applies to about 150,000 employees worldwide, is not the first or the largest to institute such a strict ban. But advocates at the National Safety Council believe Cargill is the largest privately held corporation to do so.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDeborah A.P. Hersman, president and chief executive of the National Safety Council, welcomed the measure, saying history has shown that changing the corporate culture can help shift attitudes in the rest of society. It's also another sign of how many corporations have been trying to do what government – loosely defined – has been ineffective or unwilling to do since mobile phones first appeared 30 years ago, she said.\\n\\nThey're really just looking at their risks and looking at the data, Hersman said.\\n\\nThe National Safety Council says motor vehicle crashes are the most frequent cause of work-related fatalities and account for about 24 percent of all work-related injuries. The nonprofit organization, using 2010 data, estimates that at least 24 percent of all fatal crashes involved drivers using cell phones and that at least 160,000 crashed involved drivers who were texting.\\n\\nIf anything, driving while texting or talking on a mobile device has become ever more widespread since then. Some experts believe that recent statistics showing a dramatic increase in traffic deaths can be blamed at least in part on the widespread habit of texting or talking while driving.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCargill — whose businesses range from agriculture to financial services — decided to act because of the ubiquity of smartphones and a growing number of statistics suggesting that these devices are too often the culprits in traffic crashes, Nelson said. There was no specific incident that caused the company to to implement the policy, she said.\\n\\nOverall, it's making sure employees know of the dangers of driving while distracted and how important that Cargill feels that safety is first, Nelson said.\\n\\nEmployees could be disciplined for infractions, with actions ranging from a talk with the boss to termination, but that will be decided on a case-by-case basis, Nelson said. She said the company is relying mostly on an honor system and peers to monitor and enforce the new policy.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRight now, we are focused on stopping distracted driving and less on what the punishments will be for violating the policy, Nelson said. We will look at factors such as how egregious a violation is, if someone is doing it repeatedly, if they have received warnings in the past, and other factors to determine the appropriate consequences.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe National Safety Council, again citing 2010 figures, says 20 percent of the Fortune 500 companies imposed total bans. Some go so far as to conduct electronic sweeps of company-issued mobile phones to make sure that distracting apps, such as Pokemon Go, are not on them, Hersman said. And a survey cited by the Council found in 2009 that of 469 companies that enacted total mobile phone bans, only 1 percent believed productivity declined.\\n\\nThere's some irony in corporations have reined in the use of mobile phones in vehicles. Hard-charging business people were among the first to see that drivetime didn't have to be downtime with a mobile phone in the car. Some companies still shy away from imposing total bans for fear that productivity might suffer if employees couldn't take business calls in the car with a hands-free device.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut a corporation can be held vicariously responsible for the negligent behavior of an employee if the employee was engaged in work-related activity at the time of a crash. Over the past decade, many companies learned the hard way that they cannot expect employees to be in constant contact without also putting them at risk when they're on the road.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne company was held liable in a crash involving an employee making work-related cold calls while driving to a private event on a Saturday night. In a 2010 case in Texas cited by the Council, a jury awarded a $21 million verdict against a company whose employee was using a hands-free device to talk on a mobile device when she hit another vehicle.\\n\\nSo it's tempting to think that companies are just doing this to cover their fannies in the event that someone takes them to court over a crash. A National Safety Council white paper on the topic notes that if employers can show that they implemented a total ban, educated employees about the policy, monitored their compliance and enforced the policy, they will be in a more defensible position should someone sue them.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut at some level it doesn't matter what the motivation is if it keeps people safe. Hersman said she simply hopes that steps taken by corporations such as Cargill will do for distracted driving what workplace smoking bans did for tobacco use. At one time, smoking was accepted almost everywhere, and now it's not. And people are no longer shy about asking others to put out the cigarette. Hersman said she hopes that eventually, more Americans will no longer view texting while driving as acceptable behavior, either.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou really have to change your mindset to put your employees' safety and the safety of others on the road first, she said."}
{"original": "Adam Staveski, 22, policy analyst, and Maddie Csere, 22, financial analyst. (Photo courtesy of daters)\\n\\nInterviews by Amanda McGrath\\n\\nPolicy analyst Adam Staveski, 22, and financial analyst Maddie Csere, also 22, are fresh-faced and fresh out of local colleges, enjoying their first year as D.C. young professionals. We sent them to Maple in Columbia Heights to see if a shared love of running, economics and a laid-back attitude was enough to spark a fresh romance.\\n\\nMaddie: I was freaking out all week — this is a little out of my comfort zone. I almost didn't come. But within 30 seconds, I was like, This is going to be absolutely fine.\\n\\nAdam: She was exactly my type. She's very pretty, she's friendly and gregarious — our personalities seemed to click right off the bat.\\n\\nMaddie: I know exactly why they paired me with him: He's tall, athletic, has a slimmer build, which is what I said my type was.\\n\\nAdam:We could pick up the conversation like we were old friends.\\n\\nMaddie: He was very kind and definitely excited to be there, which made me excited to be there.\\n\\nAdam: We both grew up in small-town environments [and] came to D.C. for college.\\n\\nMaddie: We both studied economics. He told me about his job, and it was really cool and interesting. I don't get to talk to other econ people that often.\\n\\nAdam: My job is very niche — most people think it's the most boring thing of all time. I was glad she didn't think it was super lame.\\n\\nMaddie: I went to [George Washington University] and he went to American University; we talked about D.C. school rivalries.\\n\\nAdam: It seems like everyone hates Georgetown, but it's like [American] is rivals with [GWU], jockeying for position as the second-best school in D.C.\\n\\nMaddie: I don't know. I don't really believe in the school rivalries.\\n\\nAdam: She said, No, people at GW don't care. I was like, shoot, maybe American kids are way more petty. [Laughs.]\\n\\nMaddie: He's a really good runner. I recently ran a marathon for the first time; he ran the Marine Corps in an insane time and is running [in] Boston next year.\\n\\nAdam: She asked for my time and I said I ran 2:43. She was astounded. I was like, Nice, she's impressed!\\n\\nMaddie: We talked about meeting famous people. I was obsessed with One Direction at one point in my life and met Harry Styles after waiting outside the British Fashion Awards for four hours. It was ridiculous. [Adam] was on The Daily Show once; they came up to him on the street and interviewed him for a segment.\\n\\nAdam: We both found out — weird fact — we're both missing our front teeth.\\n\\nMaddie: We both have fake teeth — I'm pretty sure that's not something I put in my application.\\n\\nAdam: She's very genuine. I'm like, Wow, you are a cool, amazing, interesting person that I'm excited to talk to.\\n\\nMaddie: He's one of the most genuinely nice people I've ever met in my whole life. If you meet him, you immediately know he's not a very judgmental person.\\n\\nAdam: There seemed to be depth to her. She's not predictable. We delved briefly into politics, and rather than being a staunch partisan, she's able to look at situations with a lot of nuance, more so than a lot of people in the D.C. area.\\n\\nMaddie: We align a bit [politically], but my family is a little divided, so I was talking about how growing up in rural Michigan gives me a different perspective.\\n\\nAdam: I would say the overall vibe was more friendly than flirtatious. It's hard on a first date to really give out too strong of a signal without it being weird.\\n\\nMaddie: I got more of a friend vibe from our conversation. There wasn't totally a spark there, [but also] I'm not quick to fall for people. I'm still processing things.\\n\\nAdam: Both of us were surprised by the time we left that we'd been there so long.\\n\\nMaddie: We sat for three hours, and I really didn't think it had been that long. It was 10:30 at that point; I'm normally home by 8 on weeknights. We left and he walked me to the Metro, even though it was out of his way.\\n\\nAdam: I walked her back to the Metro and asked for her phone number.\\n\\nMaddie: I hugged him and then we left. He texted me that night to make sure I got home okay.\\n\\nAdam: I'd personally be interested in a second date. I'm on a quest to go to every Metro station on the map; she seemed interested in that, so maybe it could be an informal, casual way to see if there's something there.\\n\\nMaddie: I could see us being pretty good friends in the future; he's such a nice human, which is kind of rare to find at our age. I don't think we clicked romantically, but I'm not sure — my thoughts aren't very clear on this yet.\\n\\nRate the date\\n\\nAdam: A 4.5 [out of 5]. It was an extremely pleasant evening. I left feeling very happy.\\n\\nMaddie: A solid 3.5. I really, really liked talking to him. It didn't feel like a date totally for me, but it was a great night.\\n\\nUpdate\\n\\nThey've stayed in touch via text; a second date is possible, they say, but so far they haven't set any plans."}
{"original": "1. How does the system work?\\n\\nIt's an opaque process. Vietnam has a collective four pillar leadership structure made up of general secretary, prime minister, president and chair of the National Assembly, the nation's parliament. It governs in consultation with a 17- to 19-member politburo. Nguyen Phu Trong, the current general secretary, also became president in 2018 following the death of President Tran Dai Quang, meaning the top leadership was down to three. Observers anticipate the government will revert to four pillars in 2021.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n2. Who chooses what?\\n\\nThe 13th National Party Congress is scheduled to be held Jan. 25 through Feb. 2. About 1,600 delegates from across the country will vote to select about 200 members to the Central Committee, which in turn will pick the politburo and from that group the party general secretary. The politburo will then nominate candidates for prime minister and the cabinet. These will go to a vote in the National Assembly mid-year.\\n\\n3. Who's in contention for the top job?\\n\\nPrime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, 66, who has won plaudits for guiding the country through the pandemic relatively unscathed, may be in the running for the party chief. His chief rival could be the incumbent's protege, Tran Quoc Vuong, 67, head of the party's central office, who spearheaded Trong's aggressive anti-corruption campaign. Trong, 76, may even pursue another full or partial third term. Possible contenders for other top jobs:\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n• Vuong Dinh Hue, 63, a former minister of finance, deputy prime minister and head of the Party's Central Economic Commission, may be in the running for prime minister.\\n\\n• Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, 61, who holds a master's degree from Tufts University in the U.S. and is also deputy prime minister, is a possible candidate for president.\\n\\n• Truong Thi Mai, 62, a Central Committee member, could be the second woman elected as chair of the National Assembly.\\n\\n4. What challenges await?\\n\\nOn the one hand, boosting growth in the export-dependent nation following a sharp global recession. On the other, doing so without further upsetting the U.S., its biggest export market. The U.S. put Vietnam on notice in October by opening a trade investigation into its currency policy and then imposed preliminary anti-subsidy duties on Vietnamese car and truck tires, citing an undervalued currency. In December, the U.S. Treasury designated the Southeast Asian country a currency manipulator, which comes with no immediate penalties but can escalate trade tensions. Vietnam's authorities will be keen to secure greater access to American consumers while tamping down concerns about the surging trade surplus, on pace in 2020 to break the previous year's record $56 billion.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n5. How has Covid-19 affected the country?\\n\\nAt year-end Vietnam had one of the lowest virus death counts globally, having contained the pathogen. However, economic growth slowed to 2.91% at the end of 2020 as the global downturn brought on by the pandemic sapped demand for made-in-Vietnam products, from smartphones to dress shirts. The government forecasts a 2021 expansion of about 6% compared with 7.02% in 2019.\\n\\n6. What about superpower relations?\\n\\nVietnam depends on China for key materials and equipment to supply its factories. Yet relations with its powerful neighbor -- the two countries fought a brief border war in 1979 -- are fraught and further inflamed because of competing territorial claims in the South China Sea. (Vietnam's coastline of about 3,400 kilometers, or 2,100 miles, follows one of the world's busiest sea cargo lanes.) Vietnam favors greater U.S. economic and military presence in the region to counter China's growing might and is expected to push for a close relationship with the Biden administration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\n7. How are Vietnamese faring?\\n\\nAs decades of market-oriented economic reforms boost incomes and nurture a growing middle class, Vietnam is among the world's most optimistic countries, according to a Nielsen survey. Yet human rights advocates criticize restrictions of basic political and civil freedoms. Arrests and trials of Vietnamese who speak out on issues such as corruption have grown markedly following a new cybersecurity law in 2019, according to Carl Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia. There's typically an up-tick in arrests before the party congress, he said.\\n\\n8. What will a new government mean for investors?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMore of the same. Vietnam's successful handling of the pandemic, improving infrastructure, investor-friendly policies, political stability and its well-educated, young and low-cost workforce is likely to continue attracting international companies. Expect further efforts by the new leadership to sell Vietnam as an increasingly high-tech manufacturing base for suppliers of global giants such as Apple Inc. One concern for companies will be the risk that the trade rift with the U.S. could trigger additional tariffs.\\n\\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com"}
{"original": "It sounds like the Broncos want to have their cake and eat it, too, getting Romo without giving up anything to the Cowboys in return. That may prove impossible, as Dallas is well aware of the highly valuable commodity of which it is in possession, given the NFL's perpetual shortage of quality starting quarterbacks.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHowever, holding on to Romo while waiting for just the perfect moment to deal him to another team that suddenly finds itself with a need at his position, as the Eagles did in trading Sam Bradford to the Vikings just before the regular season started, could prove problematic for the Cowboys. Beginning with offseason training activities in the spring, every day that Romo spends with the team will provide opportunities for reporters to ask him, owner Jerry Jones and everyone else in Dallas how they feel about the awkward situation.\\n\\nRomo, who graciously turned the quarterbacking reins over to rookie Dak Prescott in November, would surely be upset with such a hardball strategy by his longtime team. In addition, Romo is close with Jones, who may feel that, as matter of courtesy and respect, he owes it to the 36-year-old to simply release him and let him choose his own team. Another possibility is that Dallas hangs on to Romo, as a valuable and well-paid insurance policy, but again, Jones risks tension in his locker room.\\n\\nIn 2012, the Colts released Peyton Manning, knowing that they were set to draft Andrew Luck with the No. 1 overall pick. Another factor in that decision was that Indianapolis had salary-cap issues while Manning was set to make a huge amount of money (he was due a $28 million roster bonus), which also made him nearly impossible to trade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOf course, once Manning was released, he eventually landed with the Broncos, which worked out very well for everyone in Denver. Coming off multiple neck surgeries, the decorated quarterback not only rewrote the record book but won a Super Bowl in February 2016.\\n\\nIt's not hard to see a similar dynamic playing with Romo, who recovered this season from a back injury, not the first of his career. The Broncos still have a terrific defense, talent at wide receiver and running back and, just as importantly, a potential need at his position and the ability to absorb a hefty contract.\\n\\nDenver drafted a quarterback, Memphis's Paxton Lynch, in the first round last year, but it gave the bulk of the starts this past season to an unheralded second-year player, Trevor Siemian. The Northwestern product acquitted himself respectably, but he led a struggling offense that was called out by members of the Broncos' defense, and there is little doubt that a healthy Romo would represent an upgrade, at least for a couple of seasons.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nGiven that Siemian and Lynch are both playing on rookie contracts, the Broncos should be able to accommodate Romo's salary, which will be $14 million next year, after which he will have two more seasons left on a six-year, $108 million contract. The website Spotrac lists Denver as having $38,410,833 in 2017 salary-cap space, and teams can usually find ways of freeing up more room when necessary.\\n\\nThe Denver Post's Mark Kiszla recently asked in a column advocating the acquisition of Romo, Can Denver really afford to waste another year of this championship defense with a young quarterback not ready for prime time? Gary Kubiak tried that bluff this year, and it ended with ugly shouting in a locker room divided by the frustration of seven losses."}
{"original": "This Sunday, Feb. 4, will mark the one-year anniversary of the death of student Timothy Piazza. The university continues to mourn his tragic passing. In the immediate aftermath, it became clear wholesale changes were needed to create a sustainable Greek system. We resolved to turn the pain and anguish radiating through our community into decisive reform.\\n\\nOver the past year, the university instituted extensive new measures , which depart significantly from the Greek system's self-governance model. We are making progress:\\n\\nThe university assumed control of the fraternity and sorority organizational misconduct and adjudication process, and established a team of monitors who perform regular spot checks. These compliance checks have surfaced violations of our new safety rules and resulted in several chapters receiving sanctions.\\n\\nOn Dec. 19, the university held a signing ceremony with 70 Greek organization leaders representing 49 chapters and the four governing councils . . . acknowledging the expectations that the university has for its Greek organizations and members.\\n\\nWe instituted our new deferred recruitment policy. Now, new students may not rush a sorority or fraternity until they have completed a full semester. Many sorority students report that waiting to rush this past semester was helpful, because they adjusted to academic and social life on campus, and are now better prepared to consider participation in Greek life.\\n\\nTo help students and their families make more informed decisions about Greek life at Penn State, we instituted a scorecard that reviews the performance of each chapter.\\n\\nUniversity-hired chapter monitors are working with representatives of each fraternity house with respect to their chapter's specific risk-management programs. Risk-management programs must be in place and approved by the university and must include details on how our restrictions on the size of gatherings, our ban on hard liquor and various other required safety protocols will be implemented. The university must approve each plan before any socials involving alcohol are permitted.\\n\\nOur campus police participate in joint nightly patrols with State College Police as part of the Neighborhood Enforcement Alcohol Team at University Park. These patrols have detected safety violations and helped to hold students and chapters accountable for unsafe behavior.\\n\\nOur zero tolerance rule for serious hazing is in place, and will result in the permanent revocation of recognition of any chapter found to have violated the university's requirements.\\n\\nThese measures are making a difference. I am encouraged that we have received letters from our local community about improved chapter behavior in State College. Local law enforcement and others report reduced crowd sizes at fraternity gatherings. Fraternity and sorority leaders are working more closely with the university to implement the new safety programs. This is important progress.\\n\\nUnfortunately, however, significant problems remain. In addition to the permanent Beta Theta Pi ban, a total of 13 other Greek organizations at Penn State have received multiyear suspensions for safety violations. While these consequences demonstrate that we mean business, the large number of suspended chapters also shows that many students have ignored the call for behavior change and fallen short of our values and expectations.\\n\\nOne of the underlying tenets of belonging to a community is the shared responsibility for the safety and well-being of its members.\\n\\nTo that end, as we approach the one-year anniversary of a terrible tragedy we must do more:\\n\\nAll of our students, as adults, must recognize the importance of safety and make changes in your own lives that will create a safer community.\\n\\nOur Greek-letter community needs to embrace the need for change and rededicate yourselves to a mission of service and community. We must do better.\\n\\nNational Greek organizations absolutely must assume leadership responsibility. Three chapters that lost university recognition, Alpha Chi Rho, Alpha Sigma Phi and Sigma Alpha Mu, did not receive chapter suspensions from their national offices. That is unacceptable.\\n\\nParents and Greek alumni should provide a much higher level of support to their chapters and provide guidance and mentoring. Sadly, we found in our monitoring that parents of students in some chapters helped students violate the law and university rules against alcohol consumption.\\n\\nWe must set a national example for reform. To that end, on April 23 and 24, I look forward to gathering university presidents, provosts and student affairs leaders from across the country to begin to explore ideas for cooperative action.\\n\\nWe also continue to work with Pennsylvania and federal legislators toward stricter hazing penalties. In short, we will not rest in our efforts, with the hope that this kind of tragedy never occurs again.\\n\\nThank you for your attention, and for your commitment to these efforts. Much remains to be done, and the memory of Timothy Piazza deserves nothing less than our collective action."}
{"original": "The economic challenges posed by the virus are unique in that they are already hitting supply and demand. The former refers to the inability of workers to go to work, because of quarantines either at their jobs or their kids' schools, along with disruptions to the global flow of goods to retailers and factories. The latter refers to reduced spending at restaurants, movie theaters, stores, etc. Consider, for example, the many trips, vacations and conferences already being canceled. Add to that the chance that millions of workers without paid leave could lose paychecks, and you begin to get a sense of the sudden shock to commerce.\\n\\nThe combined effect of decreased demand and disrupted supply can lead to a serious recession. While we can hope the effects of the epidemic will be short-lived and the economy will quickly bounce back, we cannot take this for granted. Therefore, policymakers must move quickly to prepare effective economic countermeasures.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAmong our most prominent concerns are the millions of employees who may be told not to come to work but who lack paid leave. While more than 70 percent of private-sector workers have some degree of paid sick leave, for workers in the bottom 25 percent of the wage scale, that share falls to 47 percent. Based on their low, often nonexistent, savings, such workers have little to fall back on if they're not getting paid.\\n\\nThere are various ways to quickly provide the support these households need.\\n\\nUnemployment insurance is often the first line of defense in a downturn, and we should be sure that state systems are ready to respond quickly. Two important considerations: Some big state trust funds (New York, California and Texas) are running low, and state agencies need to know that employees who are available for work but locked out because of a quarantine are eligible for unemployment insurance.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne fast way to administer help is for the government to send checks to low- and middle-income households, a measure that was last used in 2008, when the George W. Bush administration sent out about $100 billion in 2008 to about 70 million households, which got an average check of about $1,100 in today's dollars. Research found these checks to be particularly useful to low-income households.\\n\\nThis intervention must be structured to reach low-income households without federal income-tax liabilities. (To be clear, these households do pay other federal taxes, most notably payroll taxes.) This is a huge limitation of the federal tax cuts under consideration by the Trump administration.\\n\\nSomething we really don't want is for sick workers who don't have paid leave to go to work, a known problem well before the coronavirus. Providing a generous tax break to employers (e.g. $800 per worker) to grant at least seven sick days a year to workers not covered would be a substantial incentive. In the same vein, we may also want to encourage employers to allow telecommuting, where possible. A modest credit for allowing telecommuting (e.g. $400) could increase the use of this option. An advantage of both these credits is that any changes are likely to be permanent.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt various times in the recent past, we've quickly put more money into workers' paychecks by temporarily lowering their FICA (payroll) tax. This, too, requires legislation, a key part of which is to ensure that the Social Security Trust Fund is repaid through general revenue, as occurred the last time we tapped this source of quick relief.\\n\\nAll of the above are countercyclical fiscal measures: government spending to offset the shock. Monetary policy is also germane in this context, and the Federal Reserve has already signaled a willingness to cut the benchmark interest rate it controls to cheapen credit. There is, however, a good chance that rate cuts will be of limited help. First, credit is already cheap. But more important, if people are afraid of getting sick in public places, they won't take trips or go out to eat no matter how low interest rates fall. Nor will rate cuts reopen workplaces, factories and schools that are closed because of the virus.\\n\\nTurning to other ways in which the virus threatens family incomes, we need to be sure that people don't avoid testing and treatment because of insurance and surprise billing concerns. The Affordable Care Act covers government-recommended vaccines, but that option is many months away. The broader public interest makes this a critical moment for the government to pick up the tab for coronavirus-related treatment. Congress should act quickly to require that insurers cover testing and treatment for the coronavirus in the same way they are required to cover various forms of preventive care at no charge to patients.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe can also improve on the process of developing a vaccine. As Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar testified recently, we don't know whether a vaccine will be affordable because the holder of the patent will be able to charge whatever it wants.\\n\\nThis is unacceptable. It's fine and necessary for the government to provide resources to private companies to speed up development and testing of the vaccine, but there need to be two conditions. First, all the findings have to be made public as quickly as is practical. We want researchers worldwide to be able to benefit from any new findings to get to an effective vaccine as quickly as possible. The model here is the Bermuda Principles for the Human Genome Project, where results were posted nightly.\\n\\nSecond, any patents resulting from this work will be in the public domain. This means a successful vaccine will be available as a cheap generic from day one. The companies don't need to be compensated for their research because they've already been paid."}

Wednesday's events went beyond that, into disconcerting territory: far-right attacks on democracy made literal. Chilling footage from the scene circulated globally, of lawmakers fleeing, Capitol Police with their guns drawn inside the Capitol building and a mob of angry Trump supporters running loose in the halls. One photo showed a man sitting in the chair of a member of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) staff, his feet on the desk.

The disdain for democratic institutions is devastating.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome foreign outlets, including the BBC and the Australian newspaper the Sydney Morning Herald, maintained live coverage of Wednesday's developments in Washington.\\n\\nMany eyes were already turned on the United States, as foreign observers tracked the closely contested runoff Senate race in Georgia.

{"original": "With that in mind, an intriguing possibility emerged: What if the ultimate goal of that trade was to pry Jimmy Garoppolo away from the Patriots?\\n\\nAmong others proposing that scenario was Mary Kay Cabot, a longtime Browns beat writer. The Browns have the ammunition to acquire Jimmy Garoppolo and will try to put together a strong package that the Patriots will accept, she wrote at cleveland.com.\\n\\nAs Cabot noted on Twitter, one apparent side effect of the trade is that it presumably paves the way for Tony Romo to possibly join the Texans. Having lured Osweiler away from the Broncos last year with a four-year, $72 million contract, Houston watched him implode in his first year of being a full-time starter. Osweiler eventually lost his job to unheralded backup Tom Savage, and the Texans are happy to get that hefty contract off their books even if they don't land Romo.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe Browns signaled that they don't have much use for Osweiler, either, with football operations chief Sashi Brown starting off his official statement on the deal with, We're really excited to acquire a second-round draft choice in this trade.\\n\\nDraft picks are extremely important to our approach in building a championship caliber football team, Brown added. We are intent on adding competition to every position on our roster and look forward to having Brock come in and compete.\\n\\nIt Cleveland doesn't turn around and trade Osweiler to another team, which is not out of the question, it will essentially have paid $16 million — Osweiler's cost this year before he can be cut with no further obligation — for a second-round pick. That may seem like a steep price, although the nature of this deal, akin to what NBA teams have done but essentially unprecedented in the NFL, makes it a difficult judgment to render with any certainty. In any event, if it helps land the highly regarded Garoppolo, the cost could well have been worth it, especially considering that the Browns entered this offseason with over $100 million salary-cap space.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA second-round pick in 2014, Garoppolo rarely got off the bench in his first two seasons, but he shone in two starts this season when Tom Brady was serving his Deflategate suspension. The 25-year-old completed 68.3 of his passes for 502 yards, four touchdowns, zero interceptions and a 113.3 rating, showing impressive decision-making and pocket presence.\\n\\nWith the 39-year-old Brady's play showing no signs of deterioration en route to a championship season, the Patriots have the luxury of dangling Garoppolo for a king's ransom or simply keeping him for one more season as an excellent insurance policy against a possible Brady injury. New England recently signaled it was more than willing to take the latter approach, but that could be a negotiating stance.\\n\\nCabot and others had already reported that the Browns were interested in trading for Garoppolo, and it's entirely possible that the Patriots have been playing hardball with them behind the scenes. Cleveland holds the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft, but understandably wants to keep it. The Browns also have the No. 12 pick, which could be in play but possibly not enough to get a deal done.\\n\\nNow the Browns have another high-value pick to offer, even after amassing a war chest that includes two second-rounders this year and 11 selections altogether. They also have extra picks in 2018's fourth and sixth rounds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf there's an NFL team known for a strategy of stocking up on draft picks, it's the Patriots, who have often traded back from their first-round positions, sometimes to the dismay of their fans (although they obviously can't complain much about the results). Could this year's No. 12 pick, plus a second-rounder, get them to give up Garoppolo? How about three second-round picks? We may find out, but the team can hardly expect to see a stronger offers than those for an essentially still-unproven player."}
{"original": "Intel Drops Plans for ID Numbers By Robert O'Harrow Jr. and Elizabeth Corcoran\\n\\nWashington Post Staff Writers\\n\\nTuesday, January 26, 1999; Page E1 Intel Corp. yesterday abruptly backed away from plans for its new silicon chips to automatically issue a unique identification number on the Internet, after critics complained that the technology could expose computer users to privacy intrusions. The turnabout by the giant computer chip maker followed an announcement by privacy advocates earlier in the day that they would urge consumers to boycott Intel products in protest of the chip's ID component. This is a significant victory for privacy, said Barry Steinhardt, associate director for the American Civil Liberties Union, who praised Intel for responding to the criticism so quickly. They did it on Internet time. In announcing the ID feature of the new Pentium III microprocessor last week, Intel officials described it as an important step for Internet security. The ID number would help verify the identity of people doing business online, company officials said. While each chip still will have a unique number, Intel officials said yesterday, software will be configured in such a way that consumers will be required to turn the ID function on instead of turning it off, as the company had planned. Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for the Santa Clara, Calif., company, acknowledged that Intel is reversing course to show consumers it is sensitive to acute concerns about privacy aired last week after the chip's design was announced. We're listening to what the marketplace is telling us, that they would prefer to turn it on as opposed to turning it off, Mulloy said. You must account for privacy if you're going to have security. But some privacy advocates believe the change does not go far enough. Computer makers will not be able to include the software for turning the identification number off and on when they sell their first batches of the new machines, which are due to hit the market in coming months. Instead, users must electronically fetch the program from Intel's Web site. In addition, the utility program is available only for Windows software. -Those who use the Linux operating system, for instance, must wait until those developers write a similar program. Privacy advocates also worry that computer users will be coerced into handing over their identification numbers to get into certain sites on the World Wide Web – in essence, allowing businesses at those Web sites to track precisely what computer users do and to compare that activity with data collected about the individual at other Web sites. The default for privacy should be no ID number, said David Banisar, policy director for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a advocacy group in Washington that helped organize the Intel boycott. Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), ranking member of the Commerce subcommittee on telecommunications, trade and consumer protection, said he believes consumers need better privacy protections online. I have great concerns about any unique identifier Web sites might use without any rules, said Markey, who wrote a letter to Intel complaining about the chip last week. © Copyright The Washington Post Company Back to the top"}
{"original": "AD\\n\\nPlenty of that is going to happen behind the scenes, but we already know what many of the campaign benchmarks will be this year. The political calendar is slowly filling in, and the window for candidates to announce is fairly narrow; no one who went on to win his or her party's nomination in this century announced (or formed an exploratory committee) any later than April the year before the election.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJan. 18-21: The AFL-CIO will hold its Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Civil and Human Rights Conference, which is open to 2020 contenders; there's little buzz about this so far, but it has the potential to be the Democrats' first cattle call, and the AFL-CIO has the clout to call Democrats in whenever it wants.\\n\\nJan. 19: The third Women's March will take place around the country, with special plans for Washington, where organizers are putting together a lobbying day focused on getting a House vote on Medicare-for-all and where they'll release a Women's Agenda, This will be the first of these marches since a battery of controversies for the umbrella Women's March organization, especially of the association between one organizer and Louis Farrakhan. But most Democrats with presidential ambitions have spoken at previous marches and are expected to again.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJan. 31-Feb. 3: The Republican National Committee meets in Washington, where it will continue to clarify its 2020 primary rules, amid serious discussion of altering them to make any challenge to President Trump impossible.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFeb. 13-16: The Democratic National Committee meets, also in Washington, and will make one of the final big decisions before the primary: the site of the 2020 convention. In the past, this meeting has also drawn in a few presidential contenders, though changes to primary rules have diminished the delegate voting power of DNC members.\\n\\nFeb. 22: New Hampshire's McIntyre-Shaheen Dinner will unfold in Manchester. It's likely to be the first cattle call in an early voting state, coming after a number of first-tier candidates have entered the race.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFeb. 27-March 2: The annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, will be held again in suburban Washington. Trump has appeared there every year since entering the 2016 Republican primary, and the local reception for him has evolved from contempt (2016) to jubilation (2017) to outright adoration (2018).\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarch 10-13: The annual International Association of Fire Fighters conference comes to D.C., and the first day typically takes place in a ballroom near the Capitol, with prominent politicians invited to speak on any topic to members. The union's longtime president Harold Schaitberger has already all but pledged to back Joe Biden if he enters the race.\\n\\nMarch 24-26: One of the largest annual political events in the country, the AIPAC Policy Conference, will be held in downtown Washington. Traditionally, the off-year sessions don't give many speaking slots to presidential candidates; that's reserved for election years. But the event, anchored by a lengthy speech from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is built to showcase the clout of pro-Israel lobbyists, and worries about declining support for Israel among Democratic voters have become a topic there.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMarch 31: It's the end of the first fundraising quarter, the first traditional gut check and re-sorting of any presidential field. In the 2008 cycle, this was the moment when Barack Obama nearly matched Hillary Clinton's money haul, firming up the idea that he was a credible challenger. Note that Obama announced his numbers in the first week of April; campaigns are not required to turn everything in to the Federal Election Commission until April 15, but increasingly, campaigns like to get a jump on the official filing and calculate their totals for the press.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLate April: One of the last Fridays in this month is devoted to House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry, an annual event that stands out for Democrats for a simple reason: It's the biggest political gathering for African American voters in an early primary state.\\n\\nMay 21: Statewide primaries will take place in Kentucky, one of three states that will elect a governor this year. In 2015, eventual Democratic nominee Jack Conway spent the whole campaign evading questions about who he'd back for president, saying he would support Joe Biden, who was not running. Why should a candidate for governor answer that question? It's fair to ask, but tying the Democratic candidate to his national party has become a go-to tactic for Republicans here. Any Democrat who wants to prove his or her strength outside of blue America will be paying attention.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMay 31-June 2: The California Democratic Party Convention is happening in San Francisco this year, and, for the first time since 2008, the state has secured an early slot on the primary calendar. That's likely to turn this into a showcase for multiple Democrats, in a forum where a good speech, in front of a massive audience, can get national attention. It was here in 2003 that Howard Dean pronounced himself a member of the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party and assailed Democrats who'd backed the Iraq War.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJune: The first official Democratic presidential primary debate will take place, location to be determined. The DNC has sanctioned six debates in 2019, all of them to be held outside the first four primary states. That means, in practice, that the candidates who make it onstage will burn 12 to 18 days this year on prep, travel and the debates themselves.\\n\\nMid-June: Mitt Romney's annual donor summit is expected to celebrate its fifth year in Park City, Utah, — the first, obviously, with the host representing the state as a senator. There will be several moments when Republicans ask (or the press prods them to ask) if the party can go into 2020 with Trump still leading it; this will be the most scenic of those moments.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJune 30: The end of the second fundraising quarter, which can be a winnowing moment for candidates who have not yet shown any ability to stack money.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nJuly. The NAACP Convention will take place in Detroit; typically, the event includes a candidate forum where presidential contenders get equal time to speak and are encouraged to discuss civil rights.\\n\\nJuly 11-13: The 14th Netroots Nation conference will take place in Philadelphia; for the third time, it will feature some sort of forum for Democratic presidential candidates. In 2007, that took the form of a debate, which made some news when Hillary Clinton got into an argument about lobbyists (they represent real Americans). In 2015 it became a series of Q&As with the candidates who had bothered to show up; both Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders were interrupted by Black Lives Matter activists. This year, organizers say the format is to be determined.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAug. 8-18: It's the most cliche-rich event in politics: the Iowa State Fair. It's also a focusing event for candidates, who are given time at a Des Moines Register-sponsored soapbox to deliver their stump speech.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSept. 2: Multiple primary states will be holding Labor Day events; the AFL-CIO's breakfast in New Hampshire has frequently become a go-to event for Democrats that day. (Sanders has attended it every year since 2016.)\\n\\nMid-September: The New Hampshire Democratic Party holds its convention in Manchester, giving candidates the biggest captive audience they'll have in that state until the new year.\\n\\nSept. 28: Since 2017, the last Saturday of the month has been given over to the Polk County Democratic Party Steak Fry, a successor to the Iowa candidate cattle call that former senator Tom Harkin held for years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSept. 30: This is the end of the third fundraising quarter, and by this point in previous cycles, candidates who've struggled have seen their futures and dropped out. In 2011 and 2015, the first two Republican primaries in the era of the super PAC, several candidates plowed forward despite raising nearly nothing for their own campaigns. The toxicity of big money PACs in Democratic politics is likely to alter that trend.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOctober: Iowa Democrats will hold their Fall Dinner, formerly known as the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner. This was the event that turned Obama into the Iowa front-runner, after months of slogging through and underperforming at candidate forums.\\n\\nDec. 31: Every New Year's Eve before the Iowa caucuses marks the end of the fourth fundraising quarter; by Jan. 15, just a few weeks before voting, every candidate will have revealed his and her totals for the year. Then, and only then, will we know who endured the marathon, who ran out of money, and who kept raising money after being completely written off. And we're just 363 days away.\\n\\nON THE TRAIL\\n\\nWarren's Iowa adventure. Since the Massachusetts senator's last visit to Iowa, in 2014, a few parts of the state have grown a bit bluer. There's a lot more of Iowa that's gotten redder — and that's where Warren will be going.\\n\\nThree of Warren's five scheduled stops this weekend will take her to the 4th Congressional District, represented by Republican Steve King. Pottawattamie County backed Trump by 21 points, Woodbury County by 20 points, Buena Vista County by 24 points. And all went by double digits for Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) in last year's statewide elections. Just 10 years ago, Barack Obama had lost them by only a few points.\\n\\nThat itinerary has turned some heads in Iowa. I'm excited that with so many people focused on Des Moines and urban areas, that she's coming out here, said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who narrowly lost to King last year. She's going to hear about health care. She's going to talk to people who are worried about market consolidation and how farmers are being squeezed, both on the input side and the output side.\\n\\nScholten, who ran 14 points ahead of Hillary Clinton in the district, had campaigned with a number of lesser-known Democrats with presidential ambitions. Warren, he said, had sent three fundraising letters on behalf of his campaign; when he was at the 2018 Netroots Nation conference in New Orleans, Warren made time for a meeting with him.\\n\\nMost of Warren's events are being promoted as organizing gatherings, as opposed to policy listening tour stops of the sort Clinton made in 2015. One is a roundtable in Storm Lake, a city in Buena Vista County, but Iowa Democrats point out that there's a unique local story there.\\n\\nI'm proud of her for choosing Storm Lake, said Sean Bagniewski, the chair of the Polk County Democratic Party. It's one of the few Iowa cities that's growing, and it's because it's been very welcoming to immigrants. It's known as a melting pot in rural Iowa; I'd love to see more Democrats heading there.\\n\\nBut after a year of lower-profile candidates heading to Iowa, the stakes for Warren are high. This is the first 2020 event at which crowdsmanship, the practice of scanning turnout for a candidate to see if they have the juice, will be in effect. Warren's first event on Saturday is at one of Sioux City's largest arts venues, one that Clinton rallied in ahead of the 2016 caucuses. Turnout of less than 2,000 would leave the venue looking somewhat empty — something pointed out to us by an operative for another Democrat who may run for president.\\n\\nDEMS IN DISARRAY\\n\\nNancy Pelosi is once again the speaker of the House, returning to the job after eight years despite 15 members of her party not voting for her. What matters for 2020 is that 20 Democrats in districts carried by the president backed the new speaker; Republicans, who need to win at least 19 seats to flip the House, immediately painted targets on them.\\n\\nWith the very first chance they got, they broke their word and their bond with the voters who elected them, said Dan Conston, the new president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, in a statement from the Republican super PAC. CLF will make sure voters know that their member of Congress already broke their word, all to support an out-of-touch San Francisco liberal who is desperate to hold on to power.\\n\\nThere's actually a spirited disagreement among Republicans about whether this attack works; Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the new chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, has worried that the obsessive focus on Pelosi in 2018 did little to boost Republicans outside of very safe districts.\\n\\nAnd the 20 Pelosi-backing Trump district Democrats really fit into two camps. One camp come from places where Trump performed more weakly than previous Republican nominees: Reps. Tom O'Halleran (Ariz.), Lucy McBath (Ga.), Lauren Underwood (Ill.), Haley Stevens (Mich.), Angie Craig (Minn.), Josh Gottheimer (Mass.) and Kendra Horn (Okla.).\\n\\nThe remaining 13 Democrats come from a range of districts, from the most Trump-friendly place represented by a Democrat (Minnesota's 7th) to Nevada's 3rd District, where Trump actually won a smaller share of the vote than Mitt Romney; third-party voters were responsible for his win margin.\\n\\nThe point: If Republicans knocked off every Democrat from a red-tinted district who voted for Pelosi today, and reelected every one of their incumbents, they'd come out of 2020 with a majority. But the map isn't that simple.\\n\\nStill, Republicans ended their first day of divided government by promising to hold pro-Pelosi Democrats accountable. America Rising blasted out a list of 21 Democrats who went back on their word to back Pelosi that included 11 from increasingly blue districts carried by Clinton. The House GOP's own rapid-response team called out 11 Democrats, nine of whom won in safe blue seats.\\n\\nAlso worth noting: While a few Democrats pledged specifically not to back Pelosi, many more found routes around the Pelosi question, saying that they wanted to see new leadership, or see who was seeking the gavel — and then, after the election, saying that Pelosi had won them over.\\n\\n2020\\n\\nBernie Sanders. The New York Times published the most comprehensive investigation so far of allegations of sexual harassment against staffers in the senator's 2016 campaign, an issue that had been bubbling under the surface for months. Sanders, who dislikes discussing scandal or campaign details more than most politicians, appeared on CNN on Wednesday and said that he supported changes in harassment reporting policy; then, he added that he was a little busy on the trail and thus unaware of the details as harassment was reported.\\n\\nTom Steyer. The next three stops on his five rights tour are Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada; he announced as much last month but clarified this week that the Iowa stop will be in Des Moines.\\n\\nAmy Klobuchar. She told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that she will decide soon on a 2020 bid.\\n\\nTerry McAuliffe. He published an op-ed in The Post today, urging Democrats to run on realistic solutions in 2020 — one way of saying they risked swinging too far to the left.\\n\\nElizabeth Warren. She sat down with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday night, making news when she criticized the foreign policy establishment that had criticized the president's decision to withdraw troops from Syria and Afghanistan, though she said that the president's process for doing so was too slapdash.\\n\\nWHAT I'M WATCHING\\n\\nMedicare-for-all. It's official: The new Democratic House will hold hearings on single-payer health care, for the first time in decades — the first time, ever, that the current version of Medicare-for-all will go through the committee process.\\n\\nThat does not mean that the dream of the modern left will become law this year. But advocates know that. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the sponsor of the House legislation, said having public hearings and traditional scoring for the bill will elevate it as a 2020 issue.\\n\\nIt will ensure that this will be part of the 2020 presidential platforms, said Jayapal. We will be looking at every single candidate from this lens.\\n\\nWithin hours of Jayapal's announcement, potential 2020 candidates were celebrating. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), arriving at a party held for supporters Wednesday, told them that the House would be doing what cynics called impossible just years earlier.\\n\\nI want to congratulate the House for holding hearings for the first time on Medicare-for-all, he told The Post. I'm confident the results will show that Medicare-for-all is the way forward if we want to guarantee health care to all people in a cost-effective way.\\n\\nLeft-wing activists will step up their advocacy for Medicare-for-all in the coming days, with rallies for the policy around the Jan. 19 Women's March. MoveOn is also about to distribute a memo, written by Data for Progress, that crunched data from the 2018 election to argue that Democrats running on the policy were not effectively attacked for it by Republicans.\\n\\nNeither polling data nor actual election results suggest that embracing Medicare for All or the broader progressive agenda hurt Democratic politicians in 2018, Data for Progress concludes in the memo.\\n\\nWAIT, WHAT?\\n\\nFor the first time in decades, the House of Representatives opened a new session with one vacant seat — the 9th District of North Carolina. Mark Harris, the Republican who declared victory in that race in November, spent Thursday filing a motion in Wake County Superior Court, asking to be certified as a member of Congress.\\n\\nThe voters of the Ninth Congressional District are entitled to have their elected representative in place by the time Congress convenes, Harris's attorneys wrote in their brief for the court.\\n\\nUnfortunately for Harris, that's not how this works. Democrats, whose majority gives them the power to seat or refuse to seat new members, have been adamant: There will be no member from this district until there is a judgment on allegations that Harris paid a Republican operative to discard ballots that could have swung the election.\\n\\nWhat could happen next? North Carolina Republicans, who now say that Harris should be seated, are sticking with him and filing lawsuits on his behalf, attempting to move the matter to federal court. But if they lose there, a law passed by the Republican-run legislature would mandate any vacancy to be filled in a special election, preceded by a primary. One potential timeline: Both parties pick their nominees in a late spring primary, then elect a new congressman as late as November.\\n\\nThis would not be the longest vacancy in recent congressional history; a full year passed between the December 2017 resignation of Michigan's John Conyers and the seating of a Democrat who won the special November 2018 election to replace him. But it could mean that for most of the next year, Republicans have just 199 votes in the House, making it incrementally easier for Democrats to pass bills.\\n\\nREADING LIST\\n\\nWhy the New Democratic Majority Could Work Better Than the Last, by Ronald Brownstein\\n\\nThis point really can't be made enough: For the first time, Democrats have a majority in the House of Representatives that does not include a conservative bloc from the South. The median member of the conference is now a center-left suburbanite.\\n\\nThe piece itself is funny, but it also gets at something that greatly aided Warren this week: As the first credible female candidate in the Democratic race, she endured the first attempts to brand a female candidate as unlikable, and that rallied even some Democrats who don't plan to support her.\\n\\nYou may already be running, by Alexandra Petri\\n\\nJust read it.\\n\\nCOUNTDOWN"}
{"original": "But unlike the 2016 presidential campaign when Russians worked to help elect Donald Trump, the people behind the Alabama effort — dubbed Project Birmingham — were Americans. Now Democratic operatives and a research firm known to have had roles in Project Birmingham are distancing themselves from its most controversial tactics.\\n\\nJones's narrow, upset victory over Republican Roy Moore in all likelihood resulted from other factors, political analysts say. Moore spent much of the special-election campaign battling reports in The Post that he had decades earlier made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nRecent revelations about Project Birmingham, however, have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign.\\n\\nAs the scandal has expanded, with calls for federal and state investigations and Facebook also conducting a review, the tactics described in the Project Birmingham document have come under intense scrutiny. Those included a false flag effort that generated phony evidence that automated Russian accounts called bots had supported Moore on Twitter and the creation of a misleading Facebook page, aimed at Alabama conservatives, that sought to undermine Moore by encouraging them to vote for a rival Republican through a write-in campaign.\\n\\nBut all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in the document.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nProject Birmingham got its funding from Internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.\\n\\nHoffman gave $750,000 to a progressive technology start-up called American Engagement Technologies — founded by Mikey Dickerson, a former Obama administration official — that aimed to help Democrats, according to a person familiar with the finances who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This person said Dickerson used $100,000 of that to hire New Knowledge, a Texas-based social media research firm, to work in Alabama in support of Jones during the special election in December 2017.\\n\\nDickerson — who is best known for leading the effort to fix HealthCare.gov, the glitchy portal for President Barack Obama's signature health-care initiative — said in a statement to The Post that he learned of the extent of Project Birmingham only months after it was complete, when he received a report on the operation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI received the report in early 2018, which is when I first learned about the false flag and write-in tactics, Dickerson said in his statement, his first public comment on the controversy.\\n\\nThat report, he said, came from New Knowledge, a company known mainly for its efforts to investigate online disinformation. More recently, it co-authored a report last month on Russian disinformation for the Senate Intelligence Committee.\\n\\nJonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, has denied knowledge of most of the activities described in the Project Birmingham document and disputed Dickerson's claim that New Knowledge authored it.\\n\\n'Influence the outcome'\\n\\nWhat is known about Project Birmingham comes mainly from the 12-page document labeled Project Birmingham Debrief, which was obtained by The Post. It is dated Dec. 15, 2017, three days after the Alabama vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe document describes the effort as a digital messaging operation to influence the outcome of the AL senate race by targeting 650,000 likely voters with messages on social media platforms such as Facebook, while obscuring the fact that the messages were coming from an effort backing Jones. Jones has said he had no knowledge of Project Birmingham and has called for a federal investigation.\\n\\nThe goal of the effort was to radicalize Democrats, suppress unpersuadable Republicans (hard Rs) and faction moderate Republicans by advocating for write-in candidates, the document states.\\n\\nThe document also makes bold but unverified claims about the effects of the operation, saying that it provided the decisive margin in an election decided by fewer than 22,000 voters — moving enough votes to ensure a Doug Jones victory.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPolitical analysts expressed skepticism that any of these tactics affected the election.\\n\\nMy initial gut says that the alleged disinformation campaign I've read about would not have been enough to affect this race. Roy Moore is so well known in Alabama that people had very settled opinions about whether they wanted them as their senator before the race even started, said University of Alabama political scientist Joseph L. Smith.\\n\\nLast September, Dickerson presented what he said was a truncated version of the Project Birmingham debrief at a meeting of technology experts — several of them alumni of the Obama administration — in downtown Washington. The 13 attendees of that meeting were required to sign nondisclosure agreements.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIn the version of the document distributed at the meeting, a black rectangle obscured part of a sentence that would have made clear the name of the entity that conducted Project Birmingham. After weeks of declining to comment, Dickerson told The Post that the redaction was NK — for New Knowledge.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPrior to presenting the report in September, I edited New Knowledge's report for length and to redact identifying information, Dickerson wrote in his statement to The Post. This was the only firsthand account of this kind of operation that I knew of, so I presented it to the group to analyze and discuss.\\n\\nDickerson declined to answer numerous other questions about the campaign, including what he knew of Hoffman's role.\\n\\nSome 'experiments'\\n\\nBefore Dickerson had sent his statement to The Post, Morgan, the New Knowledge chief, had publicly denied writing the Project Birmingham report or knowing about most of what it describes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMorgan, in comments to The Post and in a blog post on the self-publishing site Medium, acknowledged conducting some experiments with disinformation tactics during the Alabama election. Those included creating a Facebook page called Alabama Conservative Politics that shared news links with its followers. He also said that New Knowledge spent about $30,000 on targeted Facebook advertising during the Alabama election season and that he bought some retweets to test his ability to lift social media messages.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMorgan characterized the work as a small, limited research project on Facebook while speculating that Project Birmingham as described in the debrief document was a combination of his efforts and those that might have been conducted by others. He described the Project Birmingham document as AET's report — suggesting it had been a product of Dickerson's start-up, American Engagement Technologies, also known as AET.\\n\\nI acknowledge working with AET, but I don't recognize the claims they're making now, Morgan said on Medium. We did not write the leaked report and we could not have because it didn't reflect our research. The leaked version of the report made a number of claims that did not originate with us.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHoffman also has denied knowing about the operation in Alabama, though he has acknowledged providing the money to AET and apologized for his role in how it was eventually used.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI find the tactics that have been recently reported highly disturbing, Hoffman said in a statement. For that reason, I am embarrassed by my failure to track AET — the organization I did support — more diligently as it made its own decisions to perhaps fund projects that I would reject.\\n\\nHoffman's financial relationship with AET was brokered by his political adviser, Dmitri Mehlhorn, who heads a group called Investing in US that helps direct Silicon Valley money into left-leaning political causes.\\n\\nMehlhorn said he too was unaware of key details about Project Birmingham, but he defended the idea of learning from the Russian disinformation operatives at the Internet Research Agency, who backed Trump in the 2016 election and in his first year in the White House, according to U.S. officials.\\n\\nThe Internet Research Agency engaged in many, many tactics, some of which I think it is appropriate for us to mirror and some of which I think we should disavow. The tactics they engaged in [that] we need to disavow [include] misinformation and promoting racial hatred, Mehlhorn said. The tactics we need to mirror are really good social microtargeting.\\n\\nAnger after losing in 2016\\n\\nProject Birmingham had its roots in the anger and frustration Democrats felt after losing the White House and Congress in 2016 — with the assistance, many were convinced, of online disinformation peddled by Russians and also U.S. conservatives active on social media, who pushed damaging but false information about Democrat Hillary Clinton's health, honesty and suitability for office.\\n\\nOne person who expressed a desire to fight back was Dickerson, according to social media researcher Renee DiResta, who met him at a conference in Chicago in the same month that Trump was inaugurated. Dickerson told her at the time about his desire to create a start-up to battle political disinformation, she said.\\n\\nThere was a feeling after the Trump election that Democrats hadn't prioritized tech, that Republicans had built this amazing juggernaut machine, said DiResta. The right wing was running a meme war, and there were these crazy dirty tricks. People wanted to build countermeasures.\\n\\nDiResta briefly advised AET, offering technical guidance and helping them meet potential supporters in the months before Hoffman agreed to fund the company.\\n\\nDiResta, who also accepted a single share in AET and a seat on its board, said she became concerned with the opaqueness of the project, and severed ties with the company a few months after joining. She became research director at New Knowledge in January 2018 but said that, while she had heard of an experiment in Alabama, she did not know about the tactics.\\n\\n'The shifting of votes'\\n\\nWhile debate continues over who did what in Project Birmingham, The Post was able to find some evidence for several of the claims in the explanatory document.\\n\\nThe document, for example, says it planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet. We then tied that botnet to the Moore campaign digital director, making it appear as if he had purchased the accounts. Morgan denied any knowledge of the incident involving Russian bots.\\n\\nDuring the campaign, journalists wrote stories about Twitter accounts that appeared to be Russian followers of Moore.\\n\\nThose accounts were later suspended by Twitter. The Post found an archived version of a misleading tweet and also several news reports and tweets by journalists during the Alabama election describing evidence that Russian bots were supporting Moore. The Project Birmingham document cited an article in the New York Post with the headline Roy Moore flooded with fake Russian Twitter followers.\\n\\nOther journalists, however, expressed skepticism at the time, noting that the supposed Russian bots made obvious mistakes, leaving profile information in some tweets in Cyrillic, the Russian-language alphabet.\\n\\nEvidence also supports the document's claims about creating a conservative Facebook page to siphon support away from Moore. In a section headed Splitting Republican votes, the document says that a Facebook page created by Project Birmingham had contact with a Republican write-in candidate beginning on Nov. 18, 2017, and later endorsed this candidate, who was not named.\\n\\nThe description and timing fits the experience of Mac Watson, the owner of a patio supply store who ran a Republican write-in campaign and said he had communications with a Facebook page beginning on that date.\\n\\nThe document also describes Project Birmingham helping the unnamed write-in candidate gain new Twitter followers — something Watson recalls as well, with 10,000 suddenly appearing on his account. He also gained some exposure with the help of the operator of the Facebook page, which the document claims acted as a media advisor helping to arrange interviews with news organizations. The document included an image of a Dec. 5 Washington Post story on Watson. The author of that piece, David Weigel, said he does not recall anyone arranging interviews for his story."}
{"original": "It slammed Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel, saying he was partly to blame because he had changed active shooter policy to say that deputies may enter a building to engage a shooter, indicating it wasn't necessary. Israel has changed the policy again. The report also noted that some sheriff's deputies said they could not remember the last time they underwent training for an active shooter.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd the report was critical of the school security program operated by Broward County Public Schools. The report said it failed to stop the alleged shooter, Nikolas Cruz, a former student with a history of disciplinary problems and mental health concerns, from entering the school Feb. 14 with a semiautomatic rifle and killing 14 students and three staff members. Neither the school nor the district had a clear plan to lock down classrooms. It took several minutes for that to happen, leaving students, teachers and staff members vulnerable to being shot, it said.\\n\\nThe report starts with this warning:\\n\\nSchool safety in Florida needs to be improved. We can do more and we can do a better job of ensuring the safety of students and staff on K-12 school campuses. Not all school security changes or enhancements have financial costs, and some only require the will of decision-makers to effect change and hold people responsible for implementing best practices. Safety and security accountability is lacking in schools, and that accountability is paramount for effective change if we expect a different result in the future than what occurred at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSDHS) on February 14, 2018.\\n\\nThe 15-member commission included sheriffs from several Florida counties, including Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who served as chairman. The fathers of three students killed during the rampage were also appointed. The report will be sent to the Florida legislature and governor. The panel interviewed hundreds of witnesses and reviewed a massive amount of evidence, it said.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPerhaps the most controversial recommendation among dozens made by the commission called for training and giving weapons to teachers willing to carry arms. It is not clear how that will be received by administrators, teachers, students and parents. Some of the student survivors of the shooting have become leaders in a national youth gun-control movement, and the Broward County School Board voted in April not to accept state money appropriated for that purpose.\\n\\nThe South Florida Sun Sentinel quoted Broward County School Board member Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter Alyssa was killed in the shooting:\\n\\nTeachers went to school to teach. That is their expertise. Law enforcement, their expertise is supposed to be to engage a threat. Unfortunately, that didn't happen on 2/14, but I still think we should leave it in the hands of law enforcement.\\n\\nThe commission made recommendations it said schools should adopt immediately, including keeping school gates and doors locked when not in use, and making sure school personnel are present when gates and doors are being used. All doors should be locked, too, and teachers should be able to lock them from the inside, with access to the keys.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt also said every school should have a Code Red plan for emergencies and should train staff to execute that plan and communicate it to everyone at the school.\\n\\nAnd the panel said school safety requires attention to the mental health of students and acknowledged:\\n\\nFlorida's mental and behavioral health system is underfunded. Florida needs a better case management system, but no case management system can be effective unless there are effective services through which a person can be managed."}
{"original": "But a fighting force — even one as formidable as the United States military — isn't truly ready unless its members have confidence that their needs are being addressed on the home front. For service members, a major component of readiness is knowing that as they move from base to base with family in tow, the quality of their children's education doesn't suffer. Currently, though, readiness is being negatively impacted because many military families are making decisions about whether to leave the armed forces or to accept a move to a particular duty station based in part on the quality of the surrounding schools. These choices can create a brain drain that ultimately undermines the nation's fighting force.\\n\\nA recent survey of current and former military personnel conducted by my organization, the Collaborative for Student Success, along with the Military Times, a leading publication widely read by active duty and former U.S. military personnel, puts a finer point on the connection between the quality of K-12 education of military-connected children and readiness.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMore than one-third of respondents, 35 percent, said dissatisfaction with a child's education was or is a significant factor in deciding whether to continue military service; 40 percent said they either have declined or would decline a career-advancing job at a different military installation to remain at their current military facility because of high performing schools. When asked, Did moving between states as part of your military service add challenges to your children's education, 70 percent answered yes.\\n\\nThe vast majority of survey respondents — 90 percent — reported having spent more than five years in the military. They have years of experience and expertise that our armed forces can ill-afford to lose.\\n\\nTheir core concern is one that all American parents contend with: schools with standards that are inconsistent from district to district or state to state and that, in many instances, don't adequately prepare children for career or college. But what sets military families apart is that, by design, they are highly nomadic. Our armed forces function more effectively when officers and enlisted personnel, with their varied roles and tenure, are rotated among the many U.S. military installations. Children in military families attend as many as nine schools during their K-12 years.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe result: Over a million military-connected children, most of whom attend public schools, are exposed to the vagaries of our educational system far more than their peers in civilian families. As the Military Child Education Coalition reports, there is no consistent school-based data on the academic health of these students and without such data, decisions about children, time, money, and initiatives are at risk of being based on supposition rather than reality. Military parents are often left to make career-related decisions based on keeping kids in schools they are comfortable with or moving their families and placing kids in unfamiliar schools where they might wind up either ahead of or behind their new classmates.\\n\\nA new assessment of several states with large military populations found that military families face a number of education obstacles, with the performance of students varying dramatically depending on geography. The Lexington Institute concluded that a shortage of high-quality educational programs for military-connected students, such as Advanced Placement classes in high school, often restricts educational opportunities, negatively impacts educational achievement, causes military families to make tough choices, inhibits quick assimilation into school communities, and can reduce a family's satisfaction with a military career.\\n\\nThe study focused on four states with large military populations, including Virginia. Among the findings, it noted overall success in the state, which has a wide distribution of military families and has military kids in every district. But it also found that many districts struggle to meet the academic and social emotional needs of military-connected students.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nU.S. military leaders are beginning to recognize the readiness connection.\\n\\nBefore he retired, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno indicated that local school performance would be a factor in the placement of Army units around the country. If state and local officials intend to keep military bases in their communities, Odierno said in 2013, they better start paying attention to the schools that are outside and inside our installations. Because as we evaluate and as we make decisions on future force structure, that will be one of the criteria. He commissioned a study, highlighting which schools are successful — and which are not — to examine the quality of schools that serve the children of soldiers.\\n\\nLast year, then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter unveiled a policy allowing service members to remain at a particular duty station for an extended period in exchange for extended service.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAnd the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, taking effect next year, creates a tool, the military student identifier number, that will allow schools to keep tabs on test scores, graduation rates and other metrics for military-connected students."}

But the version of the Republican Party many of them once called home — one that took fidelity to the Constitution for granted — is critically endangered.

Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have proven loyal allies of the president.

Perdue reacted to the news Trump tried to bully Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) into reversing the election outcome by condemning as disgusting the taping and releasing of their Saturday conversation. And Loeffler on Monday declared she would join the dozen Republican senators who have pledged to oppose certifying Biden's electoral college win, repeating the pledge onstage with Trump at a rally in Dalton, Ga.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe wave of publicly reported contributions predates those latest developments. But Loeffler and Perdue both have campaigned for months as lockstep Trump backers, including by refusing to acknowledge Biden's win. Wall Street donors nevertheless have been showering the pair with contributions because they are worried that a Democratic Senate would help President-elect Joe Biden push for tighter regulations on the financial industry, CNBC's Brian Schwartz reports, citing an unnamed GOP strategist with banking industry clients.\\n\\nThe roster of high-profile financiers cutting checks directly to one or both of the incumbents in recent weeks, per Schwartz and our own review of the candidates' most recent federal election filings, includes: hedge fund billionaire John Paulson; Fortress Investment Group CEO Randal Nardone; Arsenal Capital partner Stephen McLean; Silver Point Capital CEO Edward Mule; AQR Capital Management co-founder Clifford Asness; Owl Rock Capital co-founder Doug Ostrover; and Soroban Capital co-founder Eric Mandelblatt.\\n\\nThey join a handful of industry titans who have backed the Republicans on an entirely different scale by giving to the Senate Leadership Fund, the Mitch McConnell-affiliated super PAC. Blackstone Group co-founder Stephen Schwarzman gave that group $15 million on Nov. 12, the same day Citadel founder Ken Griffin forked over $10 million.\\n\\nAs Dawsey notes, Schwarzman didn't sign the CEO letter on Monday, but Jonathan Gray, the firm's president and chief operating officer, did.\\n\\nLoeffler and Perdue personify the challenge facing right-leaning business leaders uncomfortable with the party's trajectory.\\n\\nBoth appear willing to do whatever it takes to stay in Trump's good graces.

But Russia should be fighting, the reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia, they were right to be there, the problem is it was a tough fight and literally they went bankrupt, they went into being called Russia again as opposed to the Soviet Union.\\n\\nWell, where to begin? For starters, the syntax is so mangled one could be genuinely skeptical he was saying anything more than, Russia. Afghanistan. Give it to Putin.\\n\\nBeyond the incoherence is the horrifying realization that Trump endorsed the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, an action regarded for decades as inimical to interests of the United States and the Free World. (You'll recall for 45 years we opposed the invasion of independent states by an expansionist Communist dictatorship.) Former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul reacted with horror, as any informed public figure likely would:\\n\\nThis strikes me as a typical Trumpian word salad that reveals his sketchy and inadequate grasp of the geopolitics of Afghanistan, says former ambassador to Turkey, Eric S. Edelman. The Soviet Union went into Afghanistan to prop up one faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) against another. Their invasion catalyzed the existing Islamist opposition to the PDPA but I digress. (In other words, Trump's claim Russia went into Afghanistan to stop terrorist attacks is flat-out wrong.) Edelman adds, Simply put he has no idea what he is talking about.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf you want to try making sense of the gobbledygook, let's start with the biggest logical inconsistency. If Afghanistan brought down the Soviet Union — and virtually no credible historian or policy expert would deny it played a part nor argue it was the sole cause — why would Russian President Vladimir Putin go back in?\\n\\nI am glad Trump brought up the end of the Soviet Union, however. The U.S.S.R. didn't magically change its name; the West won the Cold War (until this president) through a combination of a sustained military buildup, strategic alliances, coercive diplomacy and moral clarity — all things Trump has abandoned with the exception of military funding (although it is far from clear this reflects any coherent national security strategy). Putin views the fall of the Soviet Union as a great calamity and seeks a low-cost means of reestablishing Russia as a great power, which Trump unfortunately has aided and abetted, most recently by handing Syria to Russia and its ally Iran.\\n\\nMore to the point, why is Trump handing off chunks of the world — Syria, Afghanistan, the Sea of Azov — to America's greatest international foe? (Some think it's a payoff for 2016 election help; others attribute his moves to protection of personal finances.) And where does this giveaway stop — at the Baltics? At Berlin? (It's stunning that hawks such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who'd melt down if President Barack Obama had said any of this, remain dependable sycophants for a president aiming to destroy the world order they too used to defend.)\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's latest blather actually provides insight into his real thinking. His policy is not America First — as in America leads the world and creates conditions to our benefit. Rather it is, Russia First as long as we can pull up the drawbridge, extinguishing robust trade and legal immigration. If Ronald Reagan's response when asked how the Cold War would end was, We win, they lose, Trump's is: Putin wins. Let's bury our heads in the sand.\\n\\nEliot A. Cohen, perhaps the most insightful and tenacious Trump critic on foreign policy, wrote recently for Foreign Affairs, The president has outlined a deeply misguided foreign policy vision that is distrustful of U.S. allies, scornful of international institutions, and indifferent, if not downright hostile, to the liberal international order that the United States has sustained for nearly eight decades. He explains, The real tragedy, however, is not that the president has brought this flawed vision to the fore; it is that his is merely one mangled interpretation of what is rapidly emerging as a new consensus on the left and the right: that the United States should accept a more modest role in world affairs.\\n\\nIn short, at a time when we should fortify alliances, enhance diplomacy, bolster foreign aid, draw clear distinctions between democracies and authoritarians, and expand trade, we are doing the opposite, which merely encourages the go-it-alone voices on the right and the we-can-do-no-good-anyway voices on the left.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nWe should be worried, as Cohen points out, that Trump is not merely incoherent but also choosing decline for America. Perhaps his outbursts are an expression of something deeper and more consequential: a permanent shift, among American leaders, away from the dominant postwar conception of U.S. foreign policy. . . . Trump's foreign policy vision would amount to a doctrine—one in which the United States is merely one great power among others. In this view, Washington should pursue its own interests, stand for freedom chiefly at home and only intermittently abroad, and reject as a matter of principle the international organizations that previous generations of U.S. leaders so carefully built.\\n\\nThe result of Trump's inanities and the world view it represents will be more aggressive foes (both nation states and terrorist groups); the decline of friendly, liberal democracies as belligerent authoritarian regimes emerge; a world economic system dominated by China; a less dynamic American economy; the re-creation of ungovernable havens for terrorists (as was the case before 9/11); nuclear proliferation; and unabated climate change.

{"original": "In a nutshell, Robb argues that trade — rather than national security — dominates Trump's foreign policy thinking, inverting decades of U.S. practice. By implication, that makes any country running a large trade surplus with the United States a direct competitor.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIf Robb is right, that's very bad news for China, but it doesn't make welcome reading for countries such as Mexico, Germany and Japan. Unless they can take steps to reduce their trade imbalances with the United States, they are unlikely to be fully trusted by a man who sees trade as a zero-sum game, and sees anyone beating the United States as a threat.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFirst, here's the analysis, in Robb's own words:\\n\\nSince WW2, U.S. foreign policy has been completely dominated by national security policy. In fact, it's hard to imagine a U.S. policy that doesn't view the world through a militaristic, cold war lens. This means that ALL other aspects of foreign policy are conducted in support of (slaved to) national security policy. In particular, U.S. trade policy is configured to promote the economic growth of allied nations (originally to fight the Cold War) even if these trade relationships damage U.S. economic performance.\\n\\nTrump inverts that policy relationship. In Trump's post-Cold War world, U.S. foreign policy will be dominated by trade policy. Even national security policy will be subservient to trade policy. If trade policy is dominant, we'll see China, Mexico and the EU (Germany) become competitors. Russia, in contrast will become an ally since it doesn't pose a trade threat.\\n\\nSo what does this mean in practice? China runs by far the largest trade surplus with the United States, some $319 billion in 2016. That's nearly half of the U.S. trade deficit of $666 billion with just one country. In fact, China bought just $104 billion in U.S. goods last year, but exported some $423 billion worth of goods to the United States.\\n\\nNo surprise, then, that Trump took less than 10 seconds into the first presidential debate to slam China for devaluing its currency and stealing American jobs.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, of course, has also taken issue with China over its island-building in the South China Sea, and he has publicly questioned American adherence to the one-China policy, the basis for diplomatic relations between the two countries that rules out independence for the island of Taiwan.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut the implication of the trade-first philosophy is that neither Taiwan nor the South China Sea really matters to Trump, except as ways to beat up on a country he sees as a direct economic threat.\\n\\nIndeed, he has suggested as much, telling Fox News last month that he didn't know why the United States had to be bound by the one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe other implication, of course, is that the deterioration in U.S.-China relations is probably here to stay, as long as Trump sticks around in the White House.\\n\\nBeijing could generate goodwill by moving to open its markets more to foreign goods and investment, and Trump could declare victory if he convinces a manufacturer here and there to relocate to some jobs from Asia to the United States. But China's trade surplus is unlikely to vanish overnight.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHere's Robb again:\\n\\nNational security under this regime will be used to reinforce and grow positive trade relationships. For example, military tension with China creates the opportunity for sanctions that simulate the function of tariffs (allowing the U.S. to circumvent trade organizations and domestic resistance to tariffs). In a national security policy slaved to trade, any and all security guarantees extended to other nations will require a positive trade arrangement with the U.S. The U.S. simply won't protect or extent security guarantees to any nation that has a non-beneficial economic relationship with the U.S. (i.e. runs a trade deficit).\\n\\nOf course, trade and national security are arguably not either-or choices, but are often interlinked. Indeed, China's large trade surplus is one reason it has been able to extend its influence across Asia and the rest of the world, in ways that have clear national security implications for the United States. Yet Robb's argument does yield interesting insights, so let's run with it a little further.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe second-largest U.S. trade deficit in 2016 was with Japan, at $62.4 billion. Japan largely got a pass from the United States when it used protectionism and state subsidies to build its industries after World War II: then, it was seen as a key strategic ally worth supporting despite running a large trade surplus with the United States.\\n\\nTrump, wearing trade rather than national security glasses, sees a much less rosy picture. Japan's auto trade is not fair, he said this week. He has also warned Toyota could face tariffs if it builds a car factory in Mexico, and he argued that Japan's government should pay more of the cost of stationing U.S. troops in Okinawa.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe same goes for South Korea, which runs a $26.5 billion trade surplus with the United States. Trump has taken aim at the cost of the strategic alliance and criticized a free trade deal agreed between the two countries during the Obama administration.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThird on the list comes Germany, with a trade surplus with the United States running at $59.6 billion in 2016. If trade is all that matters, perhaps, it should not have come as such a surprise to hear Trump strike right at Berlin's heart when called NATO obsolete and argued that U.S. partners are not paying what they are supposed to be paying.\\n\\nIndeed, he implicitly argues, why should the United States be bearing a disproportionate burden of the cost of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization when, as he suggested in a recent interview, Germany is just another one of those countries being very unfair to the U.S.?\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has also taken aim at German carmakers, asking why so many Americans drive a Mercedes-Benz when Germany buys so few Chevrolets, and criticizing BMW over plans to build a new plant in Mexico. His criticism may have been unjustified, as Bertel Schmidt argues in Forbes, but perhaps only to be expected.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump has accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel of ruining the country with her immigration policy, and the two leaders clearly have a very different worldview. But perhaps trade is the real root of Trump's distrust of Germany.\\n\\nFourth on the list comes Mexico, which ran a trade surplus with the United States of $58.8 billion in 2016. Trump, of course, is already preparing to build that wall, and get the Mexicans to pay for it.\\n\\nOf course, this framework is only one way of looking at Trump's foreign policy priorities, and it doesn't explain his hawkish stance over Iran or concern over North Korea's nuclear program."}
{"original": "Children from Oyster Adams Elementary walk to their school. A new policy aims at giving parents more choices to enroll students in charter schools within walking distance of their homes. (Kate Patterson for The Washington Post) (Kate Patterson/For The Washington Post)\\n\\nThousands of D.C. children who live near public elementary charter schools could soon qualify for a new admission preference to help them enroll in those schools under a plan Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced Monday.\\n\\nUnder the city's current policy, students have a guaranteed seat in a traditional public school near their home. But those assigned neighborhood schools — all part of the D.C. Public Schools — are sometimes more than a half mile away. That can make it hard for elementary students to walk to school.\\n\\nIn those cases, Bowser said, families that live no more than a half mile from a charter school should get special consideration through the city's school lottery system. The mayor said she wants to make it easier for more of our students to enroll in charter schools that are within walking distance of their home.\\n\\nBowser's proposal for a walkability preference would target an estimated 10,000 students who live more than a half mile away from their assigned traditional school but less than a half mile from a charter school. Charter schools would not be required to offer an admission preference to those students, but they would be allowed to do so.\\n\\nThe policy, if approved by the D.C. Council, would take effect in the 2018-19 school year. It could have a significant effect on a public education marketplace that gives parents many options. About 29,000 students from pre-kindergarten through 5th grade were enrolled in D.C. Public Schools in 2015-16, compared to about 21,600 in charter elementary schools that year.\\n\\nBowser has pushed to increase school choice in the District. But some education advocates questioned Monday's proposal. They said it could drain students from traditional D.C. schools and make it harder for students from low-income families to get into top charter schools, which are often located outside of their neighborhoods.\\n\\nIn 2012, a 12-member D.C. task force considered whether to require all charter schools to offer a neighborhood preference, but the idea was rejected.\\n\\nCouncil member David Grosso (I-At Large), who chairs the Council's education committee, said he has some reservations about the proposal and has already heard some vocal uproar.\\n\\nThis is very complicated stuff that could perpetuate divisions within our city and communities, and it will have to be very thought through, Grosso said. I am not too inclined to support it, but I am open to having a conversation.\\n\\nUnder the lottery system, there are charter school enrollment preferences for children of founding board members and siblings of current students. Grosso said adding another preference would possibly deny students an equal opportunity to enroll in quality schools.\\n\\nIt is unknown how many of the District's 82 elementary charter schools support the measure. Scott Pearson, executive director of the D.C. Public Charter School Board, called the measure an interesting enrollment proposal that addresses real issues families face.\\n\\nHe added, All preferences have complex effects so we're speaking with school leaders and others to better understand their perspectives.\\n\\nEboni-Rose Thompson, the chair of the Ward 7 education council, said she fears the changes would mean less access to high-quality schools. In Ward 7, for example, there are no dual-language charter schools. Most of those schools are in Wards 1 and 4. Under the proposal, some students in Ward 1 might have greater access to those schools because they live near them. That would leave fewer seats available for students from Ward 7.\\n\\nWhen we accepted charters into the city, they were supposed to be city-wide schools. What happened to that? Thompson asked. Do we just throw that away because we are trying to get at a different problem?\\n\\nCaryn Ernst, a parent activist, sits on a mayoral task force that aims to increase collaboration between charters and the school system. Ernst said she was surprised to learn about Bowser's proposal. The task force last fall considered and rejected a similar idea, according to Ernst.\\n\\nThe idea that she would announce this is astonishing to me and it completely undermines the purpose of a task force, Ernst said.\\n\\nBowser also proposed raising annual facilities funding for charter schools, to $3,193 per pupil. That would be 2.2 percent more than the current level of $3,124 per pupil.\\n\\nBowser announced her proposals at D.C. Bilingual Public Charter School in Northeast Washington, along Pearson and Deputy Mayor for Education Jennifer C. Niles. John Davis, the interim chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, was not present.\\n\\nAntwan Wilson, the incoming chancellor of DCPS, starts his new job Wednesday.\\n\\nMichelle Lerner, the spokeswoman for DCPS, said the school system looks forward to working with the city on the lottery changes so that all families can access high-quality schools."}
{"original": "According to standard conceptions of democracy — which focus on violations of civil liberties, including freedom of speech, assembly and the press — Hungary's status as an autocracy is ambiguous. The two most widely used indexes of democracy — conducted by Freedom House and Polity — continue to code Hungary as democratic.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nClearly, Hungary is not a democracy. But understanding why requires a nuanced understanding of the line between democracy and autocracy.\\n\\nDemocracy requires a level playing field\\n\\nIn our work on hybrid or what we call competitive authoritarian regimes, we show how democracy can be fundamentally compromised even without obvious civil liberties violations or electoral fraud. Leaders can create an uneven playing field by using administrative powers to strengthen their party and systematically deny the opposition access to crucial resources, media or state institutions. These autocrats submit to meaningful multiparty elections — but engage in serious democratic abuse.\\n\\nIn any democracy, elected officials have advantages over their challengers, including an easier time attracting media coverage and business support, because the government can deliver resources and policy benefits. But an uneven playing field means leaders use those advantages in ways that profoundly impair the opposition's ability to compete. Let's look at how that works.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFirst, leaders may systematically prevent opposition parties from gaining financial resources. Former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma, for example, regularly ordered tax authorities in the 1990s and 2000s to audit businesses that financed the opposition. Governing parties may also create a biased news media. In Malaysia, all major private newspapers and private television stations were controlled by individuals or firms linked to the governing party.\\n\\nGoverning parties may also manipulate the rules to disadvantage the opposition. The most common example is gerrymandering — drawing election districts where the governing party is far more likely to win. A country is not a democracy when gerrymandering makes it all but impossible for the opposition to win national power.\\n\\nFinally, ruling parties may pack judiciaries, electoral commissions and other nominally independent bodies to ensure that the incumbent will win critical electoral, legal or other disputes.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAuthoritarianism, Hungarian style\\n\\nOrban's Hungary is a prime example of a competitive autocracy with an uneven playing field. In 2010, Orban's Fidesz party won 53 percent of the vote and 68 percent of parliamentary seats. Since then, the party has increasingly denied opposition access to resources necessary to compete for power.\\n\\nFirst, Fidesz infiltrated much of the state bureaucracy. By 2012, Fidesz loyalists were already entrenched in every corner of the state, as Miklós Bánkuti, Gábor Halmai and Kim Lane Scheppele documented — including in the constitutional court, budget council, electoral commission, national judicial office, state audit office, public prosecutor's office and national bank. That brings significant advantages. For example, in the 2014 elections, the electoral commission rejected a wide range of complaints on inconsistent and formalistic grounds.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFinally, Fidesz has changed the electoral rules in ways that make it easier for the party to dominate. That includes significant gerrymandering — splitting off constituencies with a leftist majority to dilute the opposition vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFidesz's opposition is weak for many reasons having nothing to do with Orban's abuse of power — including scandals and economic problems from the 2000s, when opposition leaders last held power. But the uneven playing field creates a daunting obstacle to opposition victory at the ballot box.\\n\\nThe advantages of an uneven playing field\\n\\nKilling a journalist or firing on crowds of protesters can easily rally international opinion and turn an autocrat into a pariah. But few notice or care if party supporters infiltrate the electoral commission or a pro-government entrepreneur uses government funds to take control over an opposition website. And using the legal system to force out independent voices enables the government to argue that it has not abused power. For example, after forcing a leading independent university out of Hungary, the government argued that this was the result of a perfectly reasonable requirement under Hungary's legislation.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFidesz's ambiguous tactics have succeeded. Most importantly, the European Union has, with a few exceptions, failed to confront Orban's government about its democratic backsliding. As long as Orban is able to maintain such ambiguity, he is unlikely to face serious consequences for his country's democratic failures.\\n\\nLucan Ahmad Way is a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\\n\\nSteven Levitsky is a professor of government at Harvard University."}
{"original": "She continued in her role as editor in chief of the Texas Tribune but could not get the idea out of her head. In March last year, she sat down with Amanda Zamora, the Tribune's chief audience officer and a veteran of the investigative nonprofit ProPublica, and presented her idea.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYou could tell she was completely taken with this idea of a site that looked at the impact of politics and policy on women, Zamora said. Once she is set on something, you have no doubt that she's going to make it happen, and I knew it was something I wanted to participate in.\\n\\nThe two were soon holding meetings with advisers and funders, pitching them on their vision and honing it as they went.\\n\\nOn Monday, Ramshaw and Zamora are launching the 19th, the organization that grew out of all those meetings, with nearly $5 million in the bank from funders such as Craigslist founder Craig Newmark and Kathryn Murdoch, a climate change activist and philanthropist.\\n\\nThis isn't the day's news but pink. This is unique, original coverage about the roles of gender in politics and policy, said Ramshaw, who is CEO of the nonprofit. We are not doing turn-of-the-screw reporting, but rather what that turn of the screw means for different parts of the women's electorate.\\n\\nThe name derives from the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which in practice granted white women the right to vote, and whose 100th anniversary is this summer. Given that the goal of the site is to elevate the voices of women who are underrepresented in the American media, be it women of color, women living off the coasts, and poor women, Ramshaw said, they added an asterisk to their logo.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe 19th Amendment did not grant all women equal access to the voting booths immediately, said Zamora, the site's publisher, citing the 40 years it took for the civil rights movement to grant women of color the same voting rights as white women. The 19th provides a great opportunity to talk about all of those tensions and all the work that is still to be done in terms of equity whether it is at the ballot box or beyond.\\n\\nThe organization is launching with a single reporter in the field, Errin Haines, who previously covered race and ethnicity for the Associated Press. She will cover the 2020 race. A bare-bones site is launching Monday. Until 19thnews.org is fully built later this year, the 19th's articles will publish on The Washington Post's website.\\n\\nNewmark was among the first donors and made a $500,000 gift. We need a news outlet about gender politics that does a lot of fact-checking with absolutely no mansplaining, he said in an interview.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nKathryn Murdoch, the wife of Rupert Murdoch's younger son, James, pledged $1 million to the venture. Convinced by polling showing women had vastly different views from men on issues such as climate change and Trump, Murdoch saw the relevance of Ramshaw's idea.\\n\\nYou need to have a very healthy media ecosystem in order to support a functioning democracy, and I look at everything we do as how do we find the actual crux of some of the problems rather than putting Band-Aids on them after they develop, Murdoch said.\\n\\nWhen asked how the 19th was different from the news outlets her family owns, which include Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, she simply said the 19th and the foundation she and her husband operate are reflective of her values.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nShe and her husband were recently critical of the way Murdoch media properties have covered the Australian wildfires. In an interview with The Post, she shied away from commenting about Fox News or other Murdoch outlets. This is what I do, and I'm happy to be taken to task on any of it, but that is all I control.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA few years ago I might have said, 'No, no [to Ramshaw], things are gradually changing and getting better, and we'll get there,'  Murdoch said. But the rejection of a female candidate in the 2016 election was a wake-up call: It was a turning point to realize that things don't just naturally get better over time, you have to actively participate and make them get better, and there's always a risk of backsliding.\\n\\nRamshaw is not accepting anonymous donations to the site and will maintain a list of funders on the site in an effort to be as transparent as possible about who is supporting the journalism at the 19th.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOn launch day, the organization, which has hired an editor in chief, will post 17 jobs; nine in the newsroom including beats covering women in Congress, in the economy, statehouses and several others. They are hiring to fill positions to cover specific demographics that make up the female electorate, including black and Latina women. The site will have no opinion or editorial section.\\n\\nAnd the publication is not averse to hiring men — its CFO is male."}
{"original": "You shouldn't be enduring this, Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said during a conference call Friday with federal union leaders and members. This is truly a shutdown [that] makes no sense whatsoever. Government should be open, should never have closed.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nHearing from rank-and-file feds might give Trump a better idea of the difficulties they are facing and a more realistic sense of their views on being locked out of their jobs and required to work with no guarantee of pay. Payday this Friday is in grave danger of disappearing.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump, who suggested the shutdown could last for months or even years, displayed woeful ignorance of the plight of federal workers at a news conference Friday, when he said they would encourage him to keep going with the shutdown, because a border wall is far more important than a fully operational government. He apparently got that impression from Border Patrol officers he met with Thursday. These officers, federal workforce outliers, endorsed his wall, just as they did his candidacy, even though they are also victims of his shutdown.\\n\\nIt comes down to border security. … We are extremely grateful to President Trump, and we fully support what he is doing to take care of our nation's borders, Art Del Cueto, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, said during a Thursday news conference with Trump.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTalk with federal employees and you'll quickly learn that sentiment doesn't reflect the views of many, including those in the council's parent union, the American Federation of Government Employees. During the conference call Friday, AFGE's policy director Jacqueline Simon made it clear that the council's stance does not reflect that of the union.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nNo matter what some of our members may think of Mr. Trump's agenda on immigration and border security, we know that all of them, they need their paychecks and they can't go to the grocery store, pay their rent or their child-care expenses with their love of a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border, Simon said. We know our members and every single agency affected by the shutdown are terrified that when the day comes that there's no paycheck on payday.\\n\\nIf Trump talked to more federal employees, he would hear stories from people like Katherine Scheflen, a lawyer in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. She needs her check on time. I am a single mother of two disabled children. I live paycheck to paycheck, as do many Americans, she said. It is not complicated — if I miss a paycheck, I cannot pay my mortgage and my other bills. It is as simple as that.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nCongress will probably provide backpay for furloughed federal employees such as Scheflen. But the likelihood of money in the future doesn't pay bills due today. Backpay for low-wage contractors, like those who serve lunch in federal cafeterias, is less likely.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nI live pay check to pay check like nearly all of my coworkers, and I'm scared that with losing weeks of income and my healthcare benefits, one family medical emergency for myself, my children, or my grandchildren during Donald Trump's shut down could make us homeless, said Lisa Earle in a statement provided by Unite Here, which represents the Smithsonian worker. It's not fair that politicians playing games put me out of work, and it's even worse that my coworkers and I may never get back pay for the shutdown when we're just as impacted as all other federal workers.\\n\\nIt's ludicrous that Americans are denied federal services and workers like Scheflen and Earle suffer because Trump and Democrats differ over $4 billion for the border wall in a $4 trillion budget. Trump bogusly and repeatedly promised during his 2016 presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for his unpopular wall proposal.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nYet, while there is certainly an argument to be made for Democrats to meet Trump's hostage demands, make no mistake, this is Trump's shutdown, and increasingly that of congressional Republicans.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTrump's intransigence demonstrates the hollowness of the Republican position. He rejects, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refuses to consider, appropriation measures the Senate approved last month that would end the shutdown. The House voted for the legislation after Democrats took control last week, but McConnell won't call for a necessary vote in the Senate.\\n\\nThe legislation would fund agencies indirectly related to border security. The Department of Homeland Security would receive temporary funding, providing a month for the discussions to continue.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nIt should be a no-brainer. McConnell called the House approval a time-wasting act of political posturing, even though the House followed the lead of his Republican-controlled Senate.\\n\\nWe're just going to have to work very hard, Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said on the call with Cardin, to increase the pressure on Mitch McConnell to hold that vote.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAmerican voters will increase that pressure as government services continue to deteriorate."}

Leading infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Operation Warp Speed chief Moncef Slaoui have all recently roundly rejected proposals to alter the timeline of the two-dose vaccine regimen.\\n\\nThere really are no data on what happens if you delay the second dose by three months or four months or two months, Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday. Fauci said that there was more interest in potentially administering two half-doses of the coronavirus vaccine, but that at this point the main obstacle was efficiently getting doses we already have into people.\\n\\nSo far, the United States has only administered a small fraction of the vaccine doses that have been distributed to states, according to a Washington Post tracker, which looks at vaccine priorities and administration state by state.\\n\\nVaccine administration rates vary across states. While Georgia has vaccinated 0.7 percent of its population, South Dakota has vaccinated 3 percent of its population.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nMost states have adopted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and are prioritizing health-care workers and nursing home residents and staff, followed by front-line essential workers and individuals over the age of 75.

Britain's health minister Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today program that this variant could be even more of a problem than the UK new variant. The South Africa variant has additional mutations to the virus's spike protein, sparking concerns that existing vaccines may not be as effective against it. John Bell, a professor of medicine at the University of Oxford and a member of Britain's vaccine task force, said it would be unlikely for the vaccines to be entirely ineffective but that it might be necessary to tweak existing vaccines.\\n\\nOUCH: Young ER doctors who risked their lives in the pandemic are struggling to find jobs.\\n\\nYoung doctors, called residents, who specialize in emergency medicine are struggling to find full-time employment even while working on the front lines of the covid-19 response.

On Jan. 4, 2020, the World Health Organization tweeted that it was investigating a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The following day the U.S. agency said that China reported its first cases to the WHO on Dec. 31, 2019, and that at least 44 cases had been reported, The Post's Siobhán O'Grady reports\\n\\nBecause vaccine doses must be used within a certain time frame once they have been removed from refrigeration, some lucky individuals who are not in priority groups have been able to get early doses. This happened, for instance, at a Giant Foods store in Northeast Washington, D.C., where a pharmacist flagged down a law school student who happened to be shopping at the store after several first responders missed their appointments, The Post's Lola Fadulu reports . The decision was in line with guidance from the D.C. Department of Health, which instructs providers to use any vaccine doses that might otherwise go to waste.\\n\\nElsewhere in health care\\n\\nA high-profile venture that promised to disrupt health care is disbanding.\\n\\nHaven, created two years ago by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway to address soaring health-care costs and improve patient outcomes, announced in a terse statement on its website Monday that it will shutter, The Post's Jay Greene reports.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThe venture sent shock waves through the medicine field when it was announced three years ago, with an ambitious promise that the combined forces of the three major companies could lead to massive cost-cutting across the health-care system. The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy, Berkshire's Warren Buffett said in a statement at the time. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.\\n\\nBut the initiative is ending with little to show for its efforts, as health-care costs continued to grow in 2019, accounting for 17.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. A spokesperson for Haven said that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase would continue to leverage insights gained from the joint-venture.

Doctors worry that the covid pandemic will only lead to more overprescribing, Kaiser Health News's Laura Ungar reports.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in January found that 1 in 4 children given antibiotics in U.S. children's hospitals are prescribed the drugs inappropriately — the wrong types, or for too long, or when they're not necessary, she continues. The study could even be an underestimate because it focused on 32 children's hospitals that were already working to reduce antibiotic use.\\n\\nResearchers say that the overprescription of antibiotics is fueling drug resistant strains of dangerous bacteria like Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile."}
{"original": "But it's now far from clear when — or even if — the panic-inducing drawdown will take place. Trump seemed chastened by the backlash in Washington and extended his initial 30-day deadline for the pullout to four months. Administration officials have since muddied the waters further, briefing reporters that there is no timeline for withdrawal whatsoever.\\n\\nWe're pulling out of Syria, Trump said Sunday, before offering a significant caveat. But ... we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAt the heart of the chaos is a clear split within the White House. Trump, who espouses a kind of nationalist isolationism, is keen on disentangling the United States from costly military adventures that offer him minimal political returns at home.\\n\\nUnlike many Republican wonks in Washington, Trump was never interested in removing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power. In December, he perfunctorily declared that the Islamic State had been defeated — despite mountains of evidence to the contrary — and said it was largely the responsibility of Turkey and other Arab countries to carry on the fight.\\n\\nNational security advisor John Bolton said on Jan. 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that Turkey will not target Kurdish forces. (Reuters)\\n\\nLeading hawks in Washington, including key figures within the administration, see things much differently. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and Trump's special envoy to Syria, former diplomat James Jeffrey, all argue that U.S. military involvement in Syria is aimed not just at defeating Islamist militants but also at countering Iranian influence in Syria.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nA U.S. official told The Washington Post that Trump never personally endorsed this strategy, and the president has publicly hinted as much. During a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump offhandedly remarked that Iran's leadership can do what they want in Syria.\\n\\nThe top brass in the Pentagon, meanwhile, is hardly convinced that the Islamic State has been defeated. Military officials have voiced deep reservations about the speedy departure at a moment when the extremists, though severely weakened, remain a potent threat and Turkey continues to prioritize its fight against the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which it considers part of a Kurdish terrorist group, over the battle against the Islamic State, my colleagues reported.\\n\\nThis week, senior administration officials are jetting around the Middle East in a bid to assuage allies that the White House is still committed to their security interests. But so far, they're mostly betraying the discord within the administration over what comes next.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nPompeo, a vocal advocate of the anti-Iran strategy, will make an eight-country swing through all six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman — as well as Egypt and Jordan. He will try to present a united front despite the White House's increasingly incoherent approach to the region.\\n\\nThe counter-Iran campaign continues, Pompeo told right-wing outlet Newsmax on Thursday. We'll do all of those things. … We will simply do it at a time when the American forces have departed Syria.\\n\\nBolton, meanwhile, was in Israel over the weekend and will later head to Turkey, where he'll be accompanied by Jeffrey — the Syria envoy — and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Seemingly contradicting Trump, Bolton told reporters that no withdrawal from Syria will take place until the Islamist militants are fully defeated and Turkey guarantees the safety of Syrian Kurdish units allied with the United States but considered terrorist enemies by Ankara.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThere are objectives that we want to accomplish that condition the withdrawal, Bolton said. The timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\\n\\nThe facts on the ground suggest the timetable will be rather open-ended. The diplomatic wrangling with Turkey — which has vowed a military operation against Kurdish units across its southern border — may prove to be deeply complicated. A security guarantee for the Syrian Kurds could just be a new unobtainable condition, tweeted Faysal Itani of the Atlantic Council. Seeing their options dwindling, the main Syrian Kurdish armed faction has opened talks with the Assad regime, requesting military support from Damascus against a potential Turkish offensive.\\n\\nHawks in the Washington establishment have cheered Trump's apparent about-face. I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out, said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), telling CBS's Face the Nation that the bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the president for reevaluating what he's doing. ... He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBut others see the latest changes as more evidence of an administration conflicted and confused about its agenda overseas. Bolton got way out ahead of the policy, and it's his job to understand what the president wants, Robert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador in Syria, said to my colleagues. When the president is nervous or cautious about something, it's the NSC's job to relay that back to State and the Pentagon, and warn them not to go too far. Apparently they didn't get the message."}
{"original": "In normal times, restaurant and bar writers look for the new and different: breaking trends, hot chefs or bars that offer a vibe their neighbors don't. This inherent tendency to seek what's fresh and exciting is, I think, why businesses are so often praised and admired for pivoting to new models during the pandemic, when whiplash changes to menus and physical spaces are often born less of creative innovation than desperately trying to find a way for the business to stay afloat. For some, it was building a beer garden in the parking lot; for others, it was tossing out their critically acclaimed menus to make sandwiches and simpler fare.\\n\\nBut despite the chaos, there were some innovations that made the lives of staff and customers easier, or even better. The District changed alcohol laws to allow bars to sell cocktails and six-packs for carryout and delivery, providing a source of income when indoor spaces were closed to the public. The idea proved so popular that the regulations became permanent in October. No one can predict exactly when we'll get back to normal, but whenever that happens, I hope these other changes stick around.\\n\\nLet us drink (and dine) in closed streets and parking spaces.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nEarly in the pandemic, cities across the country began closing streets to traffic to provide more room for socially distanced running and biking. And by summer, as restaurants took their first steps toward reopening, they began to stake their own claims to the streets, moving tables into pedestrianized roads. The result was charming, comfortable and provided a sense of quasi-normalcy after spring's stay-at-home orders.\\n\\nThis wasn't a radical new idea: Annapolis closes busy West Street for a weekly street festival each summer, and Old Town Alexandria voted in 2019 to close a stretch of King Street on weekends between April and October. But the dire situation facing restaurants and bars forced local jurisdictions to reconsider their priorities: Diners enjoying a meal, a beer garden and entertainment outdoors were judged more important than drivers going a few blocks out of their way. With restaurants staring into a financial abyss, these models should continue for the foreseeable future. Make outdoor dining the destination, whether that's tables with waterfront views in Annapolis's historic downtown, or Bethesda's food court-style tables, which let visitors choose from any nearby restaurant — perfect for the group who can't decide on one cuisine.\\n\\nD.C., for a variety of reasons, didn't embrace street dining the way surrounding jurisdictions did — two round-the-clock, one-block closures north of Dupont Circle and the reclaimed service lane across from the Uptown Theater in Cleveland Park were more notable than a weekend-only closure of Eighth Street NW in Penn Quarter. (The closure of 18th Street NW in Adams Morgan, which nightlife advocates have long encouraged, lasted only one weekend because of complaints about crowding and lack of masks.) Where the city made the biggest impact was loosening restrictions on sidewalk cafes and allowing restaurants to turn adjacent parking spaces into parklets through the duration of the public health emergency. It was fun to see businesses get creative, decorating these spaces with greenery, tapestries, lights (and eventually heaters) to appeal to passersby and capture the personalities of the different establishments. Even after bars and restaurants are back to normal business, these should continue indefinitely, or be grandfathered in with a nominal annual rent.\\n\\nReplace tips with mandatory 20 percent service charges.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nTipping is a difficult topic. It's a vestige of Reconstruction-era discrimination that, according to study after study, perpetuates racism, sexism and ageism in dining rooms. But restaurant owners are loath to raise menu prices to the point where tipping isn't necessary to pay staff a real wage, because customers have become used to low, tip-subsidized prices. Some customers seem to really enjoy the feeling of power they have over restaurant and bar workers, mentally dinging percentage points off a tip if the steak isn't medium-rare or the wine glasses aren't topped up every time.\\n\\nBut when servers who are struggling to make ends meet are seeing both a decline in tips and a rise in sexual harassment, should we really be leaving an employee's rent money in the hands of people who ask servers to remove their masks before deciding to add or subtract a few bucks? Of course not.\\n\\nTo guarantee a decent wage, a number of places I've visited in the past year, from fancy restaurants to casual cocktail spots to rooftop beer gardens, have levied mandatory service charges of around 20 percent. They offer the chance to leave more, but not less, preventing customers from stiffing a server over a perceived slight. It's a great start — we should all be adding 20 percent anyway, right? — while the industry and governments come to grips with the mechanics and failures of tipping. Gratitude is a buzzword this year. Let's start with restaurant employees.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nLet us keep making reservations.\\n\\nI am not much for planning, partially because I don't want to tie myself down to being at a specific place at a set time weeks from now. (Maybe that's an issue for a professional to address.) I am also a traditionalist who is opposed to reserved seating in bar areas, as well as at beer gardens and breweries. Or at least I was.\\n\\nWith bar patios operating at a fraction of their capacity, an increasing number of establishments began to offer the ability to make reservations. In addition to higher-end destinations, I've made them for low-key neighborhood spots, like All Souls and Trusty's, where I've always just been happy to take my chances walking in and standing around until a seat opened up. And you know what? Having a guaranteed seat has been a godsend.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nDuring weekend visits to Archipelago or Cotton and Reed — two places where I had never made a reservation in my life — I repeatedly heard people walk up to the host, ask for a table, and be told none were available. In the summer, you might just wander off to see if a different restaurant in the neighborhood has space. In fall or winter, instead of supporting a struggling business, you might just go home rather than face getting rejected at the next bar, too. Visits to places that don't take reservations were just as awkward: Attempts to visit Wunder Garten or Dacha were aborted because we showed up to find long lines outside that didn't appear to be socially distanced.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nSome big outdoor spaces, such as the Midlands Beer Garden and Biergarten Haus, take reservations while leaving most space available for walk-ins — consider a booking an insurance policy — and I'd even think twice about making the trip out to some of the region's bigger farm breweries, including Wheatland Spring and Waredaca, if I hadn't reserved a table in advance. Will we return to a more laissez faire system of bar crawls in the future? Maybe. In the meantime, I'm going to stick to my calendar.\\n\\nContactless ordering and payment should stay an option — at some places.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nOne of the consequences of this pandemic, in which disease can be spread by asymptomatic people, is that we now stop and think about every potential interaction. After all, it's not just, If I eat at this restaurant, can a staff member or another diner make me sick? but, If I eat at this restaurant, could I make my server sick? As a result, an increasing number of establishments turned to technology that let customers place orders and pay from their phones, in an attempt to limit the face time between staff and customers. I have to admit, I kind of liked it.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nFarewell to the little dance where a server brings you water and disappears; comes back to take your drink order and disappears; returns with cocktails, recites the specials and disappears while you decide on what to have for dinner. The pace of the evening is now in your hands. Know what you want to drink? Order as soon as you sit down, and you can sip while deciding what to snack on. Anyone who's needed to make a quick exit because of a cranky child (or cranky adult who's had one too many), appreciates the ability to settle the bill instantly and quietly.\\n\\nThat said, there are bars where I want to engage the staff about new beers and cocktails on the menu, or solicit opinions about the best wine to complement an entree. Contactless ordering has the effect of turning professional servers into glorified food runners. But for large, busy spaces, such as beer gardens or slammed happy hour spots, tech might offer a better way forward.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nBreweries and distilleries: Please keep leaving booze on my doorstep.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nD.C. breweries and distilleries have always had the legal ability to deliver their products directly to consumers. Virginia and Maryland producers had a few more hoops to jump through, but could also deliver or ship beer. But it wasn't until the pandemic shut bars and tasting rooms, denying them much needed revenue, that most began to look into it.\\n\\nIt soon became a lifeline, with some brewery owners delivering cases by hand, and Rockville's True Respite setting up the popular biermi online order and delivery service, which they shared with breweries across the region. As shelves in supermarkets and liquor stores have become more crowded, delivery has become a new niche where breweries can stand out — look at 3 Stars and its monthly CSB delivery program, which puts unreleased, ultra-fresh beers in the hands of members before the general public. But more importantly, this is a way for breweries to use a perceived convenience as a way to introduce themselves to new audiences.\\n\\nI'd rather pay for rounds than run up a tab.\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAD\\n\\nThis is probably the most personal entry on the list, but as a (formerly) regular traveler to the United Kingdom, I've always enjoyed buying rounds in the pub instead of running up a tab. For those unfamiliar with the concept: You order drinks for the members of your group, and you pay for them on the spot. When glasses are close to empty, another member of the group gets and pays for drinks. Repeat. No waiting until the end of the night to split a check five ways or arguing with the itemizer who says but you had more drinks than me. (Dealing with people who duck out on rounds is a discussion for another time.)\\n\\nBartenders in the United States, though, tend to dislike the concept, because time is money, and they could be pouring beers or whipping up drinks instead of stopping to take cash or run credit cards from the same group multiple times throughout the night. It's more economical to just wait until everyone is leaving."}
