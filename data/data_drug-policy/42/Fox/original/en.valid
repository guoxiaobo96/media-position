president trump is deranged, unhinged, dangerous, and deserving of prosecution, house speaker nancy pelosi says in an interview scheduled to air sunday night on 60 minutes.\n\nthe san francisco democrat sat down for a conversation with lesley stahl of the cbs news program last week following wednesday's siege of the u.s. capitol by a crowd of protesters.\n\nis anybody running the executive branch of the government? who is running the executive branch? stahl asks in a preview clip released by cbs, implying that trump may have abdicated his position in the waning days of his term following criticism over the capitol security breach.\n\nwell, sadly, the person who's running the executive branch is a deranged, unhinged, dangerous president of the united states, pelosi asserts in response.\n\nand we're only a number of days until we can be protected from him. but he has done something so serious that there should be prosecution against him.\n\npelosi: capitol rioters chose their 'whiteness' over democracy\n\npelosi, 80, of course, is a frequent target of ire from president trump and other republicans, along with sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., the democrats' leader in the other chamber of congress. the gop typically regards democratic policy proposals as unnecessary, expensive, overly restrictive – or some combination thereof.\n\n'fire pelosi'\n\nat a trump rally near the white house that preceded the capitol siege, rep. mo brooks, an alabama republican and vocal trump supporter, wore a red cap saying fire pelosi, when he addressed the crowd on wednesday.\n\nin separate remarks saturday, in an online meeting with her san francisco constituents, pelosi characterized the capitol siege in racial terms, accusing the participants of having chosen their whiteness over a regard for american democracy.\n\nit has been an epiphany for the world to see that there are people in our country led by this president, for the moment, who have chosen their whiteness over democracy, pelosi said, according to the associated press.\n\n'nothing is off the table'\n\nlater in the 60 minutes clip, stahl then inquires whether lawmakers have declared the 25th amendment of the constitution – which outlines steps for removal of a sitting president – off the table in their conversations about how to react to trump after the capitol riot.\n\nno, it isn't. nothing is off the table, pelosi answered.\n\nwhat is the 25th amendment and how does it work?\n\nin another cbs preview clip, pelosi describes her experience inside the capitol as protesters were gathering outside and then entering the building.\n\ni was pulled from the podium, just literally pulled from the podium, pelosi says, presumably referring to capitol security personnel.\n\nthe volatile situation saw lawmakers – pelosi among them – seeking cover inside the building as protesters ran roughshod through hallways and even into lawmakers' offices.\n\nthey were vocally saying, 'where's the speaker? we know she has staff. they're here someplace. we're going to find them, pelosi tells stahl, though it was unclear whether the speaker was referring to security personnel or to members of the crowd.\n\nnews coverage of the siege included at least two widely distributed photos linked to pelosi: in one shot, a man is seen carrying a podium that authorities said was from pelosi's office, and in another shot a different man is seen seated inside pelosi's office, with his left foot up on one of the desks.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nboth men have reportedly been arrested in connection with the siege:\n\nthe man seen carrying the podium has been identified by authorities as adam christian johnson, 36, who was apprehended in pinellas county, fla. the justice department said johnson has been charged with one count of knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority; one count of theft of government property; and one count of violent entry and disorderly conduct on capitol grounds.\n\nthe man seen seated in pelosi's office has been identified by authorities as richard barnett, 60, of gravette, ark. he has been charged with violent entry and theft of public property, among other offenses, and was expected to be extradited to washington after his arrest in arkansas, authorities told fox news.\n\nfox news' audrey conklin and louis casiano and the associated press contributed to this story.

according to new york governor andrew cuomo, his leadership during the covid-19 pandemic has been worthy of many rewards: a new york times bestseller on leadership, a covid mountain poster he commissioned to be made and sold, an emmy, a ted kennedy award and a birthday party that you could attend virtually for $1,000 with a check made out to the andrew cuomo reelection campaign.\n\nif you ask those who lost loved ones in nursing homes, as my family did in 2020, his leadership has been a failure starting with his march 25 order to put covid positive patients into nursing homes for 46 days, and the subsequent cover-up of the total number of seniors we've lost since then.\n\nif cuomo had not spent valuable time promoting and celebrating himself for months, missing meetings with the white house in the fall and instead had prepared for the massive vaccine roll-out here in new york, maybe we wouldn't have the mess and mass confusion that is currently happening across the state.\n\none of the biggest problems we're facing right now is the complicated hierarchy that's been created designating who gets the vaccine first, and the very strict fines that are being implemented for hospitals who gave shots to anyone not on a prioritized list.\n\ncuomo's nursing home coronavirus policy: admin refuses record requests for study absolving him on deaths\n\neven the new york times has been getting tough with its headlines on what was happening:\n\nnew york's strict vaccine guidelines forced one clinic to throw away doses after it couldn't find eligible people\n\nwhy 300 doses of vaccine sat unused in freezer for 2 weeks…\n\nonce the vaccine distribution plan began, people started to notice who took priority first, and who wasn't being included. new york city mayor bill de blasio noticed that some first responders and those over the age of 70 were not at the front of the line:\n\nwe are not allowed by state law to give a single shot to a single new yorker over 75. he announced in a tweet.\n\nthe mayor went on talk shows and social media to ask why his own father wasn't allowed to get vaccinated yet and listened to many senior citizens raising their voices as to why they couldn't be prioritized for the vaccine since they were clearly the ones who needed it most.\n\ncuomo's book touting 'leadership' during pandemic released just before huge spike in covid cases, pundit notes\n\nthe shaming worked, and suddenly, cuomo announced that the elderly and city workers were now included. he said in a press conference on friday:\n\non monday, you can start to schedule appointments. pharmacies will start coming online, some on monday, more on wednesday…\n\nbut the governor never officially said when they could begin or how the registration would happen.\n\nny gov. cuomo's tone shifts after months of coronavirus lockdowns\n\nover the weekend we started to see reports about what a massive undertaking this distribution is and who might have a problem signing up.\n\nin a series of tweets new york city comptroller scott m. stringer wrote that the process of making appointments for the vaccination is complicated and buggy. especially for people over 75:\n\nthe @nychealthy site has a multi-step verification process just to set up an account, and then a six-step process to set up an appointment. along the way, there are as many as 51 questions of fields in addition to uploading images of your insurance card.\n\nall of this will be particularly challenging for populations that struggle with digital literacy and digital access – who have been hit hardest by the pandemic and who need to vaccine the most.\n\nnew york assemblyman ron kim, who is the chairman of the aging committee tweeted in response to stringer's tweet:\n\nfirst, it should be a two-step verification process to vaccinate older adults. but fixing hospital vaccination screening process is not the issue. why did the governor punt this to underfunded hospitals in the first place? why didn't the governor trust local protocols?\n\nkim told me in a text that he had informally surveyed some doctors and asked them why they thought the governor decided to trust hospitals to vaccinate the population. he says they overwhelmingly told him it's to make private hospitals look good.\n\ncritics mock ny gov. cuomo's sudden denunciation of lockdowns, suggest trump hacked his twitter account\n\nbill hammond is the senior fellow for health policy at empire center and has been one of the biggest advocates on transparency with the cuomo administration.\n\ni asked him in a text why this is so hard to do.\n\ngetting 8.3 million new york city residents organized to do anything is going to be hard. i'm struck by the lack of preparation. they could have foreseen the need for a registration system months ago. as it is, they seem to be managing things on the fly.\n\nhammond says he can see why they would want people to register for an appointment, to avoid crowding at vaccination sites. but if you're going to do that, it needs to be as simple as possible.\n\nideally, there would be one system for the city, and maybe the whole state. instead, it looks like we will have three.\n\nclick here for complete coronavirus coverage\n\ni then asked him why the governor decided to put this all on the shoulders of the hospital system.\n\nhere's his answer:\n\nhe evidently decided [that] they and their members (who are after all very smart and capable organizations) were better prepared to handle this job than city and county officials. the city's website rollout is probably the kind of thing he was worried about. but hospitals can't do everything. they have no particular experience of running mass vaccinations.\n\nthere are many reports showing every county in new york state has been planning and rehearsing this process of mass vaccinations for years.\n\nclick here to get the opinion newsletter\n\nhammond thinks the preparations never included setting up websites, and that it's better handled statewide. but, the governor should've known how hard this would be from the beginning.\n\nhe should have been working on exactly these issues since the summer or early fall. not involving the counties — who had already done some the prep work — seems like a major mistake, he told me.\n\nadd this to the list of the many mistakes the governor has made over the last 10 months, but won't answer for. he seemed to escape widespread criticism of his lethal executive order in march and the thousands of seniors who subsequently died. but maybe now people are taking notice:\n\nchris @masterjohn wrote:\n\nif cuomo's march directive forbidding nursing homes from preventing readmission of then infected covid-19 positive patients didn't convince you he hates old people, maybe the 51 step process they take to get vaccines with millions of dollars in fines will convince you.\n\nvoices for seniors, a group of grieving families that advocate for accountability, change and reform for our seniors, responded on twitter:\n\ngovernor cuomo and dr. zucker have made it clear: they feel our seniors are disposable. there's no other explanation for their continued and criminal mismanagement of everything covid; from nursing home policies to vaccine distribution.\n\nand now, with so many lives to try to save, maybe the governor should spend some time truly leading.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nbecause if the governor didn't learn this lesson in the spring, our most vulnerable need to be at the front of the line so that we can protect them and hopefully save their lives.\n\nafter all the loved ones we lost, it's the least he can do for the ones who are still with us.\n\nclick here to read more from janice dean
as the third day of the ongoing impeachment trial of president trump wrapped up in the senate chamber, most of the drama was elsewhere -- with one witness for the democrats accusing a republican senator of defamation and slander after she questioned his patriotism and implicated him in a scheme to take down trump from inside the white house.\n\nthe off-field spat began thursday evening on twitter, when tennessee gop sen. marsha blackburn quoted the commanding officer of lt. col. alexander vindman as saying that vindman was a political activist in uniform.\n\nvindman, a national security council official, testified during house democrats' impeachment inquiry last year that trump's ukraine dealings left him in a state of shock, and democrats were quoting from vindman's remarks during the senate trial on thursday. vindman has denied knowing the identity of the whistleblower who flagged trump's fateful july 25 phone call with ukraine's president -- a claim that republicans have questioned, because under cross-examination, vindman apparently admitted to leaking the contents of trump's call to the whistleblower.\n\nat the time, california democratic rep. adam schiff, presiding over the house impeachment inquiry, shut down gop attempts to press vindman as to whom he had leaked information about trump's call, saying it would potentially reveal the whistleblower's identity.\n\nblackburn tweeted as schiff spoke on thursday evening: adam schiff is hailing alexander vindman as an american patriot. how patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of russia, america's greatest enemy? ... alexander vindman broke the chain of command and leaked the contents of the president's july 25th phone call to his pal, the 'whistleblower.' over a policy dispute with the president! how is that not vindictive?\n\nschiff, in major reversal, admits he should have been clear about his own contact with the whistleblower\n\nit makes sense that alexander vindman leaked the july 25th phone call to his friend (aka the 'whistleblower'), blackburn continued. they both have lots in common: —held the same nsc job —liberals who worked under obama —wanted to take out trump.\n\nthe whistleblower's attorney, mark zaid, has openly recruited potential informants from within the intelligence community since 2017, when he declared that a coup has started against trump and predicted that impeachment would follow. zaid also attempted to solicit prominent actors to raise awareness to his efforts to oust trump, which began years before trump's call with ukraine's leader that ultimately led to his impeachment. zaid has further acknowledged that the whistleblower had contact with a prominent 2020 democratic presidential candidate, but has not commented on specifics.\n\nvindman's legal team fired back within hours.\n\nthis difficult moment in our country calls for seriousness and seriousness of purpose, david pressman, a lawyer with boies, schiller & flexner llp representing alexander vindman, said in a statement obtained by fox news. lieutenant colonel alexander vindman has sacrificed enormously for our country. he believes in our country. and he believes in our country's great institutions, including the united states senate.\n\ningraham investigation: more to uncover concerning bidens, burisma\n\npressman added: that a member of the senate – at a moment when the senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility – would choose to take to twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice. while senator blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, lieutenant colonel vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\n\nspeaking to the ingraham angle late thursday, blackburn doubled down, saying that she has spoken to many members of the military who have a problem with the way vindman circumvented the chain of command to try to undermine trump's foreign policy.\n\nwe honor the service of every man and woman in uniform, blackburn told anchor laura ingraham. you look at what his commanders said. he has a problem with his judgment. that's been pointed out. he had one commander who said he is a political activist in uniform. he has had problems with going outside of his chain of command, which is what he did here.\n\ni talk to a lot of military members on a regular basis, blackburn went on. they have a real problem with some of the things and the manner in which he conducted himself in this matter. what we want to do is make certain that we get to the heart of the issues here; we want to be certain the president is treated fairly. we want to make certain that we move through this and that we get back to the people's business, things they want to see us do, like putting more judges on the federal bench.\n\n'coup has started,' whistleblower attorney promised in 2017 tweets\n\nat one point during his impeachment testimony last year, vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by republican ohio rep. brad wenstrup. vindman testified that he did not discuss his concerns about trump's july phone call with the nsc's tim morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable. but, under questioning from wenstrup, morrison confirmed that vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that vindman testified morrison was unreachable.\n\nmorrison further testified he had heard others express concern that vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. asked about that allegation, vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.\n\nmeanwhile, it remained unclear whether vindman -- or any other witnesses -- would appear at the senate trial, with trump attorney jay sekulow telling reporters he didn't expect democrats would present a compelling enough case to justify that step, but that it was still too early to discuss the issue.\n\nchief justice roberts admonishes both sides, as first day of impeachment trial erupts into shouting match after midnight\n\non the whole, senators generally seemed somewhat more alert on thursday, the third full day of the ongoing senate impeachment trial and the second full day of the democrats' opening arguments in the case.\n\nit was a long day, alaska gop sen. lisa murkowski, a key moderate swing vote, told fox news as the day wrapped on thursday. i was one pooped puppy.\n\nshe said she might have a glass of wine and take a bath tonight to relax. on wednesday, murkowski said she was offended when democratic impeachment manager jerry nadler, d-n.y., tried to argue that senators would be participating in a coverup if they opposed democrats' document requests -- an aggressive move that apparently backfired in the chamber, and led to a rare intervention from chief justice john roberts.\n\non his way out of the senate on thursday, though, nadler said he was confident.\n\ni think we're making an airtight case for anyone who's willing to listen, nadler told fox news. the evidence is overwhelming. the president's counsels have not offered any evidence against it, nor will they, because there is no possibility. and as i said the other day, or yesterday, watch what the president's counselors say. it won't be refutations of the evidence; there won't be any new evidence, there will just be criticisms of the house managers, of our procedures, all irrelevant to the charges against the president.\n\nfrom the senate gallery on thursday, senators could be seen sitting in their seats for longer periods and intently taking what appeared to be more detailed notes than they were the previous two days. multiple senators told fox news they believe that's because senators are more rested today after the session on tuesday drifted into wednesday, before adjourning at 1:50 a.m. et.\n\nthe day brought few new arguments, as democrats focused primarily on the abuse of power impeachment article instead of the obstruction of congress charge. democrats' impeachment managers said there was no evidence that former vice president joe biden did anything improper in dealings with ukraine, and that president trump sought a political investigation of biden by ukraine solely to sway the 2020 election in his favor.\n\nthere was no basis for the investigation the president was pursuing and pushing. none. he was doing it only for his own political benefit, said rep. sylvia garcia, d-texas.\n\nsimilarly, they argued that there was no truth to the theory pushed by trump and his allies that ukraine meddled in the 2016 u.s. election. although democrats -- and some news outlets, including the associated press -- have repeatedly claimed that the idea of ukraine meddling is a conspiracy theory, a ukrainian court has ruled that officials in the country did illegally meddle in the u.s. election. additionally, a 2017 investigative report by politico found extensive efforts by ukrainians to hurt trump's presidential campaign.\n\nimpeachment backfire? key moderate republican says nadler's aggressive remarks have 'offended' senate\n\ntrump put himself first, ahead of u.s. policy and the national interest, schiff, acting as democrats' lead prosecutor, told the senate.\n\nadded new york rep. hakeem jeffries: the decision to grant or withhold an oval office meeting with [ukrainian] president zelensky had serious security concerns for both ukraine and the united states.\n\nyesterday, trump and even some left-of-center commentators mocked schiff for suggesting that trump must be removed by the senate because the 2020 election is already compromised. schiff also implied russia might invade the united states.\n\non thursday, during his closing remarks, schiff changed the argument somewhat. invoking vindman's statement that here, right matters, schiff said that trump needed to be removed because he was dangerous and trusted his personal attorney over the intelligence community.\n\nadditionally, schiff said trump could not be trusted in the event that russian hackers hypothetically attempted to publicize internal documents related to potential biden corruption.\n\nearlier in the day, democrats were laughing along as schiff joked that trump had made a religious man out of vladimir putin,'' a reference to a comment by putin last november: thank god,'' he told an economic forum in moscow, no one is accusing us of interfering in the u.s. elections anymore; now they're accusing ukraine.\n\ni was one pooped puppy. — alaska gop sen. lisa murkowski\n\nthe theory that blames ukraine for interfering in the 2016 elections is no laughing matter, schiff said, calling it central to the impeachment charges. trump is accused of seeking the ukraine investigation — and a probe of joe biden and his son hunter — for his own political benefit while holding back congressionally approved military aid as leverage.\n\nschiff warns russians could invade the u.s., says 2020 election is compromised so senators need to remove trump now\n\nthe white house and some congressional republicans have raised questions about hunter biden's lucrative job on the board of a ukrainian natural gas company, and joe biden's successful efforts to force the firing of a corrupt ukrainian prosecutor. biden was overseeing ukraine policy as vice president while hunter made big money in ukraine, and hunter got the job after testing positive for cocaine in the navy reserves.\n\nduring the house impeachment proceedings, a career state department employee testified that he had flagged hunter biden's apparent conflict of interest at the time but was told essentially not to bother the vice president's office.\n\nsen. lindsey graham, r-s.c., vowed that hunter's actions would soon play a large role in the trial.\n\ni know a lot about the trump family and their dealings in russia, graham said. i don't know anything about the biden connection. you're going to hear more about that.\n\nas senators sat through endless hours of arguments on impeachment, they found a new outlet to focus their attention: fidget spinners.\n\nsen. richard burr, r-n.c., handed out the toys to his colleagues before thursday's trial proceedings began. a fidget spinner is a small toy designed to be spun between the fingers, relieving stress or boredom.\n\ninside the chamber, restless lawmakers struggle to pay attention as senate trial drags on\n\nburr was seen playing with a blue spinner while listening to arguments by rep. jerrold nadler, d-n.y., an impeachment manager.\n\nother senators, including sen. tom cotton, r-ark., and pat toomey, r-pa., were also seen with spinners on their desks.\n\nwhile senators are pledged to silence during the trial proceedings — and deprived of their phones and other electronics — they are speaking out during breaks in the action.\n\nsenate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., meanwhile, rebutted republican senators who lamented they heard nothing new from house prosecutors. republicans voted nine times this week to block the democrats' proposed amendments for new witnesses and documents.\n\nif they want new stuff, there is plenty of it,'' schumer said at a news conference before thursday's session. as the [impeachment] managers made clear, a lot of the documents are sitting there, all compiled, all ready to go, with simply a vote of four republicans to subpoena them.''\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ndemocrats are expected to wrap up their arguments when the proceedings resume at 1 p.m. et friday, with trump's legal team set to make its case for up to three days beginning saturday. sekulow deflected rumors that the defense may wrap up in a single day.\n\nwe're going to use a sufficient amount of time to defend our case and point out the inconsistencies of their case. we're not going to run out the clock,'' he said. i am confident that whether it is [completed] saturday or monday or tuesday that the case will be made defending the president. i have no doubt.''\n\nfox news' chad pergram, marisa schultz, caroline mckee, mike emanuel, thomas firth, andrew o'reilly, jason donner, and adam shaw contributed to this report, as well as the associated press.
cap-and-trade energy tax legislation appears stalled, at least for now, in the u.s. senate. but that doesn't mean the cap-and-trade energy tax isn't imminent.\n\nsenate environment committee chairwoman barbara boxer hasn't even introduced the bill yet; new senate agriculture committee chairwoman blanche lincoln has declared the house bill dead on arrival; and there are several other cross-cutting controversies that divide democrats on the bill. the obama administration is unfazed. they are moving full steam ahead with an even more costly regulatory scheme in the name of global warming�shoehorning the regulation of greenhouse gases into the 1970 clean air act, a bill passed before anyone had ever thought of global warming and that couldn't be less suited to the task.\n\ndriving the push for this massive power grab and circumvention of the elected branches is a key white house official who avoided senate confirmation by being installed not as epa director, but instead as white house climate czar: carol browner.\n\nlong before the supreme court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, massachusetts v. epa, that the epa has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the clean air act, browner (then epa director under president bill clinton) had her general counsel, jonathan cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the epa possessed such a power. at the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that congress would never allow. now it's happening, and browner is right at the center of it.\n\nmary nichols, the chair of the california air resources board, has confirmed that browner was the lead white house negotiator in establishing new automobile emissions standards, which for the first time rely on epa's presumed authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the 1970 clean air act. nichols told the new york times that browner quietly orchestrated private discussions from the white house with auto industry officials. we put nothing in writing, ever,� nichols said.\n\nleft unchecked, browner will move beyond automobiles to epa's entire staggering 18,000-page blueprint for regulating the u.s. economy. it will eventually regulate everything that moves (light-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, buses, motorcycles, planes, trains, ships, boats, tractors, mining equipment, rvs, lawn mowers, fork lifts, and just about every other piece of equipment that has a motor) and lots of things that don't (any building over 100,000 square feet could be pulled in, along with smaller carbon dioxide emitters, like restaurants, schools, and hospitals that have commercial kitchens with gas burners).\n\nit's bad enough that the epa is moving ahead with plans to pursue expensive global warming regulations instead of leaving the complex issue to congress, the branch of government constitutionally tasked with making laws. it's made much worse by the fact that the effort is being led not by lisa jackson, the duly confirmed and therefore accountable administrator of the epa, but by carol browner, the unaccountable, unconfirmed white house climate czar.\n\nbrowner was made a czar so that her powers could be more sweeping than they would be in any single official appointment�witness her cross-agency role in the secret automobile emissions regulations�and to avoid the scrutiny of senate confirmation, which would have been difficult for browner. since leaving the clinton administration she has moved further left, even becoming one of the 14 members of the socialist international commission for a sustainable world society� on whose web site she was listed as a member as recently as january 5, the day she was named white house climate czar.\n\n\n\nthis commission pursues a clearly socialist agenda of centralized control under a regime of global governance that would enforce extreme environmental political correctness on a global basis. it's far outside the political mainstream and would have presented serious problems for centrist democrats facing a confirmation vote.\n\nit's one thing for president obama to surround himself with the advisers he'd like to have, but it's another to bestow on them sweeping powers to broker secret negotiations and push forward vast new regulations that could cost american families thousands of dollars.\n\nfortunately, we'll be able to see this week where members of the u.s. senate stand on allowing carol browner to direct taxpayer dollars and pursue vast new regulatory power grabs. sen. david vitter of louisiana has introduced an amendment (sa 2440) to the department of the interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for browner's policy directives. any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just carol browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.\n\nmr. kerpen is director of policy for americans for prosperity. he can be contacted through philkerpen.com. follow him on twitter and facebook. his free two-minute podcast is available daily.
president donald trump's national security adviser, john bolton, says the u.s. military withdrawal from northeastern syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the islamic state group, and turkey assuring the safety of kurdish fighters allied with the united states.\n\nbolton, who is in israel to reassure the u.s. ally of the trump-ordered withdrawal, says there is no timetable for the pull-out of american forces in northeastern syria, but insists it's not an unlimited commitment.\n\nbolton said on sunday that the timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement.\n\nhis comments mark the first public confirmation the drawdown has been slowed, as trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of defense secretary jim mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.

disappointing! sick! outrageous! pro-trump protesters inside the u.s. capitol must stand down at once!\n\nit's hard to express my shock and sadness at seeing america's legislative palace breached, a door to the u.s. house broken, and senators and house members hunkering down, apparently in gas masks. most astonishing is to see those involved in this violence not waving antifa flags but, instead, trump and maga banners.\n\nit's only jan. 6, but the 2021 nobel prizes for unforced errors and a suicidal leap from the moral high ground go to the pro-trump protesters marauding through the halls of the people's house.\n\ngop politicians condemn violence at capitol, call for an end to riots\n\nit would be bad enough if the acts of terrorism now being perpetrated by this mob were underway while house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., banged her gavel and shut down any objections to electoral college votes that many of my fellow trump fans believe are tainted by ballot irregularities.\n\non the contrary, 180 degrees, the house and senate were debating republican objections to arizona's electoral college votes. sen. ted cruz r-texas, was making his case to his colleagues, with his usual eloquence.\n\nrep. andy biggs, r-ariz., head of the freedom caucus, rose to state his concerns about his own state's electoral college votes. he even presented something that should not have existed: a stack of voter registrations that were recorded after the grand canyon state's statutory deadline. this is precisely the sort of evidence that the president's supporters have wanted for weeks to be aired in public.\n\nthus, the sheer mind-blowing stupidity of the buffoons who stormed the capitol. they attacked congress exactly as it was doing precisely what these people wanted done. this would be akin to antifa breaking through the windows of the capitol just as a democratic u.s. senate voted on final passage of vermont socialist sen. bernie sanders' medicare-for-all legislation.\n\ndumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb!\n\nwith guns drawn on the u.s. house floor (!), and reports of one person shot, this is the most vicious breach of the capitol since the british army attacked in 1814, during one of the most ominous moments of the war of 1812.\n\nin an astonishing act of self-sabotage, these idiots now have made it enormously difficult for those of us who admire president trump for his enormous domestic and international policy victories.\n\ninstead, any discussion of the highest median household income in american history, the lowest poverty rate ever, the complete liquidation of isis, and two covid-19 vaccines in nine months will be answered with, oh, you mean the boob whose people assaulted the u.s. capitol?\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nthese un-american anarchists have performed an enormous disservice to president trump, the america first movement, the more than 74 million voters who cast our ballots for him in november, and our beloved united states of america.\n\nthose intruders in the capitol need to back off, evacuate, go home, and ponder the evil that they did.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nthe capitol police and district of columbia metropolitan police should arrest everyone who is in violation of local and federal laws. and the suspects should be prosecuted and, if convicted, imprisoned for the maximum terms allowed by law.\n\npresident trump did the right thing wednesday afternoon. he issued a video statement from the white house via twitter and told his overzealous backers to beat it. they should heed his words at once: i know how you feel. but go home and go home in peace.\n\nclick here for more from deroy murdock
it's official. by executive fiat, president obama will grant amnesty to up to 5 million immigrants living illegally in the united states.\n\nhow did we get here? didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?\n\nif obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the fifth amendment. he is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nconsider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. a year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, actually, i don't. three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, the notion that somehow i can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.\n\nwell, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. why the metamorphosis? what changed? the law and the constitution are still the same. which leaves obama. when it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. he never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.\n\npresident obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that congress failed to act. no, mr. president, congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.\n\nthere is a difference. a determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. this is how the framers constructed our system of government. congress considers and debates a great many bills. not all of them pass. this is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. it constitutes a prudent and calculated process.\n\nbut the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. he wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. he well knows he is exceeding his power. in 2011, he said, i know some people want me to bypass congress and change the (immigration) on my own. but that's not how our system works. that's not how our democracy functions. that's not how our constitution is written. he was right. it was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.\n\nnow, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, obama is twisting the law, ignoring the constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. for years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, i'm president, i'm not king. apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. in truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.\n\nrecently, when asked why he disagreed with himself, the president insisted, well, actually, my position hasn't changed. after the laughter died down, the washington post fact checker gave obama an upside-down pinocchio for his tortured denial of a blatant flip-flop.\n\nthe president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. here are three ways this is happening:\n\n1. distorting prosecutorial discretion\n\npresident obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. it is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. useful because it can be easily abused. mr. obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. as chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.\n\nin past decisions, the u.s. supreme court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. it is subject to restrictions. the doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. it applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.\n\nby contrast, president obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. he is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. this is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. his expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. and it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.\n\nit is true that president ronald reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. but his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law congress had already passed. his exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, president george h. w. bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by congress. the point is instructive. the actions by reagan and bush are not a supporting precedent for mr. obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.\n\nhowever, president obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. it has become his political gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with congress. he contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. he treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.\n\n2. usurping legislative authority\n\nour constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. congress is vested with writing laws and the president is charged with executing those laws. this is especially true when it comes to immigration.\n\nat the end of the 19th century, the supreme court declared that congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. derived from article 1, section 8 of the constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. as the high court observed, over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of congress more complete.\n\nyet president obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. in so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. he is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.\n\n3. breaching his sworn duty\n\npresident obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. article ii, section 3 requires that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. he cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. to infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. president obama admitted as much when he said, the fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that i have to enforce. he was specifically talking about immigration laws.\n\nin 1996, congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. the statutory language is mandatory. thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. yet, the president is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. he cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. to do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.\n\nif president obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? after all, he has frequently threatened, where congress won't act, i will. what is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? or to act where congress has declined or refused to act? can he abolish certain tax laws because congress chooses to keep them? can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? if so, why even have a legislative branch of government? what's the point of a constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?\n\nmen like madison, jefferson and adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. they knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. they knew that absolute power corrupts.\n\nand they feared future presidents like mr. obama.\n\nin the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. they held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. even lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the civil war were grounded in the constitution and the rule of law.\n\nbut, like the title of his autobiography, mr. obama's measure of himself seems defined by the word audacity. it is no more evident than now.

tech giant apple may ban parler – a platform founded to promote free speech that has a large user base of trump supporters and conspiracy theorists – from its app store, which could be related to how it handled the rioting on capitol hill this week.\n\nsean davis, a co-founder for conservative outlet the federalist, wrote on twitter that apple is asking parler to engage in censorship policies or face delisting, citing two people familiar with the situation.\n\nmultiple outlets reported earlier this week that both apple and google were under pressure to remove the app, which did not take down posts threatening violence against elected officials – including vice president mike pence.\n\ntwitter permanently suspends flynn, sidney powell, says they engaged in 'harmful activity' related to qanon\n\nspokespersons for apple and parler did not return fox news' requests for comment.\n\nparler, which was founded in 2018, was built upon a foundation of respect for privacy and personal data, free speech, free markets, and ethical, transparent corporate policy.\n\nsome conservatives – like sens. ted cruz, r-texas, and rand paul, r-ky. – began turning to the platform this year after becoming frustrated with content moderation on the major platforms.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nboth facebook and twitter locked trump's account this week. while his facebook page is expected to remain locked through president-elect joe biden's inauguration, his twitter feed was suspended on friday night.\n\nmajor social media companies have come under increasing pressure – and scrutiny – for policing content on their websites, including adding fact-check labels to certain posts.\n\nsome democrats believe the companies need to do more to monitor content posted by users. former first lady michelle obama, for example, put out a statement following the raid on capitol hill this week saying that silicon valley needed to do more to prevent this type of monstrous behavior.\n\nrepublicans, on the other hand, have alleged that social media companies engage in their content moderation policies with an anti-conservative bias.
as a consumer of political content, i'm sure you've already been inundated by articles and tv segments analyzing the importance of the georgia senate run-off elections on tuesday. control of the senate means, in no uncertain terms, that president-elect joe biden and vice-president-elect kamala harris will be able to bring their agenda to life… or not.\n\nit was central to both biden's primary and general election campaigns that he was the candidate best suited to be able to work with republicans and i believe that's very much the case.\n\nhe has decades long relationships with key gop officials, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., and has shown throughout his career that he is very effective at reaching across the aisle to work on bipartisan legislation.\n\nbut for all of biden's goodwill and effort in this arena, it is obvious that republicans have no interest in working with him. biden can make all the overtures he wants, mcconnell has been clear. he sees democrats as the enemy.\n\ndonna brazile: gop senate candidates in georgia are trump puppets who act like contestants on 'the apprentice'\n\nit follows that divided government isn't good enough. in order for anything to be accomplished in washington, and i mean anything, mcconnell cannot remain in control.\n\nit's underrated and often forgotten just how sick americans are of the inaction in washington. congress enjoys an approval rating in the low teens on a good day and voters overwhelmingly believe representatives are more concerned with themselves and playing politics than what's best for americans.\n\nneed evidence? look no further than the drama over the covid-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the gop still blocked it. they can't even work together with democrats at such a dire time in history so it's quite obvious they won't be reaching across the aisle when we're out of this once in a century pandemic.\n\nthere will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the american people soon after biden's inauguration. if democratic senate candidates raphael warnock and joe ossoff are in d.c., that will be possible. if republican sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue win on tuesday, mcconnell will block that desperately needed assistance.\n\nthis is about so much more than covid assistance, though. if democrats hold a senate majority, biden should be able to make progress on key issues like the economy, health care, immigration and climate change.\n\nthese are policy areas where there is broad agreement amongst americans.\n\nnearly two thirds of americans favor increased taxes on the wealthiest americans. that includes 77% of democrats and 53% of republicans. and over two thirds support an increase in the federal minimum wage. while a majority of republicans don't support a $15 minimum wage, there is broad support for a raise beyond the current rate of $7.25.\n\nthe affordable care act currently enjoys a 53% favorability rating as compared to just 34% who oppose it in the latest kaiser family foundation polling. nearly 75% believe that it's important that people with pre-existing conditions remain protected.\n\nclick here to get the opinion newsletter\n\non immigration, americans broadly support legal status for daca kids. recent polling shows 75% hold this position. they also believe immigrants are good for the country, this includes a majority of republicans, and bring with them a strong work ethic and talent.\n\nand on climate change, nearly two-thirds of americans believe government should act more aggressively to combat climate change. they also want the government to go further to reduce greenhouse gases, restrict power plant emissions, require more fuel-efficient cars and tax corporations based on their emissions.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nthese aren't democratic positions, they are american positions. but only one party will ensure they come to life: the democrats. these are all positions and policies biden will be able to tackle if democrats also control the senate.\n\na win for warnock and ossoff is a win for american priorities.\n\nclick here to read more from jessica tarlov

'if his past statements are any indication,' then trump's speech 'will be full of malice and misinformation,' the democratic leaders said monday night in a joint statement calling for democrats to be given equal airtime. as the shutdown of roughly a quarter of the government stretched into its 18th day, both sides remained staunchly opposed to each others' proposals for a deal to fund nine federal departments.\n\n\n\nbraun, manchin try to stop congress from getting paid during shutdowns - indianapolis star: in his first act as a u.s. senator, indiana republican mike braun is expected to introduce a bipartisan bill that would prevent members of congress — including himself — from being paid during government shutdowns. currently, lawmakers are still paid when they are unable to pass spending bills by the deadline, while most federal workers are not. the latest partial government shutdown is now in its third week, as democrats and president donald trump continue to clash over border security on the country's southern border. trump has requested $5 billion for a border wall. braun's bill, co-authored by west virginia democrat joe manchin, would also prohibit retroactive pay for lawmakers.\n\n\n\ntrump changes rules to let tax refunds flow during shutdown - wsj: the internal revenue service will pay tax refunds even though the agency is subject to the federal government shutdown, after the trump administration reversed a longstanding policy. monday's decision removes one of the biggest potential pains for many americans from a prolonged shutdown. even if the impasse over a border wall lasts into the income tax-filing season scheduled to start jan. 28, the administration's move will let hundreds of billions of dollars flow to households. the administration is trying to make the shutdown as 'painless as possible consistent with the law,' russell vought, the acting director of the white house office of management and budget, told reporters. 'we're going to continue to take steps like that to mitigate the impact,' vice president mike pence said of the tax refunds.\n\n\n\npence diminished - the atlantic: according to multiple current and former administration officials, however, as trump's friction with congress has increased, pence's clout has suffered. two sources, one close to the vice president and the other close to the president, both of whom requested anonymity in order to discuss internal conversations, affirmed … that pence was leading the trump administration's negotiations on border security. yet the fact remains that this weekend, the president gave his lead negotiator very little room to negotiate, sending pence to a meeting that trump himself said would yield nothing. this, coupled with the moments over the past month when trump has publicly undermined pence's messaging, has helped create a portrait of a vice president with diminishing influence.\n\n\n\nshutdown stories: florida prison guards pay the price - nyt: a federal prison here in florida's rural panhandle lost much of its roof and fence during hurricane michael in october, forcing hundreds of inmates to relocate to a facility in yazoo city, miss., more than 400 miles away. since then, corrections officers have had to commute there to work, a seven-hour drive, for two-week stints. as of this week, thanks to the partial federal government shutdown, they will be doing it without pay — no paychecks and no reimbursement for gas, meals and laundry, expenses that can run hundreds of dollars per trip. 'you add a hurricane, and it's just too much,' said mike vinzant, a 32-year-old guard and the president of the local prison officers' union. if nature can be blamed for creating the first financial hardship, the second is the result of the even less predictable whims in washington…\n\n\n\nwilliamson: you ain't seen nothing yet - national review: this is what happens when a relatively small group of federal workers don't get their paychecks. imagine what it is going to look like when the social security checks stop coming. around 2038, less than 20 years out, total spending on the major entitlements — social security, medicare, medicaid — plus interest on the debt will exceed all federal tax revenue. put another way, come 2038, if we put every dollar uncle stupid collects in taxes toward social security, medicare, medicaid, and interest on the debt, all of that money combined will not cover those expenses. fiscal armageddon is coming.\n\n\n\nthe rulebook: crushing it\n\nthe several departments of power are distributed and blended in such a manner as at once to destroy all symmetry and beauty of form, and to expose some of the essential parts of the edifice to the danger of being crushed by the disproportionate weight of other parts. – james madison, federalist no. 47\n\n\n\ntime out: cheers\n\nsmithsonian: ['drunk history,' the comedy central show whose sixth season premieres january 15] features guests, often celebrities, telling historical tales while drinking with host derek waters and a cast re-enacting the stories as they're told, lip-synching to the narration. … waters first got the idea for 'drunk history' when his friend 'new girl' actor jake johnson drunkenly tried to tell him a story about otis redding's 1967 plane crash death. when waters told another actor friend, michael cera of 'arrested development' fame, about it, they decided to shoot an episode with cera playing alexander hamilton in a retelling of his fatal duel with aaron burr (this was, it should be noted, eight years before hamilton's off-broadway debut). the clip blew up online with the help of cera's star power, on the rise in 2007 thanks to superbad and juno; it's gotten more than 7.5 million views on youtube to date.\n\n\n\nflag on the play?

pamplona, colombia – a little girl plays with her mother's identification card – tossing, catching and guarding it fiercely. it's the only thing she has to call her own.\n\nboys nearby play soccer with an empty soda bottle. men, reduced to tears, hide away in makeshift tents, counting pennies to feed their families.\n\nit first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, todd chapman, the u.s ambassador to ecuador, told fox news. people don't leave their children behind because they want to. it is because of the dire circumstances on the ground in venezuela are causing people to take this consequential and dangerous and desperate decision to seek a better life elsewhere.\n\nthe depth of the catastrophe threatens to unravel the stability and wreak financial havoc beyond just latin america - with little end in sight. it's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to moises rendon, associate director and fellow for the center for strategic and international studies (csis).\n\nyou have a humanitarian and economic collapse, mass immigration and the government cracking down along with institutional collapse, he said. combine all these aspects together, and venezuela is fast becoming a threat for the civility of the whole region.\n\nresponse for venezuelans, the coordination platform for refugees and migrants, documents at least 16 countries that now need assistance in tending to the ever-burgeoning mass migration flow.\n\nneighboring countries have subsequently been forced to deal with spikes in crimes, sex, and drug trafficking, and criminals – both from venezuela and from home nations – seeking to take advantage of those most desperate amid the calamity.\n\nin most towns and cities across latin america, bus terminals have become sleeping hubs for new arrivals from venezuela – but often raising the ire of authorities who have been purporting to dismantle them – given they, too, have become hubs for drug dealing, crime, sexual assault, and other illicit activities.\n\nand for that reason, they are squalid, dirty and dangerous places for vulnerable venezuelans. officials refer to those leaving venezuela as being a mixed migration flow rather than refugees.\n\nalthough more than 3.3 million venezuelans are estimated to have left the country since 2015, only a small portion – for example, just 11,000 in ecuador – have applied for asylum.\n\nmany just can't feed their children so their focus is on just getting a job, anything until they can go home again, explained unhcr's representative in ecuador, maría clara martín. i have rarely seen a venezuelan who says they don't want to return.\n\nother professionals underscored the lack of information on how to apply for asylum and the needed qualifications, an issue various ngo and un bodies are endeavoring to address.\n\nsantiago chavez, ecuador's vice minister of mobility, said there are more than 300,000 venezuelans currently living in ecuador, with about three-quarters having entered in an irregular – otherwise illegal – way.\n\nthe effort that ecuador is having to do here is proportional to germany allowing a million syrian refugees in, and yet there is a big difference as germany is a big, industrial country with a lot of resources to tend to the crisis, chavez said. ecuador, in contrast, has very limited resources.\n\njobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. antonio ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of caracas and opposition leader now exiled in spain, told fox news more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.\n\nwhile fleeing to another nation provides some hope, most resort to street selling.\n\nat the resting house in quito, ecuador a group of 20-something former students and professionals take turns selling cookies in different parts of the street.\n\ni've only been able to send money home to venezuela on two occasions, lamented yondel alestre, 24, explaining that few in the shelter where he stays own a smartphone, making it difficult to contact family members. my wife is in colombia, where she had to go to give birth as there was no medical care in venezuela. my other children are with my mother in venezuela and i have to stay in ecuador to try to work.\n\nthe impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to chile or colombia, while others ventured to peru or argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.\n\nit's really rough what the migrants have gone through. everyone is frustrated, depressed, said marcelo viteli, the general manager of the resting house where up to 80 migrants are permitted to seek shelter for a few months after arrival.\n\ninside latin american 'amazing race' star's dramatic escape from venezuela\n\ntrump administration walking back obama-era foreign policy mistakes in burma\n\nit wasn't so long ago that colombians were fleeing en masse to venezuela – then the richest nation in latin america, which still holds the largest known oil reserves in the world – as a simmering 50-year civil war raged on. while the tables have abruptly turned, most colombians are eager to return the generosity.\n\nan array of colombian locals have set up their own makeshift shelters, or opened the doors to their own homes to assist the walkers on their long and arduous trek from the bordering nation.\n\nat one small hut near the border town of cucuta, some 300 mostly women and children pass through to recharge their phones, get some sleep and soup, and pick up an item of clothing from the samaritan's purse donation mound.\n\nfurther along the winding road, colombian local marta duque – who opened the home to help venezuelans after feeling a deep sense of sadness for what they were enduring – say she, too, has been threatened with fines and being arrested, given the hazard of having scores of migrants pouring out into the streets.\n\nbut she refuses to give up and shut down. i have to help because i understand what they are going through, why they have to leave, duque said.\n\none young mother, marisela, cradles her young son on duque's floor, and encourages him to take deep breaths.\n\nhe is asthmatic, and there was no help for him, no medication in venezuela, and the attacks became worse, she said. life there is chaotic in every sense. i hope to get him medicine in colombia. but without government change, there is no going home.\n\nthe acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to venezuelans, but to the region at large. the country is enduring a dire shortage of vaccinations and treatments for illnesses and diseases, prompting a concern that once eradicated conditions such as measles and diptheria are not only spreading in the financially depleted nation, but now threatens millions across latin america.\n\nthe migration in 2018 has been fast and fleeting. ecuador, for one, went from seeing the entry of thirty to forty venezuelans per month to a peak of around 90,000 in may this year. a second wave hit in october, and at least 70,000 a month have been entering since.\n\npeople who crossed before had at least a few dollars in their pocket for basic needs. now they have absolutely nothing, said victor bautista, director for development and border integration at the foreign ministry in colombia. in just six months, we went from 170 thousand migrants here to one million. sixteen months ago, we had just 32,000. something must be done. the humanitarian issues are unbelievable, and they will hurt the entire region.\n\nboth government and non-governmental professionals tending to the regional calamity concurred that this year there has been a profile shift in those fleeing.\n\nin the first few years of the meltdown, which gained momentum in 2015, those with some finances and education were able to buy plane tickets out. but as the situation has slowly deteriorated, those from poorer backgrounds started to escape.\n\none u.s government official closely monitoring the case told fox news that while official displacement camps have not yet been established, calling this a last resort it is an option on the table being considered.\n\nexperts surmise that at least one in 10 leaving venezuela now are disabled, and have pointed to an uptick in unaccompanied minors crossing international borders – mostly boys between the ages of 15 and 17. but many don't have documentation.\n\nultimately, the buck stops with local governments who are then in-charge of tending to the minors, with local aid agencies doing their best to offer guidance and support to the already overwhelmed government bodies.\n\nbut with mass migration, comes surges in what some deem xenophobia toward venezuelans, what others claim to be integration problems, and what others characterize as one citizen's need to put their own families first, over that of legal and illegal arrivals.\n\nwe are trying to establish programs that can be of benefit to both ecuadorians and venezuelans, and address the welfare concerns of both, said the international organization for migration (iom) ecuador's chief of mission, manuel hoff.\n\nin several soup kitchens and shelters, separate lines and dining areas have had to be set up separate the poor locals from the venezuelans, as to avoid any contention.\n\nyet the end game is unclear. all signs point to the situation only worsening, especially after january 10, when maduro begins another presidential term. though his term is not recognized by most of the international community, which viewed the 2017 presidential election as a farce.\n\nso maduro will after jan. 9 be deemed illegitimate in the eyes of most international players – including the united states – which has been mulling designating venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism alongside iran, north korea, syria, and sudan.\n\nyet venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of cuba, iran, china, russia and turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. turkish president tayyip erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against venezuela, and this year turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from venezuela. and russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.\n\nthe maduro regime has – for the most part – denied the existence of a major crisis in its country, instead blaming the us- and us-supported political foe for waging economic war.\n\nover the past fiscal year, the united states has already given almost $100 million – distributed through the department of state and other agencies – to assist in the humanitarian response to the regional venezuela contingency. in september, the u.s. pledged a further $48 million. moreover, the department of defense spending in the region over the past year totaled more than $110 million.\n\nthe number of venezuelans fleeing is expected to reach 5.3 million by the end of 2019, according to the united nations, in what has become the largest exodus in modern latin american history.\n\nthe u.n high commissioner for refugees stated that humanitarian organizations will require $738 million to provide vital services such as food and shelters to help ease the burden on receiving nations.\n\nit is forecasted that colombia will continue to receive the most migrants, at least another 1.2 million over the coming year totaling 2.2 million, while its expected peru will have 1.4 million venezuelans by the end of 2019. ecuador, brazil, as well as other countries in the southern cone, central america and the caribbean too are predicted to see a swell in venezuelan arrivals.\n\nthe un is projecting that at least two million more venezuelans will flee their crumbling country over the course of the year.\n\nnonetheless, chapman, the american ambassador in ecuador, underscored the u.s is committed to the cause, and said the trump administration has long been resolute in supporting the humanitarian response in the region.\n\nwhat has been shocking to me is i am seeing parallels to other places i have worked – afghanistan and mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. people have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. it is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the venezuela crisis all the more important.
overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, house democrats on thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees.\n\nalthough planned portions of the rules relating to the house's handling of obamacare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of new york democratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez's opposition to the measure.\n\nthree republicans supported the democrats' rules, including pennsylvania rep. brian fitzpatrick, and new york reps. john katko and tom reed. in addition to ocasio-cortez, hawaii democratic rep. tulsi gabbard and california rep. ro khanna voted against the rules package.\n\non wednesday, ocasio-cortez vowed to join khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by house speaker nancy pelosi. that rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.\n\nthe pay-go principle, ocasio-cortez charged in a tweet wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\n\nwe shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added. but, pelosi deputy chief of staff drew hammill fired back, tweeting: a vote against the democratic rules package is a vote to let [director of the office of management and budget (omb)] mick mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing democratic initiatives and funding increases.\n\npay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nother rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through september 30 of the budget year once the house adopts a budget. the so-called gephardt rule had offered the house much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the house and senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.\n\nthe rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. the select committee on the climate crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when democrats last controlled the house. but, the house rules give the panel until march 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.\n\nand, although hats have been barred in the house chamber for more than a century, a new house rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear. that means the rules will still preclude democratic florida rep. frederica wilson from wearing her signature cowboy hats on the house floor -- but democratic minnesota rep. ilhan omar, a muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.\n\nadditional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held.\n\nportions of the rules had also provided that the house has the authority to defend obamacare, which was recently ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, in court.\n\ndem introducing impeachment articles against trump on first day of new congress\n\nmeanwhile, house democrats thursday night debated a combined spending bill to end part of the government shutdown.\n\nthe house late thursday ultimately passed a bill to fund the department of homeland security until feb.8, by a 239 to 192 vote. but the bill does not include any new wall money, and senate republicans and the white house have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. five republicans voted for the bill.\n\nanother piece of legislation proposed and debated by democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through sept. 30. that bill, which the white house has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. et, with seven republicans joining democrats to vote yea. the measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.\n\nin a news conference thursday night, pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial shutdown, which has dragged on since dec. 22 amid demands from the white house that any federal spending bill include funding for a wall on the southern border.\n\nhowever, pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it.\n\nwe sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told reporters. the president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. and we will do that. and we will have a discussion. pelosi then interjected to remind hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. et, and joked that trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.\n\ntrump met with pelosi and other senior democrats at a contentious meeting on wednesday in the white house situation room, which included senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., interrupting homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen within five seconds, according to republicans at the meeting. the sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new congress was seated thursday.\n\nthe message is very simple: this is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, new york democratic rep. nita lowey, who chairs the house appropriations committee, said afterward.\n\nwatch: trump holds surprise press conference with border patrol union\n\nshortly after pelosi's historic return to the house speakership, trump made his first-ever appearance in the white house briefing room to congratulate pelosi and reaffirm his commitment to the border wall.\n\ntogether with officials from the national border patrol council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, trump insisted that we need protection in our country.\n\ni promise you, if you interview border patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, brandon judd, the president of the border patrol union, told the media after trump's introductory remarks. i worked in naco, ariz., for ten years. we didn't have physical barriers in naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. we built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... we need those physical barriers and we appreciate president trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.\n\ntrump himself likely will soon deliver that message in person to congressional democrats. in a show of normalcy towards the end of a whirlwind day of history and drama on capitol hill, pelosi on thursday evening formally invited trump to deliver state of the union speech in congress on jan. 29.\n\nfox news' chad

japan on friday reported 41 new cases of a virus on a quarantined cruise ship and turned away another luxury liner while the death toll in mainland china rose to 636, including a doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the disease threat.\n\nfollowing an online uproar over the government's treatment of dr. li wenliang, 34, the ruling communist party said it was sending an investigation team to fully investigate relevant issues raised by the public regarding the case.\n\nget fox business on the go by clicking here\n\ntwo docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in hong kong and japan.\n\nbefore friday's 41 confirmed cases, 20 infected passengers were escorted off the diamond princess at yokohama near tokyo. about 3,700 people have been confined aboard the ship.\n\nprime minister shinzo abe announced thursday that japan will deny entry of foreign passengers on another cruise ship — holland america's cruise ship westerdam, on its way to okinawa from hong kong — because of suspected virus patients found on board. the seattle-based operator denied anyone had virus.\n\nchina's coronavirus outbreak kills 638, infects more than 31,400 as world struggles for a cure\n\nabe said the new immigration policy takes effect friday to ensure border control to prevent the disease from entering and spreading further into japan.\n\nthe ship with more than 2,000 people was currently near ishigaki, one of okinawa's outer islands, and was seeking another port, said overseas travel agency official mie matsubara.\n\neveryone is starting to reject the ship and we are getting desperate, she said. we hope we can go somewhere so that passengers can land.\n\nat least four other cruise ships, two foreign and two japanese-operated, are headed to japan by the end of the month, transport minister kazuyoshi akaba said, urging port authorities around the country to turn them away.\n\ndr. li had worked at a hospital in the epicenter of the outbreak in the central city of wuhan. he was one of eight medical professionals in wuhan who tried to warn colleagues and others when the government did not, writing on his twitter-like weibo account that on dec. 3 he saw a test sample that indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to sars, which killed nearly 800 people in a 2002-2003 outbreak that the government initially tried to cover-up.\n\ntrump speaks to china's xi on phone about coronavirus and trade\n\nli wrote that after he reported seven patients had contracted the virus, he was visited on jan. 3 by police, who forced him to sign a statement admitting to having spread falsehoods and warning him of punishment if he continued.\n\na copy of the statement signed by li and posted online accused him of making false statements and seriously disturbing social order.\n\nthis is a type of illegal behavior! the statement said.\n\nli wrote that he developed a cough on jan. 10, fever on jan. 11 and was hospitalized on jan. 12, after which he began having trouble breathing.\n\nhe also wrote that he had not in fact had his medical license revoked, a reference to the sort of extrajudicial retaliation the communist authorities meet out to rights lawyers and others seen as troublemakers.\n\nplease rest easy, i will most certainly actively cooperate with the treatment and seek to obtain an early discharge! li wrote on jan. 31. he posted again on feb. 1, saying he had been confirmed as having the virus.\n\non friday, the global times, a communist party newspaper and usual staunch defender of the authorities, reported that many said the experience of the eight 'whistleblowers' was evidence of local authorities' incompetence to tackle a contagious and deadly virus.\n\nit quoted zeng guang, chief epidemiologist at the chinese center for disease control and prevention, as telling the paper's editor that we should highly praise the eight wuhan residents.\n\nthey were wise before the outbreak, zeng was quoted as saying. the paper also cited online voices saying local authorities owe li an apology. it quoted one posting as saying, we lost a hero. if his warning could send an alarm, the outbreak might not have continued to worsen, the posting said.\n\nlooking back, his professional sense of vigilance in particular is worthy of our respect, the paper said in an editorial.\n\nthe police action against the eight whistleblowers also garnered a rare and extremely subtle rebuke from the nation's highest court. we have the responsibility to express to society our legal thoughts about solving the problem of rumors, a posting on the court's weibo account said.\n\nmeanwhile, a newborn discovered infected 36 hours after birth has become the youngest known patient. doctors said other infected mothers have given birth to babies who tested negative, so it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted in the womb.\n\nchina's state media said friday that president xi jinping urged the u.s. to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak in a phone call with president donald trump.\n\na people's war against the virus has been launched, xi was quoted as saying by broadcaster cctv, using timeworn communist terminology. we hope the u.s. side can assess the epidemic in a calm manner and adopt and adjust its response measures in a reasonable way.\n\nbeijing has complained that the u.s. was flying its citizens out of wuhan but not providing any assistance to china.\n\nthe white house said trump expressed confidence in china's strength and resilience in confronting the challenge of the outbreak.\n\nwuhan has built two new prefabricated hospitals in recent weeks and is adapting gymnasiums, exhibition centers and other spaces for patients were milder symptoms. thousands of additional military and civilian medical workers have been sent to the city.\n\nstill, those inside that quarantine area encompassing a population of around 50 million speak of a medical system completely overwhelmed.\n\nchen jiaxin, 22, told the associated press by phone from wuhan that his father fell ill on jan. 28 but had to return home because no hospital would accept him. when he called for an ambulance after his father's fever spiked on thursday morning, chen said he was told 400 people were waiting ahead of him.\n\nwe were just told to wait and wait, chen said.\n\nclick here to read more on fox business\n\ntesting of a new antiviral drug was set to begin on a group of patients thursday, the official xinhua news agency reported. the drug, remdesivir, is made by u.s. biotech company gilead sciences.\n\nwith the development of a vaccine months, or years, away, researchers are experimenting with the re-purposing of existing drugs used to treat viruses such as hiv.
democratic leaders are doubling down on accusations that president trump's description of a crisis at the u.s.-mexico border is manufactured, as the president prepares to visit the front-lines on the heels of his oval office address to the nation.\n\nthe response to the speech underscores how increasingly polarized the debate has become and how little progress is being made toward a resolution to the standoff that triggered a partial government shutdown nearly three weeks ago.\n\ntrump plans to meet with congressional leaders once again in the situation room wednesday afternoon, ahead of his planned trip to the southern texas border on thursday. but past meetings have resulted in both sides digging in, with trump insisting on nearly $6 billion for a border wall and democrats saying they won't entertain the discussion until congress passes and trump signs a package re-opening shuttered federal agencies.\n\ntuesday night's primetime address saw both camps drifting even further apart, with trump declaring a humanitarian and security crisis and vowing to protect america, so help me god – and democratic congressional leaders saying trump is working to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\n\ndems accuse trump of 'malice' after border speech\n\nspeaking wednesday on fox news' america's newsroom, democratic national committee chairman tom perez echoed senate minority leader chuck schumer's language.\n\nthis whole border security crisis … it really, i believe, is a manufactured crisis, he said, adding that it's distracting from issues like health care and education.\n\nthe fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat; they are a humanitarian challenge, house speaker nancy pelosi said in the joint democratic rebuttal alongside schumer.\n\ntrump and his allies say democrats, many of whom supported border security measures in the past, are only bucking the calls now because of knee-jerk opposition to his administration.\n\nbut perez maintained that democrats believe in meaningful border security, and also believe a wall is not smart policy.\n\ntrump declares crisis at border\n\nhow the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear. the mounting impact of the partial shutdown, which initially was limited but will increase as more federal workers miss paychecks this cycle and services like those at national parks suffer, is likely to increase pressure on congress and the white house to forge a deal in the coming days.\n\nyet trump told congressional leaders the standoff could last months, even years, as he demands washington take action to stem the flow of illegal immigrants, drugs and criminals crossing the border.\n\non tuesday, trump underscored cases of americans killed allegedly by illegal immigrants, including california police cpl. ronil singh, who was murdered the day after christmas -- allegedly by an illegal immigrant suspected of driving drunk. the suspect had multiple prior arrests, and republicans have charged that california's sanctuary laws -- which prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities -- led to singh's murder.\n\namerica's heart broke the day after christmas when a young police officer in california was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border, trump said. the life of an american hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\n\nhe asked, how much more american blood must be shed before congress does its job?\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\npelosi responded: president trump must stop holding the american people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.\n\nfox news' gregg re and samuel chamberlain contributed to this report.

a u.s. judge on friday blocked the trump administration's most sweeping set of asylum restrictions less than two weeks before president-elect joe biden takes office.\n\nthe rules had been set to take effect monday. the court order has limited immediate impact because the government has largely suspended asylum at the u.s.-mexico border during the coronavirus pandemic, citing public health concerns.\n\nstill, letting the rules take effect would have been felt by some who can still claim asylum and make it significantly more difficult for all asylum-seekers once pandemic-related measures are lifted.\n\npresident trump's administration argued that the measures were an appropriate response to a system rife with abuse and overwhelmed with unworthy claims.\n\ntrump extends restrictions on work visas, says pandemic still disrupts 'american livelihoods'\n\nthey sought to redefine how people qualify for asylum and similar forms of humanitarian protection if they face persecution at home. the restrictions would have broadened the grounds for a judge to deem asylum applications frivolous and prohibit applicants from ever winning protections in the u.s.\n\nu.s. district judge james donato in san francisco sided with advocacy groups who sued, saying acting homeland security secretary chad wolf lacked authority to impose the sweeping rules.\n\ndonato, who was appointed to the bench in 2013 by president barack obama, wrote that wolf's appointment violated an established order of succession. he said it was the fifth time a court has ruled against homeland security on the same grounds.\n\nthe government has recycled exactly the same legal and factual claims made in the prior cases, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts, donato wrote. this is a troubling litigation strategy. in effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through.\n\nmexico seeks help to get covid-19 vaccines for migrants in us\n\ndonato said his ruling applies nationwide because limiting its reach would result in a fragmented and disjointed patchwork of immigration policy.\n\nit was not immediately clear if the trump administration would make an emergency appeal. the justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late friday.\n\naaron frankel, an attorney for plaintiffs, has called the rules nothing less than an attempt to end the asylum system.\n\nasylum is a legal protection designed for people fleeing persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership to a social group. any foreigner who steps on u.s. soil has a legal right to apply for asylum, according to u.s. asylum law and international treaty obligations.\n\nthe rules would narrow the types of persecution and severity of threats for which asylum is granted. applicants seeking protections on the basis of gender or those who claim they were targeted by gangs, rogue government officials or non-state organizations would likely not be eligible for asylum.\n\nimmigration judges would be directed to be more selective about granting asylum claims and allow them to deny most applications without a court hearing.\n\nas border numbers increase, cbp chief says us faces 'full-blown crisis' if trump-era policies end\n\nthey also would have weighed several new factors against an applicant's ability to win protections, among them failure to pay taxes. criminal records would still count against an asylum-seeker even if their convictions were expunged.\n\nunder pandemic-related measures in effect since march, about nine in every 10 people stopped at the border are immediately expelled on public health grounds. the rest are processed under immigration laws, which include the right to seek asylum.\n\ndonato took issue with how people came to lead the department of homeland security. wolf became acting secretary in november 2019, replacing kevin mcaleenan, who was also in an acting role. courts have ruled that wolf improperly leapfrogged to the top job from his position as undersecretary for strategy, policy and plans.\n\ndonato, like other judges, said mcaleenan, who had been customs and border protection commissioner, also was promoted to the top homeland security job out of order, making his handover to wolf have no legal effect whatsoever.\n\nhomeland security has been without a senate-confirmed secretary since kirstjen nielsen resigned in april 2019.\n\nwhile the trump administration faced a legal setback, it's already instituted a raft of policies restricting asylum, including making asylum-seekers wait in mexico while their claims are heard in u.s. court.\n\nbiden is expected to reverse some of trump's restrictive asylum measures, including the remain in mexico policy, but recently said his administration would need probably the next six months to re-create a system that can process asylum-seekers to prevent a flood of migrants arriving at the southern border.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nalso friday, the 4th u.s. circuit court of appeals in richmond, virginia, ruled against the administration's policy that gave state and local governments the right to refuse to resettle refugees.\n\nthe three-judge panel said trump's executive order that required both state and local entities to give their consent before allowing refugees to be placed in their areas would undermine the 1980 refugee act. that law set by congress was designed to allow resettlement agencies to find the best place for a person to thrive while working with local and state officials.
