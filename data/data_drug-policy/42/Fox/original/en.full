QAnon followers have appeared at Trump's rallies wearing clothes and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Twitter, permanently suspended the @realDonaldTrump account on Friday, following months of flagging his tweets with warnings -- and days after the company said he violated its policies.\\n\\nThe platform locked Trump out of his account for the first time this week. The social media company deemed a number of tweets connected to the violent protests at the Capitol on Wednesday as inflammatory.\\n\\nAfter close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence, the company wrote in a blog post.\\n\\nLater, when the president shared three messages from the official @POTUS handle, Twitter quickly took them down. He sent the same text out in a statement to White House reporters, criticizing Twitter as an opponent of free speech and teasing a potential new conservative social media platform in the future.\\n\\nThe official account had, until that point, not shared any tweets since late December. It will be transferred to President-elect Joe Biden after Inauguration Day and remains active.\\n\\nThe president's account was suspended Wednesday night after he posted a video with a message for protesters who had stormed the Capitol earlier. After violence that led to multiple deaths, Trump told them to go home, but maintained that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.\\n\\nTwitter removed the president's video before suspending his account and warning that further violations of the platform's policies could result in a permanent suspension.\\n\\nSharing two tweets from the president Friday, including one in which he said he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, the company argued that they had to be viewed in part of a greater context.\\n\\nThe other read: The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\\n\\nThe mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election, Twitter said in a statement.\\n\\nThe blog post claimed plans for future armed protests over the election results already were being shared both on and off the platform -- including a proposed secondary attack on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nThese two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President's statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks, the company said. After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service.\\n\\nFor years, the president has used Twitter to communicate directly to the American people -- bypassing the media and other gatekeepers of information. But some of his more fiery tweets have drawn criticism, sometimes from his own party.\\n\\nTwitter confirmed in early December that special privileges granted to world leaders are rescinded once they leave office.

{"original": "The congressional endeavor of certifying the presidential winner in the Electoral College is typically a banal ritual.\\n\\nBut on Wednesday after weeks of mounting emotions, lawsuits to overturn the results, and an insistence from President Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen, the ceremonial duty became a jaw-dropping event pockmarked by a raid of the Capitol, shots ringing out, tear gas and lives lost.\\n\\nSo what happened?\\n\\nAccording to one U.S. military veteran heavily involved in the planning of Wednesday's protests, attendees came from across the country.\\n\\nWhether it was Veterans for Trump or Bikers for Trump or Latinos for Trump, we were all there together. We came together by action and the call of our president, the source, who spoke on background, told Fox News. Our commander-in-chief had requested our assistance, and any veteran with honor listens to the commander-in-chief. That is the spirit in which we live.\\n\\nIn the days leading up to Wednesday, Trump supporters started pouring in, the source said.\\n\\nEverything was booked; you couldn't get a room. People were camping out in the cold, the organizer said, explaining that buses brought supporters from out-of-state. It was a call to action. We knew this was going to be a big day and an important point in time.\\n\\nNEW FBI WANTED POSTERS IN CAPITOL RIOT MANHUNT\\n\\nJan. 6, the date for certification of the Electoral College, began with small crowds of Trump supporters filtering into designated areas around the Ellipse for permit-approved rallies.\\n\\nAround 10 a.m., in bone-chilling cold, Trump's sons and his longtime lawyer spoke to the growing crowds, and after the president's speech, in which he said he would never concede, thousands marched toward the Capitol after he suggested that they should.\\n\\nWe're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women, Trump said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, many more protesters accumulated by the White House lawn.\\n\\nBut shortly after 1 p.m., demonstrators started clashing with law enforcement on the steps of the Capitol. Less than 30 minutes later, representatives inside the building were being evacuated amid reports of a bomb outside. And at about 2:10 p.m., rioters managed to blow past police lines and scale the walls around the building.\\n\\nBLM ACTIVIST INSIDE CAPITOL CLAIMS HE WAS 'DOCUMENTING' RIOTS, ONCE SAID 'BURN IT ALL DOWN'\\n\\nWithin another 40 minutes, the barricades ruptured and thousands headed into the chambers with anger, exhilaration, determination and confusion. After the initial scuffle and breach, word spread quickly through social media forums and scores followed each others' footsteps inside.\\n\\nFrom the one insider's point-of-view, the doors were already open to them, and the barricades had been pulled down already. People simply wanted to be heard in the chambers, they wanted their voices heard, and were sick and tired of what had been going on.\\n\\nTrump eventually urged backers to protest peacefully and patriotically, but the chaos continued.\\n\\nBut whether or not detailed plans to overrun the federal building had been set in motion earlier was subject to debate. One Washington security employee connected to the White House told Fox News that it's likely 95% of the attendees were there to protest non-violently. Still, there was likely a sub-section of attendees with more violent intentions.\\n\\nMany of the attackers appeared dressed for a riot – suggesting some element of planning, said Jordan Strauss, managing director of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a division of New York-based risk consultancy Duff & Phelps. But I suspect that it was a combination, with some individuals having announced themselves as having come to storm the Capitol or incite some sort of revolution. It would surprise me if some otherwise peaceful protesters were not swept up in the fever of the moment and decided to cross the threshold from peaceful protesters to criminals on the spot.\\n\\nNonetheless, the drawing in of MAGA devotees and Trump loyalists for the coveted date had long been in the works, mostly through Facebook pages and online groups – many of which are above-board, registered non-profit 501c3s.\\n\\nAccording to a number of those who attended Wednesday's events, the big push began after Trump tweeted on Dec. 19: Big protest in D.C. on January 6. Be there, be wild!\\n\\nFlyers, pinpointing three locations to meet, quickly appeared under the headline Trump Wants to See You in D.C. Open-source discussions about flight costs and places to stay grew. Some prepared to bring bulletproof clothing and weapons for protection, expressing concern over countering Antifa activists.\\n\\nThere's often little sophistication to how these events are planned, said Ryan Schonfeld, founder & CEO, RAS Security Group. The ability to respond in a coordinated manner is possible with the right combination of people and technology making sense of the available data. An exacerbating factor is misinformation, often spread through the use of fake social media and online accounts and profiles.\\n\\nMomentum, augmented heavily by Trump's rhetoric, continued to gather as the reckoning day to stop the steal neared. Several already well-established contingencies supporting the president continued to encourage backers to show up, and new Facebook groups echoing the rallying cry surfaced. While less-regulated social media sites such as Gab and Parler have become common platforms for protest discussions, several of those involved told Fox News that most communication was not underground or via encryption, but open-source.\\n\\nWe augment and push out our events through social media messaging, and we have direct coordinators and influencers (with large followings) who help in letting our supporters know event times and locations, the source continued. The point was to be there for the president. All of these patriot groups wanted to be there. We don't want to see the theft of America or a banana republic.\\n\\nLast Friday, the first day of 2021, after a surprise early departure from his Florida's Mar-a-Lago residence before ringing in the New Year with his most ardent donors, Trump tweeted that the BIG Protest Rally would begin at 11 a.m. on Jan. 6.\\n\\nThe rally was set against a backdrop of failed lawsuits advocated by Lin Wood, Sidney Powell and others to overturn Joe Biden's November victory. And Trump supporters' hopes that he would remain in the White House were revived by the Jan. 2 declaration by 12 Republican senators including Josh Hawley of Missouri and Texas' Ted Cruz to lodge objections to the Electoral College certification.\\n\\nTRUMP SAYS HE 'WILL NOT BE GOING' TO BIDEN'S INAUGURATION\\n\\nBut how and why the Capitol was so easily breached remains a sore point many security experts are piecing together. Officials have contended that despite weeks of planning between federal and local law enforcement agencies, which also entailed social media monitoring, there was no intelligence to indicate the historic chaos.\\n\\nThe lack of intel line sparked further conspiracies by those at the rally.\\n\\nSome involved in Wednesday's breach still maintain that it was never their intention -- and rather, that anti-Trump agitators initiated it.\\n\\nAnother pro-Trump activist vowed that there were different anarchists involved, some of whom took advantage of trying to get patriotic, emotionally charged people to do something stupid -- like following the leader into the Capitol.\\n\\nNonetheless, the whole episode shook the Washington security apparatus to the core.\\n\\nAs Chris Edwards, director of Tax Policy Studies at the libertarian-leaning CATO Institute, said it would be hard for the Capitol Police to complain about underfunding.\\n\\nThe force has 2,300 officers and a $516 million budget to defend two square miles, Edwards said.\\n\\nSpending on the police force increased from $115 million in 2000 to an estimated $516 million for 2021, he said.\\n\\nThat equals an annual average growth rate of 7.4 percent, much faster than the 2.1 percent average annual inflation over the period, Edwards said. The Capitol Police budget is more than the police budgets of Atlanta and Detroit.\\n\\nIn the end, at least five people -- including a police officer defending the Capitol, and military veteran and Trump adherent Ashli Babbitt, who was shot as she entered through a window -- died. So far, police have made more than 68 arrests, 41 of them on Capitol turf and only one identified as Washington resident, authorities have said.\\n\\nAnd yet, for many Americans who still stand by the unfounded notion of a fraudulent 2020 election, in the aftermath of Wednesday's bloodshed and with Biden's inauguration just 12 days away, they are still firmly committed to the pro-Trump cause.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOne on-the-ground, pro-Trump leader who is in the process of gathering video and content to dispel the false narratives that (they) are the terrorists or insurgents.\\n\\nPeople were being funneled into one direction; how do we know it wasn't a deliberate tactic to target us? the supporter said. An unarmed combat veteran was shot. Police could have easily used a non-lethal tactic. We will always honor our fallen, and we are not going to go away. We want to follow our commander-in-chief, and we are watching and waiting for his next action."}
{"original": "A top U.S. State Department official came out swinging Sunday against the Islamic Republic of Iran's plan to execute another wrestler, after Tehran's rulers publicly hanged the champion wrestler Navid Afkari in September on widely criticized, trumped-up charges.\\n\\nThe Iranian regime must be held to account for their vile human rights abuses and their attempt to cling to power through execution, Ellie Cohanim, the State Department's deputy special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism, told Fox News.\\n\\nThe execution of the decorated wrestler Mehdi Ali Hosseini is imminent. He is from Andimeshk in the province of Khuzestan, and was arrested in 2015 and charged with pre-meditated murder, supposedly committed during a group brawl. It is unclear whether Iran's regime forced Hosseini to confess to a crime he did not commit.\\n\\nA NEW FRONT AGAINT IRAN FOR 2021\\n\\nIran's opaque judiciary and penal system repeatedly tortured Afkari into admitting a killing he did not carry out, according to human rights organizations and Western governments. The clerical rulers hanged Afkari for protesting in 2018 against the economic and political corruption of the regime controlled by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.\\n\\nWhat the European Union needs to ask themselves is, at what point do you consider a state a bad actor and take action accordingly, said Cohanim, who fled the Islamic Republic of Iran with her family in 1979, when she was 6, to escape its repressive state policies. Is it when the state underwrites terrorism and causes instability in entire regions? Is it when the state starves its own people while enriching its leadership? Is it when the state commits mass human rights violations against its own citizens?

After murdering champion wrestler Navid Afkari, the criminal regime occupying Iran intends to put fellow wrestler Mehdi Ali Hosseini to death.\\n\\nKhansarinia continued, The International Olympic Committee has as yet refused to take any serious actions against the regime in Tehran for its bloody assault against athletes, despite a coordinated campaign by Iranian athletic champions.\\n\\nFox News sent multiple press queries to the IOC and United World Wrestling (UWW). No response was received by press time.\\n\\nElite Iranian wrestlers have urged that Hosseini not be executed.\\n\\nHamid Sourian, a Greco-Roman wrestler who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics, said, I beg Dr. Gholami Gheibi, who is one of the prominent doctors in Dezful, [in Khuzestan Province], as the father of the victim, to please God rescind the death penalty.\\n\\nSourian, who is vice president of the Iranian Wrestling Federation, added, I hope that the honorable Gheibi family will forgive this young man by doing this good deed.\\n\\nIRAN WARNS OF TRUMP OF 'REVENGE', IRAQ ISSUES ARREST WARRANT FOR PRESIDENT IN SOLEIMANI KILLING\\n\\nFox News sent numerous press queries to Iran's foreign ministry and its permanent mission to the U.N.\\n\\nThe regime should be banned from all Olympic and international sports activities until it stops murdering athletes and lifts its gender apartheid laws toward female athletes and fans, Khansarinia said.\\n\\nThe disregard for the lives of Iranians shown by international organizations including the IOC has removed any and all of their legitimacy as humanitarian bodies, Khansarinia added.\\n\\nThe United for Navid campaign was launched by Masih Alinejad, a women's rights activist and founder of the My Stealthy Freedom effort.\\n\\nHer campaign tweeted: We are stay[ing] behind you to save the life of #mehdi_ali_hosseini. #NavidAfkari was tortured and murdered few months ago.

That's his business.\\n\\nBut he emphasized, you're not going to see any financial support from Washington or from the business community or any Republican who is not associated with the fringe, that is going to be supportive of those things.\\n\\nAfter Trump supporters breached the Capitol, forcing the building into lockdown and suspending for six hours the House and Senate election certification sessions, the president did urge them to leave in a peaceful manner, but he never condemned their actions and repeated his unfounded claims that he won the election in a landslide.\\n\\nThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, Trump wrote in a message that was later deleted by Twitter. He added, Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\\n\\nTRUMP DELETES TWEETS THAT SENT HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT INTO LOCKDOWN\\n\\nTrump, who's spent the past two months claiming the presidential election was rigged and rampant with massive fraud and who's refused to concede to Biden, on Wednesday night finally acknowledged he would be departing the White House later this month.\\n\\nEven though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th, the president said in a statement posted to Twitter by his social media director. Trump's own account was locked by Twitter for posting tweets earlier in the day that the company claimed appeared to justify the assault on the Capitol.\\n\\nIt came just hours after the Democrats narrowly won both Senate runoff elections in Georgia, which gives them a razor-thin majority in the chamber to go along with their slight majority in the House of Representatives. And with Biden just two weeks away from being inaugurated as president, the Democrats will control both the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.\\n\\nTrump is facing blame by some in the party for the GOP losses in Georgia, due to his repeated claims that his narrow defeat in the state to Biden was due to fraud, and for his numerous vocal attacks on Georgia's Republican governor and secretary of state for refusing to aid his attempts to upend the state's election results.\\n\\nA Georgia based GOP consultant told Fox News that when the dust settles on both of these races and anybody's doing a realistic analysis on why Republicans lost, it has to include the president and his behavior towards the governor and the secretary of state and his decision to essentially go scorched earth because he ended up losing the state by a narrow margin in the president election.\\n\\nThe consultant, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, added that it was very problematic for our candidates. Any private conversations on why they lost is going to start with President Trump's actions over the past nine weeks.\\n\\nTRUMP LASHES OUT AT FELLOW REPUBLICANS FOR FAILING TO SUPPORT HIS ELECTION CHALLENGE\\n\\nThe president, at Wednesday's rally, called such GOP officials weak Republicans and he told his supporters that we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.\\n\\nThe comments by Trump – who's already said he'll target a handful of Republicans when they're up for re-election in 2022 – was his most explosive language to date – and it appears be sparking a serious divide in the GOP, which could have major implications in the next midterm elections, when the Republicans will try to recapture both houses of Congress and expand their control of the governorships.\\n\\nTop Trump political adviser Corey Lewandowski told Fox News that the president has raised northwards of a quarter of a billion dollars since Election Day for his campaign and that will give him the opportunity to target individuals who don't support the Make America Great Again agenda in 2022, and that includes Republicans.\\n\\nYou've got someone who is unbelievably popular, who has enormous amounts of cash on hand, and has the opportunity and desire to weigh in and hold people accountable for both their statements and their records, he added.\\n\\nTrump's hopes to play a kingmaker role in 2022 comes as he's also flirting with a 2024 presidential bid to try and reclaim the White House.\\n\\nIS TRUMP THE CLEAR FRONTRUNNER IN THE 2024 GOP WHITE HOUSE RACE?\\n\\nWhile the president's approval rating among Republicans has stayed in the stratosphere -- it stood at 86% in a Fox News national poll and at 90% in an NPR/PBS/Marist survey, which were both conducted in early December, and nine out of 10 Republicans gave him a thumbs up in a USA Today/Suffolk University national poll conducted two weeks ago – this week's events appear to be taking a toll.\\n\\nSen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a strong Trump supporter who crisscrossed the 2020 campaign trail on behalf of the president – and who may have national ambitions of his own in 2024– said late Wednesday in a statement that it's past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence.\\n\\nDan Eberhart, a major GOP donor and bundler who helped raise money for the president, told Fox News that this is a failure of leadership. If President Trump wants to have any kind of political future within the Republican Party, he needs to condemn the violence at the Capitol and stop claiming the election was stolen.\\n\\nThe desecration of the Capitol is not going to be forgotten, Eberhart emphasized. He cost Senate Majority Leader (Mitch) McConnell his leadership position and now he's shitting all over the Capitol – I think that's a pretty strong statement about how President Trump feels about the Republican Party.\\n\\nTamasi also spotlighted the erosion of Trump's support within the party.\\n\\nAs it relates to Washington establishment, which was not entirely supportive, that's gone. As well as the business community, as well as a lot of Republicans who supported the president because he was the head of the party and he was advancing policy priorities that were aligned with the party, he said.\\n\\nAnd pointing to Trump, as well as possible 2024 GOP presidential contenders Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, who were the Senate Republicans leaders in aiding the president's objections to the Electoral College vote, Tamasi predicted that they are rapidly sinking ships in the Republican Party as we look at 2024.\\n\\nWhile Trump's ban on Twitter was temporary, Facebook on Thursday announced it will block the president on its platforms, which includes Instagram, at least until the end of his term on Jan. 20.\\n\\nCarney, a top political adviser to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said the potential long-term lockout from his social media platforms would be a huge crushing blow to his prospects to being a kingmaker in the future because those are his go-to platforms…It will be difficult to be much of an influencer without those platforms.\\n\\nBut Carney, pointing to other one-term presidents such as Jimmy Carter and the late George H.W. Bush, acknowledged that Trump will absolutely still have some clout.\\n\\nAnd while only 8 Senate Republicans stood by president's push to reverse the election results - following the attack on the Capitol, nearly two thirds of House Republicans remained with Trump. That large group included the top two House Republicans - minority leader Kevin McCarthy and minority whip Steve Scalise.\\n\\nNew Hampshire state Rep. Fred Doucette, who served as 2016 and 2020 Trump campaign co-chair in the Granite State, pointed out that close to 75 million people voted for the man. Is there going to be an effect? Yes.

Absolutely.\\n\\nDoucette noted that the core Trump supporters are Republicans but some of the president's ardent backers are more supporters of the president than necessarily the Republican Party.\\n\\nAnd he told Fox News that he's already hearing some buzzing of third party talk.\\n\\nDoucette acknowledged that anybody would be foolish to say that this week's events weren't going to have an effect. It will definitely have an effect.\\n\\nBut pointing to the president's robust war chest – Trump's raised roughly $250 million from supporters since the November election – Doucette said he'll absolutely have influence going forward. I think he's going to remain a force.\\n\\nBut how much of a force is the big question.\\n\\nCarney cautioned that it's just way too early to know what happens."}

Given the hysterical reaction of Washington's foreign policy establishment about the president's Syria decision, there will certainly be an even more shrill the sky is falling chorus regarding Afghanistan. But whatever one thinks of the president's temperament, his management style, and the decision-making process (or lack thereof), his decision about Syria was the right thing to do, and so is his decision to pull back in Afghanistan. After more than 17 years, it's well past time to wind down America's longest war.\\n\\nIt is important to remember the original mission in Afghanistan authorized by Congress was to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons. In other words, Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the then Taliban-led government in Afghanistan (because they gave safe haven to bin Laden and al Qaeda.)\\n\\nThe Taliban was driven from power in a matter of weeks. Over the next few years, al Qaeda's senior leadership was disrupted and scattered—largely to neighboring Pakistan.

So the original mission has been long since accomplished.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE ON AFGHANISTAN AT FOXNEWS.COM\\n\\nYet along the way, well before bin Laden was killed, the mission morphed into propping up the fledgling Karzai government in Kabul. As such, the U.S. military effort was no longer about going after those who were responsible for 9/11, but became an exercise in democratic nation-building.\\n\\nBut—however desirable a representative, multiethnic, democratic government in Afghanistan would be—it is not an absolute necessity for U.S. national security. The overriding requirement is that whatever government controls Afghanistan, it understands that the United States will not tolerate support for or the harboring of any terrorist group with global reach that directly threatens the United States—even if such a government is not a friendly government. Al Qaeda and ISIS are terrorist threats in Afghanistan, but neither are a direct, existential threat to the American homeland.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMoreover, we can't commit the military resources required to fight a war in Afghanistan, a fact that policymakers have been unwilling to acknowledge or discuss with the American public.\\n\\nAccording to FM3-24, the U.S. Army's counterinsurgency manual, Twenty counterinsurgents per 1000 residents is often considered the minimum troop density required for effective COIN [counterinsurgency] operations. With a population of over 33 million, a force of 660,000 troops would be needed in Afghanistan. For a sense of scale, the total U.S. Army active duty force is less than 500,000 soldiers. It's also worth noting that peak U.S. troop deployment during the Vietnam War was more than 500,000 soldiers and we did not win that counterinsurgent operation.\\n\\nEven if the whole of Afghanistan doesn't need to be secured, it is still a bridge too far. According to the most recent Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) quarterly report, 11.6 million Afghans live in areas either under the control of, or contested by, insurgents. That would require 232,000 troops, which is more than double the peak U.S. troop deployment in Afghanistan of roughly 100,000 soldiers and some 15 times more than the current force in Afghanistan.\\n\\nFinally, cost cannot be ignored. According to the Pentagon, the war in Afghanistan is costing $45 billion per year. A report published last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded that Department of Defense (DoD) Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the Afghan conflict from Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 to FY 2018 would be more than $840 billion. However, one estimate has the war costing more than $1 trillion to date and another estimates total war spending for Afghanistan at roughly $2 trillion when other war-related costs are included.\\n\\nNo wonder a recent survey found that 57 percent of Americans, including 69 percent of military veterans, said they would support a decision by the president to remove all troops from Afghanistan.\\n\\nIt would be easy to dismiss President Trump's decision to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan as simply a political decision in which Trump is making good on a campaign promise. The reality is that it reflects what Americans want because they understand that a continued U.S. military presence Afghanistan no longer is in our national security interest— it's a conflict we don't need to fight, can't win, and can't afford."}

Talk about showing your hand, conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News.\\n\\nAcosta will probably get shipped off to cover Mar-a-Lago where he can yell at Trump from outside, Barron joked, but Acosta will actually anchor a to-be-determined weekend show and serve as chief domestic correspondent.\\n\\nTRUMP SLAMS CNN'S ACOSTA FOR PRESS CONFERENCE PERFORMANCE: 'YOU ARE A RUDE, TERRIBLE PERSON'\\n\\nThe Spectator's U.S. Washington editor Amber Athey used to work alongside Acosta when she was the White House correspondent for the Daily Caller. She finds it peculiar that CNN would replace Acosta, who emerged as a household name and hero of the so-called resistance to Trump with his aggressive style.\\n\\nIt certainly seems odd that CNN is pulling Acosta from the White House rotation right as a Democratic president is set to take office. He insisted repeatedly that his style of shouting questions, delivering monologues, and heckling White House officials was merely about holding powerful people accountable for their actions, Athey told Fox News. Is CNN effectively saying that they don't want to hold the Biden administration accountable in the same way?\\n\\nDuring his time in the White House, Acosta became known for his combative style of questioning members of the administration.

His White House pass was revoked later that day but it was eventually restored when CNN argued that it violated the network and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights. The encounter with the aide didn't change his style, as Acosta has continued his aggressive behavior toward members of the Trump administration that is often seen as grandstanding.\\n\\nHe was recently mocked for claiming that covering Trump was an experience that might merit hazard pay.\\n\\nCNN also announced that The Lead with Jake Tapper will expand from 4-6 p.m., The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer will move to 6 p.m., Dana Bash -- who has repeatedly been passed over for a solo show -- will now co-anchor State of the Union, Abby Phillip will anchor Inside Politics Sunday and Pamela Brown will anchor CNN Newsroom on weekends.\\n\\nKAYLEIGH MCENANY SCOLDS CNN'S JIM ACOSTA OVER TRUMP CORONAVIRUS QUESTION\\n\\nKaitlan Collins will replace Acosta on the White House beat, but Barron isn't expecting tough questions for Biden's incoming White House press secretary, Jen Psaki.\\n\\nThe new CNN White House correspondent will just be a Muppet who nods their head in agreement with whatever the Biden administration spins. — Chris Barron\\n\\nThe new CNN White House correspondent will just be a Muppet who nods their head in agreement with whatever the Biden administration spins, Barron said. CNN stopped pretending to be an objective news outlet and they aren't even trying to hide it anymore.\\n\\nDePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall agrees that CNN intends to give the Biden administration a very easy go of it, which he feels started during the campaign.\\n\\nABC'S JONATHAN KARL KNOCKS CNN'S JIM ACOSTA IN NEW BOOK: HE EXPLICITLY PLAYS INTO TRUMP'S STRATEGY WITH THE MEDIA\\n\\nThe CNN narrative for four years was that Trump was a disaster and a threat to democracy. Giving the Biden administration soft coverage helps bolster the previous Trump narrative and serves also to justify the Trump resistance CNN helped manage. If CNN battled Biden like they battled Trump, the rhetorical signal would be that the administrations might not be all that different, McCall told Fox News, noting that CNN would be able to help the journalism industry if it actually challenged the Biden administration in sensible ways.\\n\\nIt would do a lot to restore public trust in the news industry that all administrations deserve media scrutiny, not just favored ones. The media industry is supposed to be serving as watchdogs for the public of all government officials, not as lapdogs for particular politicians that journalists favor, McCall said.\\n\\nWhile critics of CNN don't expect the liberal network to hold Biden's feet to the fire, NewsBusters executive editor Tim Graham said it's painfully obvious that Acosta wasn't long for the White House once Biden prevailed against Trump.\\n\\nHis raging, lecturing routine has no place in the Biden press corps. The transition from rabid lion to Poppin Fresh would have been stunning. What we're to get now is repeaters, not reporters, Graham told Fox News. The liberal networks say they won't be 'stenographers to power,' but that's exactly what they sound like most of the time when they are covering Democrats.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAs for Tapper getting an extra hour of the air every day, Graham feels that it's simply a sign that CNN has no issues with an anchor spouting off partisan opinions.\\n\\nNo one can call Tapper's show a 'straight news' show, and his Twitter feed is also a gusher of liberal hot takes. CNN's coverage of the Biden campaign -- and especially their 'let's hide' press strategy -- displays how deeply enmeshed with the Democratic public-relations machine they are, Graham said."}

He has taken his personal health kick to the next level by running marathons and writing books like Quit Digging Your Grave With A Knife And Fork.\\n\\nHe is also using his success story to wage war on junk food in public schools in hopes of targeting childhood obesity rates. Other states, under pressure to encourage healthier eating habits for children, are developing similar school programs.\\n\\nBut some critics argue that it's not the state or federal government's job to regulate food and beverages in public schools. School boards and communities are more in tune with the needs of their schools, said Radley Balko, a CATO Institute policy analyst.\\n\\nI don't think the federal government has any business telling them what to do, Balko said. I think it should be done at the local level.\\n\\nNearly 15 percent of children ranging from ages 6 to 19 are obese, according to the American Obesity Association. Nationally, nine out of 10 public schools sold soda, chips and candy in school year 2003-2004, according to the Government Accountability Office.\\n\\nHuckabee, who is retiring in January after 10 years as governor, put the issue at the top of his to-do list, and Arkansas schools removed high-calorie snacks and beverages from vending machines and cafeterias and replaced them with juice, milk and healthy foods.\\n\\nFollowing his lead, the state Legislature required public school students' weights to be assessed using the BMI, or Body Mass Index, scale. It also formed an advisory panel to institute a campaign to target rising childhood obesity rates in the state.\\n\\nBMI is a ratio of height and weight, identifying healthy or unhealthy levels through percentiles. Percentiles are used to categorize children for being overweight, at risk for overweight, healthy or underweight, based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nThe Child Nutrition and Reauthorization Act set a BMI measurement to identify overweight and obesity levels. Overweight falls in the greater than or equal to 95th percentile, at risk for overweight falls between 85th and less than 95th percentile, healthy falls between 5th and less than 85th percentile and underweight is less than 5th percentile. Results are confidentially mailed home to parents.\\n\\nThe state recently released its third annual assessment of childhood and adolescent obesity. Huckabee touted the results as evidence that the efforts have halted the upward trend of childhood obesity in the state.\\n\\nWe have stopped the locomotive train of childhood obesity in its tracks, Huckabee said. Now it's time to turn the train around and move full speed ahead to healthier living.\\n\\nBut Balko said Arkansas' plan for sending BMI report cards home to parents may cause more harm than good by contributing to self-esteem issues.\\n\\nIt's going to do damage to a kid's self-esteem, Balko said. You may be actually causing more damage.\\n\\nA Huckabee spokesman said the governor decided to get involved after realizing the health impacts of obesity and the amount of money being spent on treatments related to diseases linked to obesity.\\n\\nFrom a political standpoint and as chief executive officer of the state, the amount of Medicaid money that is spent is astronomical, said spokeswoman Alice Stewart. Instead of treating the snake bites, he thinks it's time to go after the snakes.\\n\\nThe involvement of government helps give attention to the issue and make progress, said Carole Garner, assistant professor at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.\\n\\nIt seems like everyone is moving forward, Garner said.\\n\\nThe issue has also caught the attention of congressional leaders. The Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2006, a bipartisan bill backed by Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., among others, would revise how the government defines food of minimal nutritional value. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry where it stalled before Congress recessed.\\n\\nThe legislation would update the definition to current nutrition science to restrict junk food in schools and protect federal dollars in the national school lunch and breakfast programs. The measure is awaiting consideration in the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\\n\\nThis needs to be something that government on all levels needs to address, said Sharon Huang, a spokeswoman for Parents Action for Children, a nonpartisan and nonprofit group that promotes children's issues and supports the federal legislation.\\n\\nBut the legislation faces some hurdles. From a revenue standpoint, some schools could lose out because they get a percentage of the sales. Food and beverage industry representatives add that legislation to remove soft drinks from schools is not necessary\\n\\nParents, teachers, government, health officials and industry must all work together to help our nation's children grow up healthier, said Tracey Halliday, a spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association, which represents the nation's non-alcoholic refreshment beverage industry.\\n\\nThe beverage association teamed up with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation — a joint initiative of the William J. Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association — to form guidelines to provide healthier alternatives to soda and high-calorie drinks in schools.\\n\\nIn the May 2006 agreement, the nation's largest beverage distributors agreed to sell only water, unsweetened juice and low-fat milk in elementary and middle schools. High schools can sell beverages, including soda, that offer less than 10 calories per serving and juice, sports drinks and low-fat milk, according to the agreement.\\n\\nMost schools will see the changes by the 2008-2009 school year.\\n\\nFood Report Card Targets States\\n\\nThe Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit group, recently released a report card on what nutrition policies are set in schools for foods sold outside of school meals such as in school stores, à la carte lines and vending machines.\\n\\nTwenty-three states received an F for not having policies for those foods and there is a lot of room for improvement, said Joy Johanson, a senior policy associate at the center.\\n\\nWe think that the states that have set policies definitely provide one helpful component to the solution of childhood obesity, Johanson said.\\n\\nBalko said schools should be educating students, not worrying about their food choices.\\n\\nI'm not sure it's the job of schools to keep kids fit, Balko said."}

Good Sunday morning, everybody.\\n\\nThanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.\\n\\nStraight ahead right here on Sunday Morning Futures, my exclusive\\n\\ninterview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as President Trump hits\\n\\nIran with new sanctions. Plus, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is here on why he is\\n\\ncalling on the president to delay the State of the Union. He will join me\\n\\ncoming up live. Then, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on the House voting to limit the\\n\\npresident's war powers and why he says the measure has no teeth.\\n\\nAlso, ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes,\\n\\nis here with exclusive news. He will break news on the Ukraine whistle-\\n\\nblower complaint this morning. Plus, Florida Senator Rick Scott joins me to discuss the Senate impeachment\\n\\ntrial expected to finally begin this week, as the articles are being sent.\\n\\nAll that and a lot more right now, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning\\n\\nFutures. And we begin in the Middle East this morning.\\n\\nThe Trump administration is ratcheting up sanctions against Iran, after\\n\\nTehran targets American troops with missiles. Protesters are now rising up\\n\\nin the streets of Iran against the ayatollah, after Iran admits mistakenly\\n\\ndowning the Ukrainian airliner.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Asia, voters in Taiwan reelect the incumbent president,\\n\\nsupporting her tough stance against mainland China, this as we look ahead\\n\\nto this week's signing ceremony for the phase one of the U.S.-China trade\\n\\ndeal, all of this coming amid a record stock market performance and more\\n\\nsigns of job growth in America.\\n\\nJoining me right now, exclusively this morning, is Treasury Secretary Steve\\n\\nMnuchin.\\n\\nAnd, Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for\\n\\nbeing here.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Thank you, Maria. It's great to\\n\\nbe with you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Incredible pictures across the world of protesters and people\\n\\ntaking to the streets wanting freedom, wanting democracy.\\n\\nLet's start in Iran, where we did see those protesters this weekend. The\\n\\nU.S. has targeted Iran's billion-dollar metals industry and senior regime\\n\\nofficials. Tell us about these latest round of sanctions against Iran.\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: Maria, let me just start by first expressing our condolences to\\n\\nthe families that were involved in the crash. Obviously, it is just a\\n\\nterrible, tragic situation.\\n\\nThe additional sanctions that we put on this week and the additional\\n\\nexecutive order that the president authorized gave us additional\\n\\ncapabilities to target both primary and secondary sanctions in different\\n\\nsectors, including the metals industry, construction, and travel, amongst\\n\\nothers.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: The economy there has already weakened quite a bit. You talked\\n\\nabout this with Secretary Pompeo on Friday.\\n\\nHere is the secretary, Pompeo, with me last week on this program talking\\n\\nabout the state of the Iranian economy today. Watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nMIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have crippled their economy.\\n\\nThey have never been in this position, Maria. Iran has never been in a\\n\\nplace where they have been challenged, not only economically, but\\n\\ndiplomatically, with a global coalition that, in May of last year, put out\\n\\na united statement against Iran. This is a challenge and a strategy that President Trump has laid out that\\n\\nwe're executing with great vigor. And it will protect and preserve and\\n\\ndefend the American people.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Is there anything left or anyone left to sanction? I mean, how\\n\\nmuch farther can you go? And what do you need to see from the Iranian\\n\\nregime to actually take these sanctions away?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: Well, with the new executive order, we have very, very strong\\n\\nauthorities now across all industries, including in this executive\\n\\nauthority. It gave both myself and Secretary Pompeo the authority to target additional\\n\\nsectors as needed. And, Maria, this is all really about cutting off money, oil sales, other\\n\\nrevenue that would be funding their terrorist activities and their nuclear\\n\\nweapons development. So we continue to allow for humanitarian transactions\\n\\nwith Iran. I'm pleased to say that OFAC expedited all the waivers, as I said they\\n\\nwould, as it relates to the airline crash investigation. And we don't want\\n\\nto target people of Iran. We want to cut off revenues that are going for\\n\\nbad acts.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And yet there is a real partnership developing and deepening\\n\\nbetween Iran and China -- actually, I should say, Iran, China and Russia.\\n\\nBut let's stay with Iran and China for a moment.\\n\\nAs you know, the expectations are that 50 to 70 percent of Iran's oil\\n\\nexports are flowing to China. Why is China allowed to go around these\\n\\nsanctions and do business with Iran, 70 percent of their oil and gas going\\n\\nto China?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: Well, Maria, let me just say we have got cut off probably over 95\\n\\npercent of the oil revenues. So there is a very small amount of oil revenues. And you're right. A\\n\\ncomponent of that, a big component of that is China.\\n\\nI sat down with the Chinese officials. They flew in a delegation to meet\\n\\nwith us in the State Department to talk about this. They have cut off all\\n\\nof the state companies from buying oil. And we're working closely with them\\n\\nto make sure that they cease all additional oil activities.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So you are pursuing trying to get China to cease all\\n\\nactivities? Because they're obviously giving Iran the money, and Iran is using the\\n\\nmoney to support terrorism, if 70 percent of their oil and gas is going to\\n\\nChina.\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: It is 70 percent, Maria. But let me just say, it's 70 percent of a very, very small number.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: OK.\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: And China is subject to sanctions, like everybody else.\\n\\nWe actually sanctioned some of their shipping companies that were involved\\n\\nin the oil. And we will continue to pursue sanctions activities against\\n\\nChina and anybody else around the world that continues to do business with\\n\\nthem.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So what about France? You know, France is doing business Iran\\n\\nas well. What about the NATO countries, including France, that seem to be\\n\\ncontinuing their relationship with Iran, even as the U.S. pleads with them\\n\\nnot to, promising sanctions? Are we going to see secondary sanctions?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: The Europeans are adhering to our primary sanctions. Again, as we\\n\\nroll out additional sectors, they will be cutting back activities in those\\n\\nsectors. But the Europeans are complying with our primary sanctions, because they\\n\\nwould be subject to secondary sanctions. And they understand that. And even\\n\\nin the case of INSTEX, we have warned INSTEX that they may be -- depending\\n\\nupon how they set it up, they would most likely be subject to secondary\\n\\nsanctions as well. But, again, let me just emphasize, humanitarian transactions are available.\\n\\nWe're setting up a Swiss channel to handle that. So, this is not about\\n\\nattacking the people of Iran. This is about, as the president said, making\\n\\nsure that Iran stops their terrorist activities and making sure that they\\n\\nnever have nuclear weapons.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Let me move on to China, because you are planning a big event\\n\\nthis Wednesday, the signing ceremony for the phase one deal between the\\n\\nU.S. and China. Is this same deal that you told us about at the end of last year?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: It is. And let me just say, Ambassador Lighthizer has led a very, very large team\\n\\nacross all the different agencies. Almost every single one of our agencies\\n\\nhave been involved in this. And this is really a historic transaction.\\n\\nNow, it's is not everything. And, as we have said, there will be a phase\\n\\ntwo. But this is the first time we have had a comprehensive agreement with\\n\\nChina on technology issues, agricultural issues, financial services,\\n\\npurchases, and has a real enforcement mechanism. So this is a big win for\\n\\nthe president.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: The last time we spoke about this, looking at this deal at the\\n\\nend of last year, we were expecting that there would be a snap-back\\n\\nprovision in there where, if China doesn't keep its promises, if they lie,\\n\\nas they have for so many times to so many different parties, that the U.S.\\n\\nwould be able to snap back tariffs and -- in place. Is that still in it, or has that been changed through translation?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: No, that is still in it, Maria. There is a real enforcement\\n\\nprovision. And if they don't comply with the agreement, the president\\n\\nretains the authority to put on tariffs, both existing tariffs and\\n\\nadditional tariffs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And what about the agricultural buying, because that is another\\n\\nquestion? There are concerns this morning, as you know, Secretary, that the language\\n\\nhas been changed in translation. Why wasn't the English version released to\\n\\nthe public, so that we can understand specifically what is in the deal\\n\\nwe're away -- 48 hours from signing? People want to see the English\\n\\nversion. Was it changed in translation?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: Maria, let me first say it wasn't changed in translation. I don't\\n\\nknow where that rumor started. We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was\\n\\nreally a technical issue. And the language will be released this week. So I\\n\\nthink it is -- the day of the signing, we will be releasing the English\\n\\nversion. And people can see. This is a very, very extensive agreement.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So, you expect the Chinese to buy $40 billion to $50 billion of\\n\\nagricultural products from the United States, then?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: I do. Let me just say, it is $200 billion of additional products across the board\\n\\nover the next two years, and, Specifically, in agriculture, $40 billion to $50 billion.\\n\\nSo, this is a big opportunity for our farmers. And I think some people have\\n\\nquestioned whether they can produce it. And the president said they are\\n\\ngoing to go out and buy more land and produce plenty of agriculture.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: On the intellectual property issues, you have been talking a\\n\\nlot about protecting I.P. for American companies and innovators.\\n\\nIs it true the Chinese recently adopted malicious cybersecurity rules that\\n\\nnegate any opportunity for the U.S. to protect its intellectual property?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: No, Maria, that is not true.\\n\\nThere are very important intellectual property rules in here that we expect\\n\\nthem to adhere to. There are cyber concerns that we do have. So let me just\\n\\nbe clear. Cyber will be part of phase two.\\n\\nBut we have incorporated provisions in phase one that we think are\\n\\nimportant protections for U.S. companies. So, we have made very clear there\\n\\ncan be no forced technology transfer and that China is putting out laws to\\n\\nprotect both U.S. technology and other technology.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So all of your plans are coming together? You have got the\\n\\nsigning ceremony on Wednesday. You have got USMCA likely going to pass the\\n\\nSenate. When would you expect that?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: I know it is going through the Senate committees now. We expect\\n\\nit to pass quickly. We hope that this little sideshow that is going to show\\n\\nup at the Senate doesn't delay it. But we look forward to the Senate acting\\n\\nquickly. And let me just say, the president's economic program is really coming\\n\\ntogether. As we have talked about Maria, from day one, it's tax cuts, it's\\n\\nregulatory relief, and it is trade. And the president has delivered on all\\n\\nthree. You saw the stock market break 29000 for the first time last week.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: That was pretty incredible, actually. Looking at the backdrop in the terms of the economic growth story, that is\\n\\nwhat driving the markets. I know that we got more signs of jobs growth on\\n\\nFriday, with the jobs numbers coming out,although it is slowing down from\\n\\nthe numbers we saw about a year ago. What would be your expectation for growth, economic growth, and jobs in 2020?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: Well, Maria, I wouldn't focus on any one week. We have created\\n\\nmore jobs under President Trump than ever created before.\\n\\nThat is something that we continue to focus on. And we look forward to a\\n\\nhealthy economy in 2020. Now, let me just say there is no question that the\\n\\nBoeing -- the Boeing situation, it is going to slow down the GDP numbers.\\n\\nBoeing is one of the largest exporters.\\n\\nAnd with the 737 MAX, I think that could impact GDP as much as 50 basis\\n\\npoints this year. But we -- we look forward to very healthy growth in 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And the trade story is one leg of the three legs in terms of\\n\\nderegulation, tax legislation, and the trade changes that you are making\\n\\nand the administration has led here. Would you expect things to pick up in 2021, then? What is your expectation\\n\\nin terms of economic growth?\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: Well, I think, for this year, we have been looking at 2.5 to 3\\n\\npercent, as I said. It may be closer to 2.5 because of the adjustment of\\n\\nthe Boeing numbers. But this would have been 3 percent otherwise. And I think there is no\\n\\nquestion that USMCA and the China deal are going to add significantly to\\n\\ngrowth.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Secretary, I know you have got a big week, with the China\\n\\nsigning and these incredible growth numbers, with the stock market\\n\\nreacting. Great to talk with you this morning. Thanks so much.\\n\\n\\n\\nMNUCHIN: Thank you, Maria.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining me. Coming up, the House voting to limit the president's war powers. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will join me next with exclusive reaction. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, and on Instagram\\n\\n@SundayFutures. Stay with us. Let us know what you would like to hear from this incredible\\n\\nlineup of guests, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. Back in a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Congress now grappling with the fallout from the killing of Iranian General\\n\\nQasem Soleimani. The House passed a resolution that reaffirms the 1973 War Powers Act. That\\n\\nseeks to limit the president from taking further military action. Many\\n\\nRepublicans say this could actually weaken America's position in the Middle\\n\\nEast. Joining me right now is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, it's always a pleasure. Thanks so much for being with me.\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Let's go through these -- War Powers Act.\\n\\nThe House, obviously, on Friday voted. Can you tell us a little bit this\\n\\nand where this is going?\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCARTHY: Well, this is -- this resolution we passed is going nowhere,\\n\\nbecause it's way they passed it.\\n\\nThey did a concurrent resolution. And you have to understand this, Maria,\\n\\nthat a concurrent resolution is only used for like the Soap Box Derby or\\n\\ngiving a medal that we did to Jack Nicklaus.\\n\\nThis is nonbinding. This will not go to the president. It will not change\\n\\nthe War Powers Act.\\n\\nAnd it's what the Democrats have done. I mean, think about what the --\\n\\nPresident Trump has done. It is his natural instinct to always put America\\n\\nfirst and keep us safe. The Democrats' instinct is to blame America first.\\n\\nInstead of having a resolution on the floor condemning Iran for shooting\\n\\ndown a civilian aircraft, or will we have resolution on the floor this week\\n\\nstanding with those individuals who seek freedom in Iran? I don't believe\\n\\nwe will, because these Democrats will do anything to defame the president\\n\\nover defending this nation.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Eight Democrats opposed this resolution. Six are in the swing\\n\\ndistricts won by Donald Trump. Talk about that, because I know that you\\n\\nhave talked before in the past about those swing districts really watching\\n\\nand pressuring Nancy Pelosi to not go forward with the impeachment.\\n\\nBut we know that the articles are going to the Senate this upcoming week.\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCARTHY: Well, last year, it would take 19 new seats to win the majority.\\n\\nAnd this year, it only takes 18, because a Democrat, Jeff Van Drew,\\n\\nswitched party over impeachment and the way Nancy Pelosi has been treating.\\n\\nHe is more -- he is a Republican now on where his positions are. There are\\n\\n30 Democrats who sit in seats that President Trump carried. We only need 18\\n\\nto win the majority. They're seeing the tide continuing to shift, as Nancy\\n\\nPelosi, the speaker of the House, continues to stand with the socialist\\n\\nwing of the Democratic Party, instead of standing where America wants to\\n\\nsee us.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So what happens this week? You have got vote on the House\\n\\nmanagers for the impeachment trial.\\n\\nAnd then this impeachment trial, which I assume will begin this upcoming\\n\\nweek, could go for several weeks. Tell us how you see it playing out.\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCARTHY: Well, we first have to name the managers and vote on it.\\n\\nRemember where the Democrats said this was so urgent, that they had to move\\n\\nthis so quickly, before end of the year. And now Nancy Pelosi has been\\n\\nholding the papers?\\n\\nSo, sometimes, we will vote after their caucus, would be Wednesday or\\n\\nThursday. So, I find it very difficult for the Senate to even start\\n\\nimpeachment this week. And what happens with impeachment is, the senators\\n\\nhave to be in their desks. They cannot have a phone. They cannot talk to\\n\\none another. And they stay in their desks.\\n\\nWith the Clinton impeachment, it lasted five weeks. And this is the dirty\\n\\nlittle secret that nobody is talking about, why the speaker held these\\n\\npapers. Remember what happened in the last nomination process, where the DNC\\n\\nchairman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to resign the night before the\\n\\nnomination convention started, because they had found out they had cheated\\n\\nSenator Bernie Sanders from the opportunity to become the nominee.\\n\\nThey are doing the exact same thing right now. The Iowa caucus is on\\n\\nFebruary 3. Bernie Sanders is in first place. And what this does is, this\\n\\nbenefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and\\n\\ncould become their nominee, because he will be stuck in a chair, because\\n\\nNancy Pelosi held the papers, different than what she said to the American\\n\\npublic why she had to move so urgently.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So, you think that it is by design that Nancy Pelosi is sending\\n\\nthe articles now, slow-walking, really, slow-walking the impeachment trial,\\n\\nto have the senators in the room? I mean, that is collusion. That is obstruction, once again keeping Bernie\\n\\nSanders at bay, and clearing the decks for Joe Biden? Is that what you're\\n\\nsaying?\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCARTHY: That is exactly what I'm saying.\\n\\nRemember what the Democratic Party did this time. They removed the\\n\\nsuperdelegates from the first round of voting because what they had done to\\n\\nSenator Sanders. Now they don't have the power, had he got to the convention fairly. So,\\n\\nwhat power does the speaker have? Remember, when she first started\\n\\nimpeachment, I sent her a letter about process, could we have a fair\\n\\nprocess, laying out 10 questions, the exact same process for Bill Clinton\\n\\nand Richard Nixon. She ignored that and didn't care about process.\\n\\nNow she tries, in hypocrisy, bring up process in the Senate, where she has\\n\\nno power?\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Wow.\\n\\n\\n\\nMCCARTHY: She told the American public it was urgent. She had to move so\\n\\nfast. The only reason why she should be -- that she is doing this that no one is\\n\\ntalking about, it is harming the -- Bernie Sanders, the senator, who has\\n\\nbeen coming into first place, who could win Iowa and propel himself to be\\n\\nthe nominee. It's the exact same thing they did to him four years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: That is unbelievable, actually. That is breaking news,\\n\\nCongressman. Thanks very much for joining us with this, this morning. We will see you\\n\\nsoon, Kevin McCarthy. Up next, my exclusive interview with the always outspoken former White\\n\\nHouse strategist Steve Bannon -- his reaction to developments with Iran,\\n\\nChina, why he says the president should delay the State of the Union\\n\\nimmediately, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. Back in a minute with Steve Bannon.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back.\\n\\nBreaking news this morning on support for democracy and freedom rising in\\n\\nthe Middle East and Asia.\\n\\nIn Iran, protests in the street after the country's leaders admit\\n\\nmistakenly shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing all 176 people on\\n\\nboard. In Taiwan, voters are celebrating this weekend, the island's pro-democracy\\n\\nleader winning reelection, again, people in the streets wanting freedom and\\n\\ndemocracy. And in Hong Kong, protesters holding up the American flag as they fight for\\n\\nfreedom. Joining me right now on what it all means for America is former White House\\n\\nchief strategist, host of the hit podcast, wildly successful, War Room.\\n\\nSteve Bannon is here. Steve, it's great to see you.\\n\\n\\n\\nSTEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me,\\n\\nMaria.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Reaction to what's taking place across the world?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Look, this is the Trump doctrine, whether it's in Hong Kong at\\n\\nballot box in Taiwan, in the streets of Tehran, freedom and democracy.\\n\\nThis is what -- President Trump has stood up to the Chinese Communist\\n\\nParty, the dictators in Beijing. He's stood up to the mullahs in Tehran.\\n\\nAnd now you're seeing it. You're seeing the people, whether it's at the\\n\\nballot box in Hong Kong or in the protest. They just had a sweeping victory\\n\\nthere a couple of weeks ago, a landslide victory for the -- for the freedom\\n\\nand democracy party in Taiwan, with a record turnout.\\n\\nAnd this is with the Chinese Communist Party trying to put their thumb on\\n\\nthe scale to try to do it, in Tehran, the exact same thing. Remember, in\\n\\nHong Kong, and in Taipei, you're seeing the American flag. They're waving\\n\\nin these American -- these independence movements, these freedom movements.\\n\\nThey have gotten President Trump -- posters of President Trump as Superman\\n\\nor some sort of superhero. This is the Trump policy. It's ironic that, this\\n\\nweek, we're going to have the signing of the Chinese trade deal.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: At the same time, they're moving -- they're going to vote to send\\n\\nthe impeachment articles over to the House, because these are inextricably\\n\\nlinked. What President Trump did is go against the established order. The\\n\\nestablished order, the permanent political class' foreign policy was to\\n\\nappease these dictators, to appease piece Beijing. And that's why you saw\\n\\nthe rise of China. To appease the mullahs in Iran. And that's why you saw\\n\\nthis -- this expansion, this expansion of Iran in -- with Hezbollah\\n\\nthroughout the Middle East. Donald Trump said, this is not going to happen on my watch. We're going to\\n\\nstop here and now. He's taken a very Churchillian stand, like Churchill\\n\\ntook in the 1930s. It's the permanent political class and the John Kerrys,\\n\\nthe Hillary Clintons, the foreign policy establishment, the Neville Chamberlains. They were the appeasers. He stopped the appeasement. He went to economic\\n\\nwar. He -- in the trade deals.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: He did economic war with the tariffs against China. He put\\n\\neconomic sanctions on Tehran. Economic war is winning.\\n\\nAnd the people in the streets support Donald Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, the Democrats don't see it that way, Steve.\\n\\nShe is sending the articles for impeachment over to the Senate. We're going\\n\\nto have a Senate trial. And yet I can't figure out if, in fact, the\\n\\npresident wants witnesses or doesn't want witnesses. What is this going to\\n\\nlook like? Why is it that this freedom, this democracy, this movement in the economic\\n\\ngrowth story is not resonating on his critics?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Well, listen, they're not.\\n\\nThis is why they oppose him, the established order. First off, they hating\\n\\npersonally. But more importantly, they oppose his America first policies,\\n\\nbecause the America first policies are resonating.\\n\\nFreedom and capitalism are resonating around the world. And that's what\\n\\nthey oppose. And this is why he's continuing to push this forward.\\n\\nRemember, when they put these articles of impeachment up, what they want to\\n\\ndo is basically bigfoot everything he's doing. They want to have -- and\\n\\nthis is, I think, the problem Mitch McConnell has, is that they see this\\n\\nkind of trial as being on C-SPAN, right, with some very tight legal\\n\\narguments. I think President Trump and the reason on Laura Ingraham the other night\\n\\nhe called for an expanded -- he called for an expanded witness list was, he\\n\\nunderstands that the jury is not the Senate. The jury is the American\\n\\npeople, but the audience is the world. They're watching on the streets of Taipei. They're watching in Hong Kong.\\n\\nThey're watching in Tehran. They're watching to see if the established\\n\\nborder can back down Donald Trump.\\n\\nAnd Donald Trump has the ability to win here. And that's why I have been\\n\\ncalling it the trial the century. He calls it the crime of the century. It\\n\\nis the crime of the century. It should be treated like that. And that's\\n\\nwhy, on Laura Ingraham, he walked through the witnesses he wants.\\n\\nI think those witnesses have to be called.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: The crime of the century, meaning that this was a coup.\\n\\nKevin McCarthy was on several times over the last year, who called it the\\n\\nworst coup that we have seen ever in our history of our country. That's why\\n\\nthe president calls for these witnesses.\\n\\nLet's listen to the president on Laura Ingraham the other night in that\\n\\ngreat interview. Watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would like a trial.\\n\\nAnd I'd love to have sleepy Joe Biden. I'd love to have his son. I call\\n\\nthem where's Hunter? I have changed his first name to where. Where's\\n\\nHunter? I'd love to have the whistle-blower who wrote a fake report.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Will we get there? Will we actually get all those people to\\n\\ntestify? Because that will expose the crime of the century.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: If they're making a big deal on the Democratic side, and some of\\n\\nthese moderate senators are starting to call -- they want Bolton and\\n\\nMulvaney and the e-mails and Vought at OMB. Bring them. What do they have to show?\\n\\nDonald Trump did nothing wrong. This is why -- it's just like his support\\n\\nof the freedom movements throughout the world. And, yesterday, he tweets\\n\\nout in Farsi to support the people in the streets of Tehran. The\\n\\nestablished order were appeasers. They appeased the Chinese Communist\\n\\nParty. They appeased the mullahs.\\n\\nHe stood up to that. And he showed you, in the crime of the century, we\\n\\nshould have the whistle-blower up. We should have Hunter Biden up. And we\\n\\nshould have the gentleman Horowitz, who wrote the I.G. report.\\n\\nWe should have those people up there. They should testify. If you have to\\n\\ntrade off by having John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, who cares? What are they\\n\\ngoing to say?\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So...\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Right?\\n\\nWhat President Trump said at the very beginning of this, when we started\\n\\nour podcast, unity and substance. I did nothing wrong. This call was\\n\\nperfect. And I think the facts bear him out. It's one of the reasons -- two reasons\\n\\nNancy Pelosi slow-walked this. One was to find more evidence, OK, because\\n\\nthey didn't have it. And they are afraid the guns are going to be turned\\n\\nback on them for a weak case. The second was to make sure she could bigfoot President Trump's State of\\n\\nthe Union message. That's why she slow-walked this entire thing. President\\n\\nTrump understands that the jury is the American people. The audience is the\\n\\nworld. The world is watching this. That's why he has to take a hard stand, I believe.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, so you want him to delay the State of the Union.\\n\\nI got to ask you about that, because you are asking him, calling for him to\\n\\nmake this announcement tomorrow morning. Let's take a short break. We have got a lot more with Steve Bannon when we come right back. Stay with us.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And I'm back with Steve Bannon. He is former White House chief\\n\\nstrategist, host of the War Room podcast.\\n\\nEarlier, I mentioned that comment by Kevin McCarthy, where he said that we\\n\\njust witnessed the attempted coup to take down President Trump. It was the\\n\\nworst coup since Lincoln, is what he said on this program.\\n\\nAnd this is one of the reasons why you believe they're not going to stop\\n\\nattacking the president. You want the president to fight back.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: This is continual. This is the nullification project to nullify\\n\\nhis presidency.\\n\\nAnd you see why. They were wrong. They are the appeasers. He's the\\n\\nChurchill figure. He has stood tall. That's why this is the trial of the\\n\\ncentury. It's about the crime of the century. It has to be big.\\n\\nThis is not C-SPAN 3. This is going to be on global television. That's why\\n\\nI believe he has to have some of the House people, like Lee Zeldin and Mark\\n\\nMeadows and Jim Jordan and Gaetz and these guys that...\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: That's not going to happen, though, is it?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Well, I think he -- I think he's still got an opportunity to do\\n\\nthat. I think the president needs them, because they need to be -- these fire-\\n\\nbreathers need to be there. We can't worry about the decorum of the Senate.\\n\\nThis is about the direction of the United States of America. It's about the\\n\\npeace and prosperity of the world. Donald Trump's policy is working. And this is why she slow-walked this. She\\n\\ninvited him to do the State of the Union, and then she purposely slow-\\n\\nwalked this, because she wants in the middle of the trial -- and I can see\\n\\nThe New York Times' headline: Under a cloud of uncertainty, Trump\\n\\naddresses the nation.\\n\\nHe has to be acquitted. He will be acquitted and exonerated. That should\\n\\nhappen. And then you do the State of the Union, because the whole world\\n\\nwill watch this.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So you're calling on President Trump to do what, tell Nancy\\n\\nPelosi what about the State of the Union?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Tell Nancy Pelosi -- hey, tell Nancy Pelosi, when you deliver it,\\n\\nand we have a trial, and after I'm acquitted, I'm going to come and have\\n\\nthe State of the Union, not until then.\\n\\nI'm not -- President Trump's got a great saying, no games, OK? This is all\\n\\ngame-playing by the Democrats. It's got to be brought to an end. OK?\\n\\nNow, they forced her this week to deliver them. That's why he's -- and I\\n\\nthink this trial, he ought to go big. He ought to demand witnesses. I think\\n\\nPresident Trump ought to demand. There's no witness on the other side of Bolton or Mulvaney. There's nothing\\n\\nthey can say that's going to be that big a deal.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, they want to hear from John Bolton.\\n\\nJohn Bolton last week, why did he come out and say, yes, I'm ready to\\n\\ntestify?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: I have no -- maybe to sell books.\\n\\nAll I know is that President Trump has to protect the office of the\\n\\npresidency for future presidents, as he said, about executive privilege.\\n\\nBut there's nothing about the details of this thing that will be any big\\n\\ndeal, offset by the whistle-blower, by Brennan, by Biden, by Hunter Biden,\\n\\nby the I.G. report. This is the crime of the century. This was an attempted coup on a sitting\\n\\npresident, a sitting president who turned out to be right. And you know who\\n\\nsays he's right? The kids in Tehran, the kids in Beirut that are in the\\n\\nstreets trying to throw off Hezbollah, the kids in Hong Kong that are\\n\\ntaking -- being gassed and taking rubber bullets, the voters in Taipei who\\n\\nyesterday threw out the Chinese Communist Party with a landslide, who all\\n\\nwave American flags, and all have signs of Donald Trump being a superhero,\\n\\non the streets of the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: The people that want freedom and democracy against these dictators\\n\\nthat Trump said, no more appeasement. I'm going to confront this, OK? I'm\\n\\ngoing to confront it, and we're going to stop it on my watch.\\n\\nThe nation should be proud of this. And if the trial is handled -- this is\\n\\nnot some technical legal thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: But doesn't that also impact the president, I mean, and his\\n\\ntimeline? Remember last time, the State of the Union. It was pushed back a week. She\\n\\nsaid she didn't want him to come to the chambers to deliver the State of\\n\\nthe Union. He was talking about giving a rally. I mean, this is deja vu all\\n\\nover again.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Well, that was more games about when he -- actually, the\\n\\ngovernment shut down because he demanded certain things, particularly for\\n\\nthe wall. The wall is going to give us security.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So, here we are questioning the State of the Union again?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Well, no, but here's the reason.\\n\\nShe's gamed this. Why did she take so long? Remember, they impeached him\\n\\nbecause he's a clear and present danger. That's what they said. He's a\\n\\nclear and present danger. We have to do this before Christmas. It has to\\n\\nhappen because all this influence in the following elections, right? He's a\\n\\nclear and present danger. They have waited for weeks for two things. They're trying to get more\\n\\nevidence. They're running around trying to get more evidence, because they\\n\\nhave no evidence. They're afraid that guns are going to be turned on them\\n\\nand they're going to be put on trial, because they don't have a case.\\n\\nThe other is that she wants him to have a State of the Union where there's\\n\\nsome uncertainty. After it's all over, after he's been exonerated, then he\\n\\ngoes before the world at the State of the Union and lays out the state of\\n\\nthis union and the state of the world.\\n\\nThe world is going to be more peaceful and prosperous and less war, because\\n\\na president like...\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: He has answered...\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: A president like Donald Trump came up, like Churchill did, and\\n\\nsaid, we're going to stop this.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Has he answered you on this? Have you told him? You have\\n\\ncalled...\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: I just -- we just said this the other day on the show. We have\\n\\nbeen saying this kind of nonstop for the last 24, 48 hours. I think, listen...\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So, do we know if he's considering delaying the State of the\\n\\nUnion?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Listen, President -- President Trump is a feel player. He\\n\\nunderstands the moment.\\n\\nHe will think this through. He understands. I also think -- he said it on\\n\\nLaura Ingraham the other night...\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: .. about who he wants as witnesses, who he would see.\\n\\nThat's the way the trial should be run. It should be, put them on trial,\\n\\nput the whistle-blower, put Brennan. Put the apparatus that tried to shut\\n\\ndown and do a coup against a democratically elected president that had the\\n\\nright ideas about how to bring peace and prosperity to the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Meanwhile...\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: The Chinese are not coming this week to sign this trade deal,\\n\\nbecause everybody mocked him on tariffs.\\n\\nHis tariffs worked. He broke them. And that's why they're here. That's why\\n\\nthey're here to sign this trade deal, is because Donald Trump's program\\n\\nworked, when everybody on Wall Street, all the op-ed pages and all the\\n\\nbusiness leaders said, oh, this is wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: It was Trump. After 20 years of allowing them to lie, cheat and\\n\\nsteal, he brought them to account. And he brought them to account because\\n\\nhe took bold and dramatic action.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, even the Democrats on stage ready to debate this week,\\n\\ntheir last debate leading up to the Iowa caucuses, believe that China is\\n\\nthe bad actor here and agree with the president holding a firm...\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: They do -- they do agree, Maria. But it's like -- they're like in\\n\\nseventh grade.\\n\\nIt's embarrassing to see what they say about what to do with China. Look at\\n\\nDonald Trump's actions on China to hold them to account, OK, to -- and\\n\\nthat's why you have got explosions in Hong Kong and Taipei, to hold the\\n\\nmullahs to account with economic warfare, not sending American troops,\\n\\nkilling bad guys when you need to kill them, but having economic warfare\\n\\nthat broke the mold and broke the mullahs.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Real quick on the debate stage this upcoming week, Michael\\n\\nBloomberg will not be there. But he's willing, apparently, to spend up to a billion dollars if he\\n\\ndoesn't get that nomination.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: On -- on -- on...\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: It worked to get the House majority last year, didn't it?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: The reason he's being impeached is because of Michael Bloomberg's\\n\\nmoney and backing these candidates that Nancy Pelosi curated.\\n\\nOn Super Tuesday, you're going to see the effect of money in the Democratic\\n\\nprimary, because he's going to drop a financial atomic weapon on the field.\\n\\nHe's already spent almost $200 million.\\n\\nMichael Bloomberg is committing a billion dollars. This is how maniacally\\n\\nthey want to remove Donald Trump from office.\\n\\nAnd the American people, now we're seeing the golden age. Freeman the other\\n\\nday in The Wall Street Journal said, we're seeing the golden age of the\\n\\nunderdog in America, the golden age of the striver in America, 9 percent\\n\\nincome growth if you don't have a high school degree, the first time that\\n\\nblue-collar workers over white-collar workers, workers over managers, blue-\\n\\ncollar over white-collar. And they see this in Tehran. They see this in Beirut.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Look at women. How about women?\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: They see this in Hong Kong, and they see it in Taipei.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes. And, certainly, in the U.S., you have got very strong jobs\\n\\nperformance as well, 50-year low on unemployment. Steve, it's great to see you.\\n\\n\\n\\nBANNON: Thank you, ma'am.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Steve Bannon joining us. We have got exclusive breaking news ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. It has been a news-breaking program. Congressman Devin Nunes will join me next with breaking news on the inspector general.\\n\\nAnd be sure to watch FOX Business Tuesday morning for my exclusive\\n\\ninterview with Jamie Dimon, the CEO and chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase. We\\n\\nwill get more on the economy and where it is now with the lead banker in\\n\\nthe country. More with Sunday Morning Futures when we come back.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back.\\n\\nAs the Senate prepares for the expected start of the impeachment trial this\\n\\nupcoming week, House GOP leaders are investigating the original whistle-\\n\\nblower complaint that started the inquiry in the first place.\\n\\nThe ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, sending\\n\\nthis letter to the intelligence community's inspector general, demanding\\n\\nanswers over inconsistencies that were found in the complaint.\\n\\nCongressman Nunes joins me now exclusively.\\n\\nCongressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for\\n\\njoining us.\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Great to be with you, Maria.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: I have got your letter in front of me. Tell us the crux.\\n\\n\\n\\nNUNES: Well, the bottom line is that Republicans asked back in the end of\\n\\nSeptember for the ICIG to provide e-mails, documentation about how it's\\n\\npossible that someone that only had secondhand information could possibly\\n\\nbe a whistle-blower, when it wasn't on the form.\\n\\nWhat we got back was essentially a non-answer answer at the early stages of\\n\\nOctober. At that time, we moved into impeachment in the House.\\n\\nAnd what I said at the time, even though the media largely ignored it, I\\n\\nsaid that we're not finished with the ICIG.\\n\\nLo and behold, the Democrats know that the ICIG is a major problem. You\\n\\nknow why? Because they haven't released his testimony. So he's the only\\n\\none. Of all the Star Chamber games that were played in the basement of the\\n\\nCapitol, with these secretive interviews, the only one that's not released\\n\\nis the one with the I.C. inspector general.\\n\\nThat is -- that's unacceptable. So what we're asking for here is -- because\\n\\nwhat he's claiming is essentially that we're just dumb, we made mistakes,\\n\\nit was a -- it was a huge mistake.\\n\\nThat's fine, if you want to claim incompetence, but you need to have the\\n\\ndocumentation, the evidence to prove that you were indeed incompetent,\\n\\nbecause it just doesn't pass the smell test. And it looks so much like\\n\\neverything else we have seen, from the Russia hoax to the Ukraine hoax that\\n\\nbecame the impeachment scam.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: This is unbelievable. So do you think you will get these answers?\\n\\n\\n\\nNUNES: Well, I think it's pertinent that the ICIG get these answers by\\n\\nFriday, because this is the guy who lit the fuse for this impeachment scam\\n\\nthat's now going to be on trial in the Senate.\\n\\nSo, if he wants to clear his name and prove that he is, in fact, and his\\n\\noffice is, in fact, incompetent, he needs to provide the evidence that he's\\n\\nincompetent.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, the whistle-blower apparently also worked for John\\n\\nBrennan, worked with John Brennan for a time.\\n\\nConnect the dots here, because you have been exposing the fraud by a cabal\\n\\nof individuals, whether under the leadership of John Brennan at CIA or Jim\\n\\nComey and the FBI.\\n\\nNUNES: Well, look, and that's the other problem here with the ICIG, is\\n\\nthis ICIG actually has connections, was a lawyer for some of the very\\n\\npeople that were involved in the FISA abuse scam.\\n\\nSo all of this becomes intertwined and related. And we need to get to the\\n\\nbottom of it.\\n\\nAnd, look, the ICIG, in theory, works for Congress. So why he wouldn't\\n\\nprovide evidence, which is really -- the I.G.s, that's their game, right?\\n\\nThat's what Horowitz proved is, they're very good at getting e-mails and\\n\\nevidence that exist within the bureaucracy.\\n\\nSo this is not hard for the ICIG to provide us all the documentation on\\n\\ntheir supposed stupidity.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Let me move on and ask you for some reaction to this David Kris\\n\\nnaming.\\n\\nI know you obviously have a lot of experience with this individual. The\\n\\nsurveillance court picks ex-DOJ leader David Kris to review FBI reforms. We\\n\\nknow that Christopher Wray's coming out with reforms.\\n\\nWe're going to show some of the headlines that David Kris wrote about you\\n\\nand about the Nunes memo, which, of course, as we know, was 100 percent\\n\\ntrue when you first came out with that Nunes memo, which was exposing the\\n\\nwrongdoing and the attempted coup to take down then candidate Trump, and\\n\\nthen President Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\nNUNES: Well, look, I don't -- I don't know this gentleman.\\n\\nI remember, at the time, there were conspiracy theorists out there who were\\n\\nsaying that -- they were accusing me essentially of committing crimes,\\n\\nwhen, in fact, it was the FBI and the dirty cops and the Clinton people\\n\\nthat were engaged in this conspiracy to try to take out the president of\\n\\nthe United States.\\n\\nSo the fact that, of all the people in the swamp -- I mean, granted, the\\n\\nswamp isn't very big, but there are several million people that live in\\n\\nthis area. This is the guy that you come up with, the guy that was accusing\\n\\nme of federal crimes, the guy that was defending the dirty cops at the FBI?\\n\\nI mean, look, that's why -- I said this last night in a tweet. The court\\n\\nmust be trying to abolish itself, because there is long-term damage. I\\n\\nmean, this is just another misstep.\\n\\nRemember, the judge from last year that now -- there was in charge of all\\n\\nthese FISAs, she claimed, at the end of the year, which was great, oh, my\\n\\nGod, there was a problem here and we need the FBI to do something.\\n\\nWell, that, in and of itself, was essentially a lie, or very close to a\\n\\nlie, because she knew from the House Republicans that there was a fraud on\\n\\nthe court.\\n\\nThey had more information and evidence than we did. And so now you have a\\n\\nnew judge who has been put in place, and he picks one of the guys that was\\n\\nessentially covering up for the dirty cops. You can't make it up.\\n\\nI guess we're just going to have to abolish this whole FISA system at this\\n\\npoint and try to build something new.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: What -- I mean...\\n\\n\\n\\nNUNES: I don't think the American people and Republicans in Congress -- if\\n\\nthis continues, you're going to have a continued concern amongst\\n\\nRepublicans and conservatives that there's really something wrong with the\\n\\nFBI.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nNUNES: And I don't think that there is. I think they're doing a really good job on a number of fronts.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\n\\n\\nNUNES: But this court is not acceptable.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Which is why this program has been calling for accountability\\n\\nin the face of all of this.\\n\\nCongressman, I know you will get it. Thank you so much. We will keep\\n\\nfollowing your work on this, Congressman Devin Nunes. We will be right back.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Senate impeachment trial set to begin soon, likely in the next\\n\\nweek, after Nancy Pelosi says that she will send the articles over this\\n\\nweek to the Senate. It is still unclear if the senators will vote to call witnesses.\\n\\nJoining me right now in this exclusive interview is Republican Senator Rick\\n\\nScott of Florida. Senator, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): Well, good morning.\\n\\nWell, Pelosi stopped -- is going to stop her circus, it looks like. And she\\n\\nclearly caved. We're going to follow the rules that we have in the Senate.\\n\\nAnd we're going to listen to both sides. And then we will make a decision\\n\\nwhether we have -- whether we have witnesses or not.\\n\\nBut I do -- I would like to hear from Biden, Hunter Biden, and find out --\\n\\nget to the bottom of that, because so much of this started with what he\\n\\ndid.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Nancy Pelosi is on another program this morning, and she said\\n\\nthat -- that the president violates the Constitution again and again.\\n\\nShe was asked, do you think it's possible that the House might have to file\\n\\nnew articles of impeachment? And she said, well, let's just see what the\\n\\nSenate does. It doesn't look like they're going to stop in terms of trying to come up\\n\\nwith even new articles, sir.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOTT: You know, what's frustrating is, I got elected a little over a year\\n\\nago. I got elected to come up and try to solve problems.\\n\\nI didn't get elected to have Nancy Pelosi play games, which is all she's\\n\\ndoing. We have -- we got a secure border, reduced the drug prices. We got\\n\\nissues. We got issues with Iran and North Korea and things like that.\\n\\nAnd she wants to spend all of her time on just trying to impeach this\\n\\npresident because she hates Donald Trump. She's hated Donald Trump, and a\\n\\nlot of the Democrats have, since the day he walked down that -- came down\\n\\nthat escalator. Why don't we get back to what people elected us to do and solve the\\n\\nproblems of this country?\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: How long are you expecting this trial to go? Do you think that\\n\\nyou will end up getting witnesses in there?\\n\\nAnd, if you don't, will you get blowback from Nancy Pelosi?\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOTT: Well, we're going to get blowback from Nancy Pelosi whatever we do.\\n\\nBut, look, the Democrats proved that the person didn't -- didn't do\\n\\nanything wrong. That's what they -- that's what they did. The only person\\n\\nthat's been transparent here is Donald Trump.\\n\\nI mean, he's -- he put out the transcript. They said, oh, the transcript is\\n\\nhorrible. So, I mean, I don't know what we're going to -- I don't know how\\n\\nyou're going to vote on something, when we can even find the crime that he\\n\\nsupposedly committed.\\n\\nI mean, this is high crimes and misdemeanors. What did he do? I mean, he's\\n\\ndefended this country. He -- and I still -- let's find out exactly what\\n\\nHunter Biden was doing. This all started with Hunter Biden.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.\\n\\nSo, you think that you would like to see, then, Hunter Biden come down and\\n\\ntestify? In terms of witnesses...\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOTT: Yes. Let's get the...\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOTT: Yes, let's get to the bottom of it. But, look, the bottom line is, we're going to do this.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOTT: We're going to follow the Senate rules. And we're not going to\\n\\nfollow Nancy Pelosi's rules. We're going to listen to both sides. Then we will make a decision.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Senator, thank you so much for joining us this morning, Senator\\n\\nRick Scott there.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOTT: Thanks, Maria.\\n\\n\\n\\nBARTIROMO: We will be watching. That will do it for Sunday Morning Futures. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Continue the conversation with me this week on Mornings With Maria on FOX Business.

{"original": "The disappearance of Vanessa Guillén, a 20-year-old soldier at the sprawling Texas Army base of Fort Hood last April, captured headlines across the world.\\n\\nAfter 10 torturous weeks and growing fears that another soldier who had sexually harassed her was involved, Guillén's dismembered, burned body parts were unearthed from a box by a river. That fellow soldier, her suspected killer, died by suicide as police inched closer to him.\\n\\nBut critics of the military installation vow there is much more to it. Last year, more than 30 soldiers associated with Fort Hood died – 11 were deemed suicides and five homicides.\\n\\nThe public outrage at Guillén's murder forced an independent review of the base, led by a five-member civilian team. The findings found a deficient climate at Fort Hood, as well as an ineffective implementation of the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) program that resulted in a pervasive lack of confidence, fear of retaliation, and significant underreporting of cases, particularly within the enlisted ranks.\\n\\nBut the review unveiled Tuesday also details deep concerns about the culture at the base, which has a population of over 60,000, including nearly 37,000 service members.\\n\\nThe murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillén shocked our conscience and brought attention to deeper problems, stated Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\\n\\nFORT HOOD SOLDIER'S DEATH MARKS 28TH AT TEXAS BASE THIS YEAR\\n\\nBeyond sexual harassment, the committee's findings also cast a disturbing light on the ad hoc approach to soldiers who do not show up for duty. They are automatically labeled Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL), with few resources dedicated to finding them or learning why they're missing. Guillén was listed AWOL even though her car keys and military identification were still inside the garrison, her car was in the parking lot, and there was no activity on her bank accounts.\\n\\nIn the civilian world, people are treated not as AWOL, but as missing persons. Our military is not second-class citizens, Natalie Khawam, the Guillens' attorney, told Fox News. This needs to be the year of the military. Who wants to join if cases are mishandled, and there is a real abuse of power and discretion?\\n\\nThe report also pointed to a lack of experience and high turnover within the ranks of the Criminal Investigation Department, leading to problems with launching sufficient investigations.\\n\\nAs it stands, there are more than 1,000 deserters wanted by the U.S. Army and it remains unclear explicitly what is being done to determine their fates. Ten months before Guillen disappeared, Pvt. Gregory Morales also vanished from Fort Hood. His body was unintentionally recovered a few miles from the base in June, during the search for Guillen. He had been listed as AWOL in August 2019 and later as a deserter.\\n\\nHowever, for his mother, Kim Wedel, her life in Oklahoma halted as she pleaded for assistance and answers from Fort Hood's Army Criminal Investigation Department (CID).\\n\\nIf any other business had this many glaring problems, leadership would be gone. Why did it take an investigation to see that the CID was understaffed and overwhelmed? There was a lack of response from CID, and they certainly didn't know what to do with me as a mom calling all the time, Wedel told Fox News.\\n\\nIf any other business had this many glaring problems, leadership would be gone. — Kim Wedel, mother of Army private who died under suspicious circumstances.\\n\\nThe Killeen Police Department is heading the investigation into Morales' death, in which foul play is suspected, according to local reports.\\n\\nThe Army didn't care enough to see there was a problem, Wedel asserted. I still haven't really heard from anyone down there. My son will never be at the forefront, and it is shocking how many parents like us are out there. People don't just disappear because they choose to.\\n\\nScott Weinhold, 24, a veteran of Fort Hood, went fishing with friends from the base in February 2019. He disappeared and his body was eventually found at Temple Lake Park along with that of his friend and fellow soldier. His death was ruled a drowning with hypothermia.\\n\\nThere was one survivor, but according to his New Hampshire-based mother, Jennifer Florin, she has never been given proper access to him and she is left to piece together her son's final hours.\\n\\nFlorin also claimed that there were threats of arrest from Fort Hood leaders during their initial search for their son, pertaining to being in waters belonging to the base.\\n\\nBut what was worse, Florin said, was having to buy her own flag, then learning that officials were not permitted to attend because of a back-up at the crematory. The family needed to return to the East Coast.\\n\\nIt was just one slap in the face after another; it was horrific, she said. I would like to see a complete investigation that isn't only focused on sexual trauma because there are a lot more issues at that base. It needs drastic oversight. We thought we had to be worried about sending our children to foreign soil, but it turns out we have to be more worried about them here.\\n\\nWe thought we had to be worried about sending our children to foreign soil, but it turns out we have to be more worried about them here. — Jennifer Florin, mother of dead Fort Hood veteran\\n\\nPENTAGON, LOCKHEED SOMEHOW BUILD 123 NEW F-35S IN 2020 AMID PANDEMIC\\n\\nIndeed, problems have plagued Fort Hood through multiple administrations, according to family members torn by grief and frustration.\\n\\nThe family of Fort Hood Army Cpl. Christopher Ferguson said his death in March 2007 is steeped in mystery and they are still in pain almost 14 years later.\\n\\nWe got a call one night that he had been drunk, and got into an accident and had fallen several stories from a balcony and landed on the top of his head, his sister, Christina McDonald recalled.\\n\\nOn the flight from Ohio, she envisioned her brother wrapped like a mummy in bandages at the hospital. Only he just looked as though he was sleeping, minimal scratches, no broken bones, she said.\\n\\nFerguson, who McDonald described as very straight-edged and never drank or smoked or got into trouble, was on life support and never regained consciousness. But nothing, she said, that she was being told about the off-base gathering at a fellow Fort Hood soldier's apartment that night ever made sense.\\n\\nShe noted that she later found her brother's camera, complete with photographs at the apartment that night of people who had vowed that they were never there. When she pushed for an independent medical examination, she was told it seemed more like her brother had been hit, and his brain was jarred.\\n\\nThe official cause of death was undetermined but ruled an accident years later, McDonald said. She said there is neither closure nor clarity.\\n\\nBut victims and skeptics of the installation's leadership have long bemoaned that for years, answers and transparency were challenging to come by.\\n\\nThat same year, 2007, 20-year-old Spc. Kamisha Block deployed to Iraq with a military police unit from Fort Hood, but was shot and killed just weeks later by Staff Sgt. Paul Brandon Norris. Block's younger sister Shonta said he later killed himself.\\n\\nBoth Block and Norris were members of the 401st Military Police Company and believed to have been in a secret relationship; it was prohibited under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But it turned tragic in a war zone more than 7,000 miles away.\\n\\nAt the time, the distraught Block family – at their home in Vidor, Texas – were informed that Block died from a friendly fire gunshot through the heart. Yet after viewing the body at a local funeral home, Shonta questioned the official cause of death.\\n\\nWhen I saw her, I said, 'Mom, that's not her hair' – there was a fake bun glued to her head. Her head had been blown out at the back, Shonta told Fox News, stressing that the body showed multiple bullet wounds rather than only one, as they had been informed. My family never got answers.\\n\\nWith her advocacy, the Army re-opened the case in 2018 to investigate an allegation that someone was ordered to destroy medical records related to the case. It was closed again in 2020, on the grounds that no credible information was found to substantiate the allegations.\\n\\nThe Army opened it and handed it right back to CID, Shonta lamented.\\n\\nHowever, change could be coming.\\n\\nSince the review, McCarthy has ordered the firing, suspension, or re-assignment of 14 of Fort Hood's senior leadership – a number of whom were part of CID. It marks one of the most significant punitive actions ever executed by the service.\\n\\nThe independent committee also put forth 70 recommendations relating to areas including SHARP; Fort Hood Criminal Investigation Command (CID); missing Soldier protocols; and the installation's crime prevention and public relations efforts.\\n\\nIn response to the findings of the independent review, the Secretary of the Army signed a directive clarifying expectations and responsibilities of unit commanders and Army law enforcement authorities focused on the first 48 hours after a Soldier fails to report for duty, an Army spokesperson told Fox News. When one of our teammates does not report for duty, we now change their duty status to 'absent-unknown' and take immediate action to find them.\\n\\nWhen one of our teammates does not report for duty, we now change their duty status to 'absent-unknown' and take immediate action to find them. — Army spokesperson\\n\\nThe spokesperson also emphasized that the challenges at Fort Hood forced us to take a critical look at our systems, our policies, and ourselves.\\n\\nWhile the independent review focused on the command climate and culture at Fort Hood, the findings contained in the committee's report impact the entire Army and more than 1.2 million Soldiers, the representative continued. In response, we created the People First Task Force to analyze the findings and recommendations in the report, develop a plan of action to address issues identified by the committee, and reevaluate current policy and programs.\\n\\nThe Task Force will present its recommendations to Army leadership as quickly as possible for Army senior leaders' review and implementation.\\n\\nUnder McCarthy's direction, the military also is running its own investigation into Fort Hood, and further disciplinary measures could be taken.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nHowever, many soldiers and families connected to Fort Hood told Fox News that the personnel changes were merely cosmetic, and they feared business as usual when the spotlight faded.\\n\\nJennifer Norris, an Air Force veteran and military crime analyst who has focused on Fort Hood issues since 2016, said in order to look forward, one also must look back.\\n\\nThe deaths ruled a suicide – they need to be investigated. Why did they take their lives? Were those deaths properly investigated? Was it really a suicide, or was it a murder? Everything needs to be questioned, she added.

{"original": "As a Republican who began his volunteer activities in Georgia in the 1960 Richard Nixon-Henry Cabot Lodge presidential campaign (I was in high school and there was such a small Georgia GOP then that every volunteer was welcome) I think it is necessary to have the courage to face the depth and scale of Tuesday's disaster in the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia won by Democrats.\\n\\nMany Republicans will try to avoid the scale of Tuesday's defeat, but that would be an enormous mistake.\\n\\nEverything we said about how important these runoff elections were (the most consequential in history) and the impact of losing (a profound shift in power giving a narrow Senate majority to Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and his fellow Democrats) was true.\\n\\nFOX NEWS PROJECTS OSSOFF AS WINNER OF GEORGIA RUNOFF ELECTIONS OVER PURDUE\\n\\nThe two vital runoffs have now been lost, with the defeat of Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue at the hands of Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\\n\\nThis double victory will be an enormous morale boost and a real increase in power for the Washington Democrats.\\n\\nSo, what lessons must we learn from this disaster of the first order?\\n\\nWe should look at the series of often unrelated events and activities that made Republican victories in these vital Senate races much more difficult.\\n\\nFirst, we should acknowledge the remarkable job Democrat Stacey Abrams has done in building a powerful first-class voting machine in Georgia (making herself the most likely next governor). She has spent two full years since losing her own race for governor raising money nationally and building an organization that can turn out the vote on an unprecedented scale.\\n\\nAbrams was a major factor in carrying Georgia for Joe Biden in the presidential election and in electing the two Democrats in the Senate runoffs. By force of personality and a lot of hard work, she is becoming a major player. Republicans must study her and what she has achieved and figure out how to overmatch it.\\n\\nThen there is the polarization of Americans into pro -and anti-Trump factions. This has such intensity that what would have normally been powerful attacks against Democratic Senate candidates Ossoff and Warnock were simply ignored or shrugged off by their polarized supporters.\\n\\nI was really surprised at how little impact descriptions of Warnock's radicalism had on voters who normally would have been appalled at some of his positions. Because of polarization they had picked their team and they resented, rather than listened to, negative information about their side. This eliminated most of the argumentative side of campaigning and reduced the opportunity to have a campaign dialogue.\\n\\nThe civil war between Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the rest of the Republican Party, including President Trump, clearly had a distracting impact.\\n\\nPresident Trump's hour-long argument with Raffensperger alleging voter fraud in the presidential race in Georgia further weakened Republican voter enthusiasm, as people couldn't figure out what was going on or who to believe.\\n\\nThese Senate runoffs were so vital that everything should have been subordinated to winning the two races. This clearly was not done. The bitterness on both sides of the Kemp-Raffensperger versus Trump fight further weakened the GOP at a crucial moment. Perhaps the most devastating blow was the idiotic push by some for Republicans to boycott the Senate runoffs.\\n\\nThe failure of President Trump and Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to coordinate what they would do on the $2,000-per-person coronavirus stimulus proposal disappointed Trump's populist voters and left Sens. Perdue and Loeffler in difficult positions.\\n\\nI warned at the time that trying clever parliamentary maneuvers would simply fail to satisfy the Republican base. As public policy the $2,000-per-person grant is a bad idea. However, as political policy in the most important runoffs in American history, once President Trump staked out a pro-$2,000 policy the Senate GOP should have voted on it and given Sens. Loeffler and Perdue a chance to prove to economic populists that they were on their side.\\n\\nFurther, there was a failure to follow up on President Trump's success with Latino voters and win the same share for the two senators (this would almost have been enough of a difference to decide the two runoffs).\\n\\nIn November, President Trump got a higher percentage of minority votes than any Republican in 60 years. The Georgia GOP should have spent far more resources on the Latino and Asian American votes. This opportunity would have included highlighting the election of the largest number of Republican women and minority House members in history.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nThe decision by the Loeffler and Perdue campaigns to run almost entirely negative ads was a mistake. (The complaints I received about the ads from many pro-Republican sources were a warning that something was not working).\\n\\nAs my daughter, Jackie Cushman, said, this reliance on negative ads gave the appearance that Perdue and Loeffler weren't running for anything but only against their opponents. This isn't a great position for any campaign — especially for incumbents.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Democrats had some positive ads designed to communicate warm and caring personalities. All too many of our consultants have grown stale and only want to repeat things that used to work. I have heard from several people in Georgia who said that the people running the Republican campaigns simply wouldn't hear suggestions to try different, more positive messages.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nFinally, there is the failure to address or clean up the allegations of a corrupt election process that arose from the Nov. 3 election. This failure is the most amazing thing I have seen in six decades of Republican politics. Despite serious concerns from many Georgians, Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Raffensperger took the position that everything was fine — or simply unfixable. This did nothing to increase public trust or credibility.\\n\\nThis is a brief introduction to what should be a much longer and more detailed inquest. These two Senate races were winnable. But all too many of the participants, supporters, and major players had agendas that put the GOP victory at risk. The result is a nightmare from which we will spend years recovering.\\n\\nTo read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich's commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM NEWT GINGRICH"}
{"original": "As House Democrats move to impeach a president who leaves office in eight days, the repercussions of the Capitol riot are fueling a debate over free speech, social media, and cancel culture.\\n\\nIt's impossible not to be shaken by the new reporting and videos of what happened last Wednesday, which shows how close we came to a devastating massacre by armed terrorists determined to kill lawmakers and even the vice president. The sight of a Capitol policeman being beaten with an American flag, and a brave officer who led a mob away from the Senate chamber, is beyond revolting.\\n\\nThe criticism of President Trump's conduct from the left and right, regardless of whether impeachment makes sense as Joe Biden prepares to take office, is totally understandable.\\n\\nWHY SOME TRUMP LOYALISTS ARE JUMPING SHIP AFTER THE CAPITOL RIOT\\n\\nBut whether Twitter should be permanently barring Trump, or companies should be pressured not to hire anyone associated with him, are much more difficult questions.\\n\\nMost journalists are celebrating the Twitter ban (and the indeterminate Facebook ban) as an unalloyed triumph over a president they have been battling for four years. To even raise a question about it, as I have learned, is to be yelled at as defending someone who incited a terrorist attack.\\n\\nBut while the temporary bans were more defensible, journalists above all should be concerned about free speech. Is Jack Dorsey's company barring private citizen Trump from tweeting because he may organize another insurrection, or as payback against a president who tried to eliminate legal immunity for social media giants?\\n\\nIs it just a coincidence that Twitter is dumping Trump, who generated so much traffic and revenue, just as the Democrats are about to take over the White House and Congress?\\n\\nAnd that brings us to Twitter's reputation. Conservatives have long complained about bias by Twitter and its Silicon Valley brethren, especially during the campaign, when tweets by Trump and his campaign and allies were blocked or labeled but no action ever seems to be taken against prominent Democrats.\\n\\nYes, these are private companies, so there's no First Amendment issue, but social media platforms have become the new public square. They benefit from federal regulation. Choking off voices has serious consequences, and if it was left-wingers being exiled, I suspect you'd see far more journalistic outrage.\\n\\nHow on earth does Twitter justify banning Trump for incitement, but taking no action against the thousands of users who said Hang Mike Pence, allowing it to become a trending topic? Or allowing foreign autocrats to spew lies and threats?\\n\\nEqually questionable is how tech rivals pulled the plug on Parler, which became a conservative haven by billing itself as an alternative free-speech platform.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not defending the threatening messages that were allowed to proliferate on Parler, like this one: Prepare Our weapons, and then go get 'em. Let's hunt down these cowards like the Traitors that each of them are. This includes, RINOs, Dems and Tech Execs.\\n\\nBut Parler's CEO says his policy was to attempt to remove such violent posts. And when Apple, Google, and Amazon pulled the digital rug out from under Parler -- in some cases giving the firm 24 hours to clean up its act -- it felt like a foregone conclusion. Chief executive John Matze says this is a case of Big Tech squashing the competition.\\n\\nElsewhere in the corporate world, the PGA has pulled its 2022 championship from Trump's New Jersey course, and a slew of companies say they won't donate to Republicans who challenged the electoral results. That's their right; they can vote with their wallets.\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\\n\\nBut it goes further when the Lincoln Project says it will spend big bucks on a campaign targeting companies that backed Trump and certain Republicans, even law firms that represented them.\\n\\nForbes' editor, Randall Lane, issued a public warning marked by photos of Kellyanne Conway, Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Kayleigh McEnany: Hire any of Trump's fellow fabulists above, and Forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie. We're going to scrutinize, double-check, investigate with the same skepticism we'd approach a Trump tweet.\\n\\nPoliticians are fair game, they put themselves in the arena and their reputations at risk.\\n\\nBut what if you're an administrative assistant at a company whose PAC made political donations, or a paralegal at a law firm where only a couple of the partners did work for Republicans? This could get pretty ugly.\\n\\nThe point about these debates on free speech and political retaliation is that things look very different when the target is people on your side. I fully believe in accountability for those associated with last week's appalling attack on American democracy. But there's the potential for an awful lot of collateral damage here."}

In the six years since, the price has jumped to $82,191.\\n\\nThe think tank's analysis has come into question however, with multiple outlets pushing back on its numbers and methodology.\\n\\nThe new figure by the CIS estimates what it takes to protect the border, educate, house and feed illegal immigrants and makes the assumption they will spend a lifetime on various welfare programs.\\n\\nDOUG SCHOEN: TRUMP, PELOSI AND SCHUMER - WE NEED COMPROMISE, NOT POLITICAL POSTURING\\n\\nThis estimate means that for every 100,000 illegal immigrants that are stopped from crossing the border, it would save taxpayers $8.2 billion over the illegal immigrants' lifetimes, the report states.\\n\\nThe report also concludes that a southern border wall between the U.S. and Mexico would only have to stop four percent of undocumented migrants, or about 60,000 over the next 10 years, to recoup the cost of President Trump's $5 billion funding ask.\\n\\nAlmost everyone has come up with a different price tag on the cost of illegal immigration.\\n\\nPresident Trump, for example, has touted several different estimates.\\n\\nDuring a Cabinet meeting in late December, Trump put the price of illegal immigration as high as $275 billion.\\n\\nI've heard numbers as high as $275 billion we lose on illegal immigrants, he said. The $5, $5.6 billion approve by the House is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem.\\n\\nIn early December, Trump said illegal immigration cost $250 billion per year. On Dec. 18, he said it was more than $250 billion per year. That number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, illegal immigration cost our nation $275 billion a year.\\n\\nFAMILIES OF AMERICANS KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TAKE ISSUE WITH CLAIM TRUMP IS 'MANUFACTURING A CRISIS'\\n\\nMeg Wiehe, deputy director at the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, told NBC News that Trump's figure sounds extraordinarily high to me.\\n\\nDavid Dyssegaard Kallick, deputy director of the nonpartisan Fiscal Policy Institute, was more blunt, calling the numbers frankly absurd.\\n\\nCIS research director Steven Camarota says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with Mexico will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe range of reasonable assumption indicated that a wall would not have to come close to being anywhere near 100 percent effective to pay for itself, he wrote. This would be true even if a wall cost twice as much. A wall that is only partially effective could pay for itself by offsetting the cost that otherwise successful illegal crossers would create."}
{"original": "FOX Business anchor Maria Bartiromo argued on Monday that the suspension of upstart social media platform Parler by Amazon, Apple and Google following Wednesday's U.S. Capitol riot could be collusion and a coordinated effort to put a competitor out of business.\\n\\nSpeaking on America's Newsroom on Monday, the morning after Amazon Web Services (AWS) suspended Parler, Bartiromo called the bans by Big Tech a coordinated attack against the alternative social media platform and free speech.\\n\\nParler went down early Monday following AWS' decision to suspend Parler from its cloud hosting service.\\n\\nAmazon says the move was made for violating AWS' terms of services by failing to effectively deal with a steady increase in violent content, according to an email by an AWS Trust and Safety team to Parler, seen by Reuters. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the letter was authentic.\\n\\nDuring an interview on Mornings with Maria on Monday, CEO John Matze told users to hold on and come back as the company figures out how to move forward.\\n\\nWe're going to figure this out, Matze said, adding that it's going to be devastating to our business, our model [and] our potential to raise future capital.\\n\\nOn Monday, Bartiromo acknowledged the suspensions will have devastating consequences for Parler.\\n\\nIf you're not on the app store, a company like Parler literally can go out of business, she said, noting that in order to grow, they need you to buy the app on the app store.\\n\\nSo you are looking at a coordinated effort across social media to pretty much put this company out of business, she added.\\n\\nAPPLE AND GOOGLE SUSPEND PARLER FROM THEIR APP STORES\\n\\nMatze also told Bartiromo on Monday that at this point we may even have to go as far as buying and building our own data centers and buying up our own servers if we need to get back on the Internet.\\n\\nBut there's still risk involved in that given what vendors are doing and the extent they're going to get rid of us, he continued.\\n\\nHe argued that Amazon, Apple and Google's suspension of his social media platform is a pretty prime example of antitrust, adding that he believes Big Tech is using the violence at the Capitol as an excuse to squash their first real competitor.\\n\\nSpeaking on Sunday Morning Futures the day before, Matze also called the moves to suspend his app obvious collusion and an effort to stifle free speech and competition in the marketplace.\\n\\nGoogle suspended Parler from its app store Friday due to a failure to moderate egregious content posted by users related to the violent siege on Capitol Hill last week.\\n\\nParler is facing criticism over Wednesday's riot that saw supporters of President Trump storm into the U.S. Capitol, attack police, vandalize the building and steal items.\\n\\nScreenshots taken from Parler and shared on other social media platforms appear to show Parler users openly discussing plans for violence at the rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol, including bringing weapons and imagining how they would wield them against their political opponents.\\n\\nApple also suspended Parler from its App Store even as it surged to the No. 1 spot in the free apps section.\\n\\nAn Apple spokesperson said in a statement to FOX Business, We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity.\\n\\nParler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety, the statement continued. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues.\\n\\nBartiromo said she finds it hard to believe that it was something happening on Parler that had anything to do with the disaster that happened on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that attacked our democracy and the breach of the Capitol.\\n\\nShe pointed to Hang Mike Pence trending on Twitter on Friday night, with about 14,000 tweets after the social media platform banned Trump due to the risk of further incitement of violence, according to reports.\\n\\nBartiromo then asked, How do you make the case that there was violence on Parler and not on all these other sites?\\n\\nOn Sunday, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called for a racketeering investigation following Amazon, Apple and Google's decisions to suspend Parler.\\n\\nDuring an interview on Sunday Morning Futures Nunes said Amazon, Apple and Google's suspension of Parler is clearly a violation' of antitrust, civil rights and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which is a federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization.\\n\\nI don't know where the hell the Department of Justice is at right now or the FBI, the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said on Sunday.\\n\\nThe next day, speaking on America's Newsroom, Bartiromo agreed with Nunes saying, This has to be something that the Department of Justice and the FBI would look at.\\n\\nBartiromo also agreed with Matze on Monday saying that Big Tech's suspension of Parler is a perfect example of antitrust abuse given the fact that these companies have become so dominant that they are able to just wipe out another company [and] put them out of business.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAn FBI spokesperson told Fox News, Per our usual policy, the FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.

{"original": "Shame on Mitt Romney. Publishing an ad hominem attack on President Trump in The Washington Post on the cusp of occupying a Senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the Oval Office was dishonorable. In addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about Romney: that he is not to be trusted.\\n\\nYou have to ask, what was the senator-elect from Utah thinking? That by proclaiming that President Trump had not risen to the mantle of the office Romney would protect himself from a Trumpian taint? To what end? It's hard to imagine.\\n\\nIt is not as though the wealthy former private equity mogul needs to secure a future career as a GOP-turncoat talking head, as ex-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., may hope to become. Last year, anti-Trumper Flake met with MSNBC President Phil Griffin and CNN's chief Jeff Zucker, sparking speculation that post-Senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.\\n\\nLIZ PEEK: LET'S LOOK PAST THE LIBERAL MEDIA GLOOM FACTORY AND CELEBRATE THE GOOD NEWS THIS CHRISTMAS\\n\\nThat's not Romney's situation. Could it be that Romney wants to be at the ready in case the impeachment abyss opens up and consumes the president … and Vice President Mike Pence at the same time? Does he think he'll be the chosen favorite in case GOP leaders have to go to their bench? It isn't going to happen.\\n\\nAnd especially after writing the anti-Trump op-ed. Republicans could change their minds, but at the moment a startling 89 percent support the president, according to a Gallup Poll.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAfter his defeat in 2012 and in the run-up to the next election, Romney made the rounds of important Republican funders, looking to test their support for a re-run. I spoke to some of those folks as the 2016 contest got underway. The near-universal consensus: he had had his shot.\\n\\nThat isn't to say that many Republican voters don't regret Romney's defeat. The former Massachusetts governor would have been a much better president than Barack Obama, given his considerable management expertise and profound understanding of the economy.\\n\\nAlso, Romney had foreign policy chops. His comments about Russia being the nation's biggest threat proved prescient, even as he was mocked by President Obama, who thought he knew better.\\n\\nBut, Romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted. Millions of Americans were fed up with a globalist agenda, tired of being told the U.S. had run out of gas, furious over the absurdities of political correctness – they wanted a change, and they elected Donald Trump.\\n\\nRomney would not have pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. He would have been too polite to throw over the Iran nuke deal, or to confront the Chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our NATO allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put America first.\\n\\nIn his op-ed in The Washington Post, Romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of Trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align U.S. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on China's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.\\n\\nBut would Mitt have done those things? Would he have stood behind Supreme Court nominee (and now justice) Brett Kavanaugh while the liberal media slimed his reputation and judged him guilty of sins allegedly committed decades earlier on the flimsiest of evidence?\\n\\nNo, we saw during his 2012 campaign that Romney did not have the steel to go the distance. After he trounced Obama in the first debate between the two, Romney failed to press his advantage and the second debate was a disaster for him.\\n\\nRomney refused to go after Obama on the shameful lies about the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, wouldn't challenge the president on his handling of the auto industry meltdown and allowed Democrats to paint him as anti-female.\\n\\nMitt Romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that American voters elected Donald Trump.\\n\\nIf he couldn't stand up to Obama, how would Romney have fared with Chinese President Xi Jinping?\\n\\nBut there is a more profound reason that Romney lost to Obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. While President Trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), Romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. Maybe he thought American voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.\\n\\nMitt Romney helped create or rebuild great companies like Staples, Sealy (the mattress firm) and the Sports Authority, creating wealth not only for his firm Bain Capital but also for investors. Those businesses also created thousands of jobs. Romney's firm also had some clunkers, but for the most part he and his partners supplied capital to entrepreneurs who took that funding and created solid and enduring companies.\\n\\nThat is a record to be proud of, but you would never have known that from Romney's presidential campaign. Running from your past is smart if your history is dishonorable; otherwise, it is dishonest.\\n\\nMitt Romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that American voters elected Donald Trump. He is not alone. There are reasons why many Republicans are wary of too close an association with the president, and Romney's op-ed detailed many of those.\\n\\nBut a more honorable approach for the newly elected senator would have been to become a leader in his caucus, to attempt to work with and advise the president by becoming a trusted voice, and to serve the American voter by making this presidency as successful as possible.\\n\\nI am disappointed that Romney chose to do otherwise.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LIZ PEEK"}

Had they honored the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detainer this would never have happened, Wolf said on Fox & Friends. So if they'd cooperated with ICE officials, the individual would never have been let out, wouldn't have committed this crime and we wouldn't even be talking about this.\\n\\nNYC'S SANCTUARY POLICY UNDER FIRE AFTER FREED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ALLEGEDLY MURDERS 92-YEAR-OLD\\n\\nSo if they would just cooperate in the first place it wouldn't even be an issue, he said.\\n\\nReeaz Khan, an illegal Guyanese immigrant, is accused of attacking Maria Fuertes as she walked home on Jan. 6. Fuertes was reportedly found at 2 a.m. in 32-degree weather and near death on a sidewalk with her clothes pulled above her waist. She was taken to a hospital, where she died from injuries that included a broken spine, according to The New York Post. The Post cited law enforcement sources who said she had been sexually assaulted and strangled.\\n\\nThe case has again highlighted the dangers of sanctuary city policies in which local jurisdictions refuse to comply with detainers issued by federal immigration authorities. Those detainers are requests that ICE be alerted when an illegal immigrant is about to be released from custody so that they can be transferred to ICE custody and go through deportation proceedings.\\n\\nICE had issued a federal immigration detainer on Khan in November when he was previously arrested on assault and weapons charges. The NYPD ignored the detainer and Khan was released.

The day our police ask for immigration status is the day people stop reporting crimes & sharing information. It's the day we stop being the safest big city in America. We won't let that happen.\\n\\nBut Wolf brushed off that claim, saying that sanctuary city policies put communities and law enforcement in danger.\\n\\nWhat this does, the only sanctuary it provides is to criminals, he said. It makes those communities less safe, it also makes ICE and law enforcement officials less safe so instead of picking up an individual in a confined jail setting, they have to go into communities to knock on doors and the like.\\n\\nIt's very hypocritical for them to say that, if they would just have honored the ICE detainer to begin with, we wouldn't even be talking about this, he said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nEarlier, Wolf faulted a number of laws passed by liberal lawmakers in New York that he said made things harder for law enforcement.\\n\\nAmong them, he cited New York State's Green Light Law, which grants driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, but also limits the amount of information that immigration authorities can get from Department of Motor Vehicles. Wolf said that authorities use that information every day to build cases against criminals and terrorists.\\n\\nIt's very, very dangerous once jurisdictions and politicians put politics above public safety, he said. We're trying to do everything we can to battle that, but it is an uphill battle."}

I didn't have any reason to leave my party in 2010. I was a Republican who ran a write-in campaign and I was successful. But I will tell you, if the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me.\\n\\nMurkowski first drew the disdain of the president when she, along with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me., came out in opposition to filling the vacancy left by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg less than two months before the presidential election.\\n\\nMurkowski said that while there may have been many, many, many, many good Americans who came to Washington, D.C., because they felt strongly in support of this president, she said Trump's refusal to accept the presidential results incited supporters to storm the Capitol.\\n\\nI will attribute it to the president, she said. Even after his vice president told him that morning, 'I do not have the constitutional authority to do what you have asked me to do. I cannot do it. I have to protect and uphold the Constitution.' Even after the vice president told President Trump that, he still told his supporters to fight. How are they supposed to take that? It's an order from the president. And so that's what they did.

He says let's make a deal. They did not turn down wall for the bridge, that's not that story line. I tried to see if we could open up the government for limited period of time to negotiate a deal and the president says, let's make a deal, then open up the government.\\n\\nNancy Pelosi says, even if you open up the government, I wouldn't fund a wall. So, that's why I'm depressed. You know, there's not much talk about what she said. She's telling the president, even if you open up the government, I'm not going to do a deal on the wall. And that's a nonstarter for the president.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, I don't mean in any way to cast aspersions on the president or Nancy Pelosi, but do you know one of the definitions of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Yes.\\n\\nWALLACE: What's going to go on? President says make a deal, the Democrats say not funding for the wall. Not saying it's right or wrong --\\n\\nGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: -- but what happens?\\n\\nGRAHAM: Well, I think it just plays out. What bothers me so much is that your next guests, Chris Coons, a great guy. We could sit down to make a deal with him wall, plus DACA, wall plus TPS. Every Democrat that I've worked with for about ten years now has agreed to funding for barriers/walls on Obama's watch, on Bush's watch, and all of a sudden, it's a bad thing on Trump's watch.\\n\\nIt really does perplex me how you expect this to end when you tell the president of the United States, you get $1 for a wall when in the past Democrats have appropriated billions for the wall. What are we supposed to do? Just give in? He's not going to give in.\\n\\nWALLACE: He's not going to give in.\\n\\nHe said in a tweet, I believe it was yesterday, that he has a plan. What's the plan?\\n\\nGRAHAM: The plan is to do a deal. He is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status.\\n\\nWALLACE: Those are temporary protected status.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Let me just state, temporary protected status.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: People who came in from disasters.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Thank you.\\n\\nYes, there are about 400,000. They are going to lose their legal status soon. He's willing to extend that. The DACA recipients, they are all tied up in court but I think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable if you could get wall funding.\\n\\nI don't want to speak for the president. I don't want to lock him in, but I'm confident what I just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the White House. And a lot of Democrats -- and I'm just so frustrated -- we can't get in a room and hammer it out.\\n\\nWALLACE: Now, some White House officials it's been reported are now talking about well, maybe the president will be using his State of the Union speech to make this case.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: That's 16 days from now. Some White House officials are talking about this extending into February.\\n\\nHow much damage does that two of this government shutdown goes on for weeks, even into next month?\\n\\nGRAHAM: Less damage than if we don't fix a broken immigration system. You've got to bad choices here. Continue to stalemate and see parts of the government shutdown, it will be inconvenient and it can create problems. Into the federal workforce, I'm sorry you caught up in this mess. But the real damage is people coming across the border, selling drugs, killing Americans, that needs to come to an end. So, the real damage is a broken border compared to a partial shutdown.\\n\\nThe president is not going to give in. No wall, no deal, but he's ready to deal. And your next guest I am sure would provide funding for a barrier where it made sense if he could get something for it.\\n\\nWALLACE: You have been one of the loudest voices among Republicans urging the president to declare a national emergency. I have two questions.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: One, why doesn't he just go ahead and do that? He seems to think that's a way out of this.\\n\\nSecondly, there are a lot of your GOP colleagues who say that would be a terrible precedent because someday, there's going to be a Democratic president and they're going to say, well, you know what, it's a national emergency, so let's fund climate change. It's going to be a national emergency, so let's fund income inequality.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Let's start with the president. I ask him, Mr. President if you want to go down the emergency path, I stand with you. He said just 30 minutes ago, that's my last option. I think the legislative route is the best way to go, let's make a deal, but I will do it if I have to.\\n\\nSo, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. I am going to support him. Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.\\n\\nBut I think the legislative path is just about shut off because Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House, said, even if you open up the government, I will give you $1 for the wall. As long as that's the case, we are never going to get a legislative package no matter what the Senate does.\\n\\nWALLACE: I want to just pursue this emergency option one more time because in 2014, President Obama used his executive powers to try and protect 5 million immigrants, and here's what you said at the time.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nGRAHAM: This is wrong, it's a responsible and will do damage to our efforts to fix a broken immigration system. This is a tremendous presidential overreach.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: So, why was that an overreach for President Obama then but not for President Trump now?\\n\\nGRAHAM: Well, what President Obama did, he didn't declare a national emergency about the DACA recipients. He took his power to pardon an individual or a smaller group and applied it to 1.8 million people. Ever president -- not every, a lot of presidents have declared emergencies. After 9/11, we did and they have taken money and powers to deal with a national emergency.\\n\\nI think there is a crisis at the border. I think it fits the definition of a national emergency. It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option.\\n\\nHow do you negotiate with the speaker of the House when she tells you even if you open up the government are not going to give you but $1 for the wall? So, until that changes, there's not much left except the national emergency approach.\\n\\nAnd to my Republican colleagues: Stand behind the president as this is his last option. He ran on this as a centerpiece of his presidency, and it is a crisis. And if you don't see the crisis, you are not looking very hard.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK, I want to switch subjects. The New York Times now reports that after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, that the bureau opened up a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was working on behalf of the Russians. One, did you know about that? Two, what do you think -- I have to say, it's an astonishing idea.\\n\\nThe FBI, the bureau investigating whether the president was a Russian agent.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Well, number one, that story came from somebody who leaked it with an agenda. So I'd like to know who leaked it because they have an agenda not very friendly to President Trump and I for one don't trust what I read in The New York Times.\\n\\nHaving said all that, I'm going to ask the FBI director, was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the Russians? I find it astonishing and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the FBI, McCabe and that crowd. I don't trust them as far as I throw them.\\n\\nSo, if this really did happen, Congress needs to know about it and what I want to do is make sure how could the FBI do that? What kind of checks and balances are there?\\n\\nWALLACE: Let me -- you have a lot of clout in asking the FBI questions because you're the new chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- congratulations, Mr. Chairman.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Thank you.\\n\\nWALLACE: And your committee is going to begin holding confirmation hearings this week on the president's nomination of William Barr to be the new attorney general. What do you intend to ask him about the special counsel investigation, and whether or not the special counsel is going to be allowed to finish his investigation and issue a full, unedited report to Congress?\\n\\nGRAHAM: I'm going to ask him, do you see any reason to fire Mr. Mueller based on what you know now for cause? Do you trust Mr. Mueller to be fair to the president of a country? Will you make sure he can finish his job? If you get the report, will you be as transparent as possible?\\n\\nI've asked him those questions, and I'm very comfortable with those answers. So, I think you'd be a great attorney general, great job by the president to pick Mr. Barr. I see no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but that would be up to Mr. Mueller to make his report to attorney general and he soon will I hope.\\n\\nWALLACE: Another question for the new chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week after cancer surgery, for the first time, astonishingly, in her quarter-century on the court, missed oral arguments. Now, we all wish her a speedy recovery, the doctors say that she is cancer-free. But there are reports for the White House has begun reviewing a possible short list of candidates to replace her.\\n\\nAs the chair of the committee that would vote on a replacement, have you given any thought how you'd prevent this from becoming a political circus?\\n\\nGRAHAM: Well, number one, I wish her well and hope she recovers and continues to serve for many years. But here's what will happen if there's a vacancy, no matter from the liberal wing of the court, there'd be a lot of pushback from the left.\\n\\nBut my Democratic colleagues felt when they were in charge, we should confirm judges by majority vote. They changed the rules to accommodate President Obama. They tried to stack the court. They never thought Clinton would lose.\\n\\nSo, what you're going to have is Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer's desire to stack the court on their Democratic watch has come back to haunt them.\\n\\nIf there is an opening, whether it's Ginsburg or anybody else, I will urge the president to nominate a qualified conservative and hopefully those people will get through, that person will get through and I expect it to be along party lines.\\n\\nAnd this is what happens when you change the rules. This has come back to bite them. I predicted it would, and we'll see.\\n\\nI hope Justice Ginsburg serves for a long time, but there's an opening on this court, I'm going to be hell-bent to put a conservative to replace whoever steps down for whatever reason.\\n\\nWALLACE: And just, finally, and I got about 30 seconds left, if you got Donald Trump -- and again, this is if -- you have Donald Trump replacing a liberal icon like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, isn't that a formula for -- I mean, doesn't that make the Kavanaugh hearings look like a tea party?\\n\\nGRAHAM: They should have thought of that before they changed the rules. They try to destroy conservative judges. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan understanding what I was getting. So this decision by Reid and Schumer may come back to haunt them, but I am dead set on making sure it is a conservative nominee.\\n\\nAnd elections have consequences. The rules of the Senate were changed not by me, by them, and we had to do it on the Supreme Court because they would not give us any votes to nominate anybody and Kavanaugh was a fine man, they tried to destroy him. All this is going to come back to haunt them one day.\\n\\nWALLACE: Yes, let me just really quickly explained that when the Democrats with the majority, Majority Leader Harry Reid changed it for judicial nominees short of the Supreme Court and for cabinet appointees.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: It went from the 60-vote margin to 51, and then the Republicans did it for the Supreme Court.\\n\\nSenator Graham, thank you. Thanks for your time.\\n\\nGRAHAM: Can I just say one last thing?\\n\\nWALLACE: Yes, sir.\\n\\nGRAHAM: One last thing. We don't need -- we don't need one Democrat to replace a liberal justice. And the reason that's the case is because of what Harry Reid did. What he set in motion. Thank you.\\n\\nWALLACE: Always good to speak with you, sir.\\n\\nOK. I guess you think it was OK to speak with us.\\n\\nUp next, Democrats challenge the president to reopen the government and discuss border security measures both sides can agree on. Democratic Senator Chris Coons joins us next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: These days, Donald Trump is facing the toughest set of challenges of his presidency -- the government shutdown, the new Democratic majority in the House and the special counsel's Russia probe that appears to be close to wrapping up.\\n\\nJoining us now from Delaware, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.\\n\\nSenator, welcome back to FOX News Sunday.\\n\\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE: Thanks, Chris. Good morning.\\n\\nWALLACE: House Speaker Pelosi says that the border wall is immoral and that she won't give -- I guess she will give $1 to pay for it. Do you agree with her?\\n\\nCOONS: Well, I agree with the advice that Lindsey Graham just gave to President Trump, which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on.\\n\\nI personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. What I think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the Trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. The humanitarian crisis I think may have been what she was referring to.\\n\\nThe larger point here, Chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between Democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. Far from it. All of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. And the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the Senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.\\n\\nI do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer.\\n\\nWALLACE: So, let's -- you're exactly right. I -- you have voted for a border barrier in the past and I've been looking at your records, so let's put it up on the screen. In 2013, as part of comprehensive immigration reform, you supported $46 billion for border security, including 350 miles of new fencing. In 2018, last year, you and most Senate Democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.\\n\\nSo here's the question: I understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of Democrats, including Pelosi, including Schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. So why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that Lindsey Graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on Dreamers and on TPS immigrants?\\n\\nCOONS: Chris, it would be great. If we could reach a resolution to our country's broken immigration system and find a path forward, we all agree to invest in border security, in new technologies and approaches that would actually make us safer.\\n\\nOne of the challenges of negotiating with President Trump, as Lindsey Graham knows better than anyone else, is I feel like I've signed up for the Trump of the day club. I don't know what position we're going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two. It was Senator Graham who famously talked about Tuesday Trump and Thursday Trump when he and Senator Durbin brought a comprehensive resolution, a bill, to President Trump last year, he embraced on Tuesday and then walked away and announced it on Thursday.\\n\\nI will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put a bill on the floor that was adopted unanimously by the Senate at the end of last year that would have kept the government open and supported 1.3 billion in border security. The president reversed position the next day and rejected something he told Mitch McConnell he would sign.\\n\\nWhy is Mitch McConnell completely absent from these negotiations? It's because he doesn't really know what the president will accept.\\n\\nWALLACE: But --\\n\\nCOONS: I don't expect the president to capitulate. I do expect them to compromise.\\n\\nWe are clearly not going to build a border wall funded by Mexico but we should negotiate.\\n\\nWALLACE: Forgive me -- but, Congressman (ph), the question is will Nancy Pelosi compromise? The Republican say, and you heard what Lindsey Graham just said, she's unwilling to give any money for the wall.\\n\\nI understand the issue with President Trump and he certainly has reversed course a few times. What I'm asking you now, and this is -- we are in week four of the shutdown, so the situation has become dire.\\n\\nCOONS: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: Are you, are the Democrats willing to make a compromise that includes money for a border wall fencing -- a border barrier I will call it -- in return for some concessions from the president on people in this country illegally?\\n\\nCOONS: I think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: I mean, because I want to move on --\\n\\nCOONS: So, compromise and while the government is shut down, I will remind you we got 41,000 federal law enforcement officers out there today being forced to work without pay. We've got farmers all over the country not getting the relief payments for the impact on the soybean industry due to tariff war.\\n\\nWALLACE: Sir, I understand all that, I'm just asking you if he agrees to a compromise that includes other things that the Democrats want, will the Democrats give way and include money for the border barrier? Yes or no?\\n\\nCOONS: Democrats will invest in border security. I'm not going to sit here on your show and negotiate on behalf of Speaker Pelosi, but I'll tell you that what Lindsey Graham himself just told the president is a great place to start here.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK.\\n\\nCOONS: Reopen the government, stop harming our country and our economy and let's make our best efforts because we all agree we need to invest more in border security.\\n\\nThe only crisis here is one that's been created by the president's abrupt change in position at the end of last year in the last days of a Republican-controlled Congress.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK, I want to move on just because I've got so many other questions to ask you.\\n\\nCOONS: Sure.\\n\\nWALLACE: What you think about the report in The New York Times that in 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was a Russian agent?\\n\\nCOONS: Well, that was a concerning, even alarming report and it suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion. I'm grateful for the partnership of Senator Graham, now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with Senators Tillis and Booker to protect the Mueller investigation, and I think that report by The New York Times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place.\\n\\nI will also say this, Chris -- I was very concerned by President Trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that Vladimir Putin's Russia had interfered in our 2016 election. There's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of President Trump to complement President Putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from Syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for President Putin.\\n\\nBut I do think what we can all agree on is that the Mueller investigation should reach its conclusion --\\n\\nWALLACE: All right.\\n\\nCOONS: -- should deliver a report publicly, and that will be the topic of the Barr nomination hearings this coming Tuesday.\\n\\nWALLACE: Let me -- I got these two more questions and I got two minutes. So, let's try and squeeze them in.\\n\\nYou're also a member --\\n\\nCOONS: Sure.\\n\\nWALLACE: -- of the judiciary committee which is going to hold the confirmation hearings --\\n\\nCOONS: Yes.\\n\\nWALLACE: -- on Bill Barr as the next attorney general. What does he need to say to persuade you, to assure you that he is going to let the Mueller investigation go to its conclusion and be reported to Congress? And is there anyway that that you can vote to confirm Bill Barr?\\n\\nCOONS: I'm keeping an open mind. We had a very constructive meeting this past week. I did ask him a number of questions right along those lines and will ask them again in the public confirmation hearing. I would need a firm commitment that he would not allow any interference in the Mueller investigation, he will allow it to reach its conclusion and he will release the report to the public.\\n\\nI also asked him about seeking an ethics opinion from the Department of Justice about whether he should recuse himself given some of the opinions he's expressed both in a memo that he sent unsolicited, challenging the obstruction of justice basis for some of Robert Mueller's investigation. He didn't make that commitment. He said it would depend on the facts at the time.\\n\\nI will re-ask that question this coming week. I have some other concerns about his views on criminal justice and civil rights. But the Mueller investigation, the rule of law, his willingness to defend the appropriate independence of the Department of Justice will be critical to my vote.\\n\\nWALLACE: And briefly, sir, I want to pick up on the conversation I was having with Senator Graham, given Justice Ginsburg's recent illness, the fact that she is going to be turning 86 in March, it's only understandable that there would be some discussion about the possibility of replacing her at some point.\\n\\nHave you given any thought given how -- and I know you were concerned about how ugly the Kavanaugh hearing is, how you avoid a repeat, particularly if it comes to the situation of Donald Trump replacing a woman who has become a liberal icon?\\n\\nCOONS: Well, frankly, I think the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end. What made the confirmation hearings of Justice Kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing.\\n\\nWALLACE: Right.\\n\\nCOONS: I have talked with Republican colleagues about finding a way that we have a clearer process for welcoming and vetting and making part of the confirmation process any such allegations so they don't arise at the last moment. I think there was a great deal of consternation over the timing of those allegations and then how seriously they were taken and investigated - - or not.\\n\\nWALLACE: Senator Coons, thank you. Thanks for joining us today. Please come back, sir.\\n\\nCOONS: Thank you, Chris. Thank you.\\n\\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss how and when the government shutdown will finally end.\\n\\nPlus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump's threat to declare a national emergency? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter, @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Coming up, the shutdown standoff drags on.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: Dealing with these people is ridiculous. I don't know if they know how to make a deal.\\n\\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., MINORITY LEADER: This is ridiculous and it's cruel and it needs to end now.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the president will declare a national emergency to fund his border wall, next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: I haven't done it yet. I may do it. If this doesn't work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.\\n\\nI have the absolute right to do it, but I'm not going to do it so fast because this is something Congress should do.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: President Trump changing course in a day on whether he is about to declare a national emergency and build a border wall on his own.\\n\\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group.\\n\\nGOP strategist Karl Rove, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center, and Josh Holmes, Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff.\\n\\nWell, Karl, let's start with the new wrinkle this week, can the president declare a national emergency to build the wall, should he declare a national emergency to build the wall?\\n\\nKARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, look, I'm not a lawyer and I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so I'm not the expert on this. But I have been paying careful attention to people who are. David French (ph) in The National Review had, I thought, a particularly penetrating article on this. He pointed out that the sections of the law in which the president would have to rely, say the president can declare an emergency that, quote, requires the use of armed force, he can do military construction projects that are necessary to support that use of armed force. That seems to me to not apply in this situation.\\n\\nThe other statute that would be used says that the president can declare an emergency that terminates projects, quote, not essential to national defense and apply those monies to, quote, construct or assist in the construction, maintenance or repair of -- of (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nWALLACE: I just asked you what time it is, I don't want to know how the watch is made. What -- what's the answer?\\n\\nROVE: Bottom line is, I think the authority to do so is -- is --\\n\\nWALLACE: Should he do it?\\n\\nROVE: Well, he may -- he -- maybe he should do it in order to get us out of the boxed canyon, because if he does do it, it will go to court and quickly, I think, the courts will say, you don't have the authority in this instance.\\n\\nI mean the administration in 2017 and 2018 has said, on the record, no terrorist organization has sent people to the United States through Mexico. So hard to declare it a national security emergency.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right.\\n\\nJANE HARMAN, DIRECTOR, WOODROW WILSON CENTER: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the president's thought about declaring a national emergency we got this tweet from Greg Engle. By declaring a national emergency, will this open the door for future -- future presidents to do the same over topics such as climate change, health care, or even gun control laws because of mass shootings? Is this really a national emergency or just fulfilling a campaign pledge?\\n\\nCongresswoman Harman, how do you answer Greg?\\n\\nHARMAN: It's not a national emergency. It is fulfilling a campaign pledge. The wall is a primal scream. In your conversation with -- your very good conversation just before with Lindsey Graham and Chris Coons, both of them made clear that there are ways that Congress can make a deal. That's the right answer. And I'm going to get in a fight with Josh because I think that Mitch McConnell, his old boss, who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called Playing the Long Ball, is bunting here and he could, if he chose to, rouse a veto proof majority in the Senate to pass what the Senate passed in the last Senate, which is the collection of CRs and then just leave one, that would be the Department of Homeland Security bill, with a shorter time frame to negotiate, have Lindsay and, as far as I'm concerned, Chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on TV, which maybe Trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it.\\n\\nWALLACE: I love the fact that this is a fight between President Trump and Nancy Pelosi. And poor Senator McConnell, you're probably sitting out there with your lovely wife, Elaine Chao, watching this and suddenly he gets dragged into this fight.\\n\\nHARMAN: Well, he is.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, wait, wait, let me -- let me -- as the shutdown drags into its fourth week, both sides are digging in harder than ever. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.\\n\\nPELOSI: It was a petulant president of the United States, a person who would say, I'll keep the government shutdown for week -- a month or years unless I get my way.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Josh, we have seen how government shutdowns play out. We've all been here for them. Usually they go on a week, maybe a week and a half, and at some point the public seems to turn against one side. That site generally blinks and they make a deal. One, why isn't it happening this time and, two, how long is this going to go on?\\n\\nJOSH HOLMES, FOUNDER, CAVALRY: Well, first let me respond to my good friend Jane's criticism. His book is named to The Long Game, which, unfortunately, is not the end of the untruths or misunderstands that we had about Mitch McConnell's role here.\\n\\nHARMAN: It's long, though.\\n\\nHOLMES: He basically played a role for eight years as minority leader in the Senate were Democrats control the Senate.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right, let's go -- let's move on. I don't want to talk about Mitch McConnell. I want to talk about the shutdown.\\n\\nHOLMES: Well, it's -- I think this is important to know because at that point he had an obligation to do a deal with an administration that didn't see eye to eye with his conference. That is precisely the role that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi find themselves in at this particular juncture. And instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government, Nancy Pelosi's telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up -- open up the government and fund the wall. That's ridiculous.\\n\\nThis is not a particularly difficult thing to bridge here. We're talking about a $4 billion discrepancy in a $4 trillion budget. This is not difficult. If this is -- if this is as difficult as it gets from here in this Congress, we're all going to be in good shape.\\n\\nWALLACE: So what are you saying, the deal should be some money for the wall, something between $1 billion and $5 billion in return for some concessions on people in this country illegally, like dreamers and the temporary protected status refugees?\\n\\nHOLMES: Yes, I think it's obvious, right? I mean if you're talking about a $4 billion discrepancy, there's got to be a way to get -- come to the middle of it. Certainly if you were in the Democratic Party right now, there are concessions that you're interested in accomplishing, right? And if that is the case, you ought to wonder down to the speaker's office and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office and give them a piece of your mind.\\n\\nWALLACE: So, Juan, why doesn't Speaker Pelosi, why don't the Democrats, make a deal?\\n\\nJUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's pretty clear right now, if you look at the polls this morning, that the president and Republicans are being blamed overwhelmingly for shutting down the government. And as Chris Coons pointed out to you this morning, Chris, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans had a unanimous support, Republicans and Democrats, for a bill that would have opened the government, kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward. It's the president who has made it a point to say, I'm shutting down this government over the wall.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK, but, wait a minute, but there are real people affected, right?\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Yes.\\n\\nWALLACE: Eight hundred thousand people who aren't getting paid. People who are depending on services, on going to the airport today. I don't know what is going to happen with TSA or --\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: The flight controllers or whatever.\\n\\nI understand all of that. And there's a lot of bad faith on both sides. Why not make a deal?\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think you have a situation here, just in pure political terms, where, one, it's only a shrinking Republican base that backs the president and you don't want to reward bullying, and that's what this comes down to. Secondly --\\n\\nWALLACE: So they're going to demand the president surrender?\\n\\nWILLIAMS: No, not surrender. See, I don't think it's a matter of capitulation or surrender. I think it's a matter of saying to the president, let's be honest about this. You had two years of Republican majorities, didn't get done. You had the Senate majority leader say let's negotiate. You refused. So it's bad behavior.\\n\\nAnd I might add here, remember that on the southern border eight congressional districts, including one Republican, none of them, including the Republican, voted for this wall, Chris. So the politics of this are very clear, its Trump, not the Republicans.\\n\\nROVE: That's simply not accurate. Look, last year --\\n\\nWALLACE: But let me just -- no, let me ask -- I don't want to go do history.\\n\\nHow does this get resolved?\\n\\nROVE: It gets resolved by adults showing up at this discussion. We have people on both sides who could find a way to get this done.\\n\\nJosh is right, we're talking about $4 billion. That is one-tenth of 1 percent of the federal budget. Out of every $100 spent by the federal government, we're talking about if you gave them $4 billion for the wall, it would be $0.10 out of every --\\n\\nWILLIAMS: This is in the weeds, Karl.\\n\\nROVE: Let me -- let me finish.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Karl, let me just say this to you.\\n\\nROVE: Let me finish. Let me finish.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Didn't he say Mexico was going to pay for this?\\n\\nROVE: Let me finish.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: Not the American taxpayer.\\n\\nROVE: OK, fine, we can stay stuck --\\n\\nHARMAN: Totally. Fully.\\n\\nROVE: WE can stay stuck in this and we can argue about Nancy Pelosi saying it's an immoral wall, which she voted for the wall last year and did not declare when -- when Barack Obama wrote -- built 133 miles of wall that that was immoral.\\n\\nHARMAN: Right.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: No, that was fencing. It was fencing and barriers, not wall.\\n\\nROVE: Oh, no, no, it was wall. It was wall.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: But it doesn't matter. This --\\n\\nROVE: Look, here's the bottom line --\\n\\nWILLIAMS: He said Mexico will pay for this this.\\n\\nROVE: OK, you can -- you can say stuck yesterday.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: OK.\\n\\nROVE: I think the American people are saying a pox on both your houses.\\n\\nHARMAN: Yes, well, and 800,000 of them are out of work because of it.\\n\\nROVE: Take a look -- let me finish. Let me finish. Let me finish. Let me finish.\\n\\nThe Economist -- The Economist poll said --\\n\\nWALLACE: Quickly.\\n\\nROVE: Asked the question in an interesting way, who do you blame a lot for this? Do you blame the Democrats in Congress a lot, 46 percent blame them a lot. Do you are blame the Republicans in Congress, 46 percent blame Republicans. And 59 percent --\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, and there's a new poll, an ABC/Washington Post poll that says 53 percent for the president and Republicans try -- anyway.\\n\\nROVE: Well, but it's only --\\n\\nWALLACE: May I just say one thing because we -- we -- we need to move onto the next segment. What I'm really happy about is that we were able to reach agreement at this table --\\n\\nROVE: Exactly.\\n\\nWALLACE: Which indicates that the shutdown's going to go on a long time.\\n\\nROVE: At least three of us can. At least three of us can.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break here.\\n\\nHARMAN: (INAUDIBLE).\\n\\nWALLACE: When we come back, we'll discuss that shocking report. The FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether President Trump was working for the Kremlin.\\n\\nPlus, is the White House already preparing its Supreme Court short list in case Justice Ginsburg steps down from the court? All that, next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: Was going to fire Comey. I -- there's no good time to do it, by the way. I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: President Trump in May of 2017 mentioning the Russia investigation as a reason he fired FBI Director James Comey. The New York Times now reports that was one of the reasons the FBI launched a counterintelligence probe into the president.\\n\\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\\n\\nWell, Karl, we have been in uncharted territory for much of the Trump presidency, but this has got to be the topper. The FBI -- the FBI launching a counterintelligence investigation into whether the president of the United States is a Russian agent.\\n\\nYour thoughts?\\n\\nROVE: Yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of Comey. This was leaked to The New York Times, which says something about the culture inside the FBI. The only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since Comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, Mueller is appointed. This was probably immediately subsumed by Mueller -- the Mueller investigation and has been, I suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.\\n\\nBut it says something that the FBI would react to the firing of Comey this way and that somebody -- somebody who was then near the top of the FBI, leaked this to The New York Times. Shame on them.\\n\\nWALLACE: President Trump, not surprisingly, went on a Twitter storm about this story yesterday.\\n\\nHere's just one of his tweets. Wow, just learned in a failing New York Times that the corrupt leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me for no reason and with no proof after I fired lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze.\\n\\nOne sentence, incidentally. Pretty impressive.\\n\\nJuan, you have to assume, if they had found evidence in the last year and a half that the president was a Russian agent, they would have intervened.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: No, I think it was, as Karl said, all went to the Mueller pro. And --\\n\\nWALLACE: But if they found that the president --\\n\\nWILLIAMS: They're an investigative agency, right?\\n\\nWALLACE: I understand, but if the White House -- if the FBI found evidence that the president was an ongoing Manchurian candidate, an agent for the Russians, you don't think that that -- they -- they'd just sit on that and --\\n\\nHARMAN: No.\\n\\nWILLIAMS: I think it's up to Mueller. It's up to Mueller to say this is, one, provable and part of my ultimate report. You do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation. And this is unprecedented. The FBI, as you said, going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn, a Manchurian candidate, for the Russians. But what we can say, and I -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have Mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. Michael Cohen is not going to testify before Congress. I think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. And right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. There something going on.\\n\\nBut I don't think it's the case that, oh, therefore if they had found something right away it would have led to immediate charges against this president.\\n\\nWALLACE: Josh?\\n\\nHOLMES: Well, I think if you cut away from the sort of conspiracy and all the invective that this New York Times article actually injects into our public discourse, what we've learned here is the mind-set of the FBI at the time. We learned nothing about the fact pattern that the president of the United States engaged in. In fact, we've known all of this for months.\\n\\nWhat we now know is that the -- the FBI formalized what McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page and all others have been doing for a matter of months before that point of view. They believed in their core of core that the president of the United States was a foreign agent and they were going to conduct investigations come hell or high water. This provided a perfect excuse for them to do so.\\n\\nWALLACE: I want to go quickly to this and then move on.\\n\\nHARMAN: OK. No. And I think that what you said, Chris, is right. This is a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. And if they have had real evidence that the president was a Manchurian candidate, I think they would have intervene right then. I mean we can't have that go on -- an unprecedented whatever I -- collusion, cooperation, arrangement with one of our most important, strategic competitors, Russia.\\n\\nSo we'll learn soon from Mueller what's going on here.\\n\\nI do want to agree with Karl -- agree with Karl and deplore the leak of information like this.\\n\\nROVE: And I -- and I agree with your finding about this.\\n\\nThis is sort of like this --\\n\\nWALLACE: OK, no, no, this, no, we need shouting. OK, I want to move on.\\n\\nThere --\\n\\nROVE: This came out of a GI Joe movie. Yes.\\n\\nWALLACE: There were new questions this week about Justice Ginsburg after it turned out that she has missed arguments, a lot of us didn't know this, for the first time in her quarter century on the court.\\n\\nHere's what she said in 2017 about how long she will continue as a justice.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG, SUPREME COURT: As long as I can do the job full -- full steam, I will do it.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Josh, you know, a lot of us deplored, whatever side you were on, the Kavanaugh hearing and how ugly that was and how the Senate seemed to break down over it.\\n\\nI got to say, if you have Donald Trump replacing the notorious RBG, that's a perfect political storm, isn't it?\\n\\nHOLMES: Yes. I mean let me say at the outset, I think everybody hopes that Justice Ginsburg recovers fully.\\n\\nWALLACE: Of course.\\n\\nHOLMES: But -- but you're right --\\n\\nWALLACE: And there's every sign that she is.\\n\\nHOLMES: Yes. I think, given what we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings and everything else, you can -- you can say what you will, but this will be the first time that there is a seat that actually changes from a liberal held seat to a conservative held seat. And -- and if you think the Kavanaugh hearings was divisive, wait until you get a load of this. I mean this will be the -- the granddaddy of them all in terms of Supreme Court battles.\\n\\nI think -- I was encouraged by what I heard from Chris Coons earlier in your interview, that he was working alongside Republicans to try to find a process -- which, of course, I believe is the biggest problem with the Kavanaugh hearings, the process that was held closed until the last minute and try to jump into a -- make the whole thing a political dynamic, which, of course, ruined --\\n\\nWALLACE: What you're saying is the fact that suddenly Christine Blasey Ford and all of that stuff came out at the last -- at the 11th hour.\\n\\nHOLMES: It was designed to create a political circus and sabotage two people's lives in the process. That is absolutely the wrong way to go and I'm encouraged that it -- what we're hearing from a Senate Judiciary Committee that we're going to try to reform some of that.\\n\\nWALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, this is a delicate subject. I understand it as I ask the question. Was it foolish for Ruth Bader Ginsburg not to step down in the middle of President Obama's term?\\n\\nHARMAN: No, it wasn't foolish. I -- she may look frail, but she's -- she's an iron maiden. She is a -- I knew her first when she was a litigator in the '70s and she's always been a petite woman whose voice sometimes wobbles, but her mind is strong and it's her call. And she wears that diva t-shirt in the gym at the -- at the Supreme Court and she's a trailblazer for women. I mean -- and she'll know when it's time. She's not going to hang on if she can't function fully in the job.\\n\\nAnd the only thing she's missing right now are oral arguments. She's participating by phone in the decision about what cases to take. And hopefully she will fully recover soon. Her doctors say she's on course and she's cancer free.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right.\\n\\nAll right, we have time -- I want to get into one last subject.\\n\\nSecretary of State Pompeo is on a tour of the Middle East this week. In Cairo, he went after Barack Obama's Mideast policy. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Karl, he was talking there specifically about the president and -- and firing back at the policies of the president you worked for, Bush 43. But where are we on Syria right now? Because the president said we're going to get out right away. Then John Bolton, the national security advisor, said, well, it depends on what happens with the Kurds and ISIS. Now we hear the Pentagon is pulling equipment out. Do you know where we are?\\n\\nROVE: No. And we have a disconnect between I -- what I thought was an excellent speech by Pompeo. He opens up by saying, America is a force for good in the Middle East. Repudiates the Obama era doctrines. But there is a disconnect between that and pulling us out of Syria.\\n\\nMy hope is, is that our withdraw from Syria, I assume that the president's going to fulfill it, is done in an orderly fashion. But let's recognize our withdrawal empowers Russia, it empowers Iran, it empowers the Syrians. And the ultimate result of it may be Iranian-supported militias on the northern border of Israel, which is anathema to our interests and our allies.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, it -- we've got less than a minute left.\\n\\nCongresswoman, I mean this was such a sore point when the president said we're going to pull out that James Mattis, the defense secretary, quit over it. Now they seem to be reshuffling it. Do you understand what the policy is?\\n\\nHARMAN: No, and I don't think there's one person in the Trump administration who agrees with the policy. Understand that Bret McGurk, who was the special advisor dealing with the ISIS coalition --\\n\\nWALLACE: The coalition.\\n\\nHARMAN: Also retired early in protest. So that's two.\\n\\nBut I've been looking around, and -- and Karl is exactly right on who it exposes, but in addition to that, there could be a Turk massacre of the Kurds who fought side-by-side with us, not only in Syria but in Iraq and Israel is totally vulnerable because of this on its northern border.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Well, one more subject to be continued.\\n\\nThank you, all, panel. See you next Sunday.\\n\\nUp next, we'll be back with a final word.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on the continuing government shutdown.\\n\\nAnd that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next Fox News Sunday.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

{"original": "This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, January 10, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Watch the whole thing. Laura Ingraham interviewing the President starts right now. See you, Monday.\\n\\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is the Ingraham Angle tonight from Washington. And do we have a show for you tonight? My exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House. It's been a wild week all around in Washington. Of course, the rest of the world. The President passed a monumental leadership test this week with flying colors. First, we had an Iranian missile attack in retaliation for the killing of terrorist mastermind Soleimani. Democrats of course predicted World War III would ensue. And as usual, the President proved them wrong. So, now hostilities aren't a deescalated state and Iran may and I underline may even come to the negotiating table. No one thought that was going to happen. Second, the President and the GOP held firm on impeachment. And boy, did that strategy pay off. After weeks of delay, Nancy Pelosi is finally caving, and she will transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Her plot to control the Senate trial has been completely foiled. Oops. Well, I had the great privilege of sitting down with the President for a wide-ranging interview today. He made news on all of these important topics and a lot more and he shared his plans for the New Year. Here's part one of my exclusive interview with President Trump.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, thanks so much for being with us tonight.\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Laura.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Today, Mike Pompeo gave a very forceful press conference on the fallout from the Iranian jetliner going down. His concern is that people aren't understanding the imminent nature of the threat of Soleimani, and he was pressed on that today. He said, there were large scale attacks planned on U.S. facilities, but he didn't go more specific. Don't the American people have a right to know what specifically was targeted without revealing methods and sources?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, I don't think so, but we will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad. You saw that happening. You saw with all of the men, very few women circling it and circling it very strongly and very viciously, knocking out windows and trying to get in and they were close to getting in and I called out the military. They said, we'll have it there tomorrow. I said, no, you'll have it there today. We're not going to have another Benghazi on our hands. And we did a really amazing job, get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything and that's OK. In the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things. But I think you would have had another Benghazi had we not acted quickly. That could have been stopped. And this was stopped. And we had our Apaches going there, the great helicopters and they were dropping flares all over the place and a lot of things were happening. They had action real fast and everybody disappeared.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: City of large-scale attacks planned for other embassies and if those were planned, why can't we reveal that to the American people? Wouldn't that help your case?\\n\\nTRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been for embassies. And I think that probably Baghdad already started. They were really amazed that we came in with that kind of a force. We came in with very powerful force and drove them out. You know that ended almost immediately. But Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been for embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too. But it was imminent and then all of a sudden, he was gone.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Why is Nancy Pelosi describing her briefing as dismissive and disdainful? Mike Lee said it was insulting the Intel briefing. What wasn't said to mollify the concerns of some of your strongest supporters like Mike Lee?\\n\\nTRUMP: Yes, he is a great supporter. He is a friend of mine. He called me just a little while ago and he said, you know, I just wanted to get some more information and he was - look, I have also had calls from some of the senators, some of the congressmen said it was the single best briefing. One person said they've been there for 10 years. It's the single best briefing they've ever had. One said 20 years, the single best military briefing they've ever had. I understand what Mike had, Mike wanted certain things said and we just couldn't say, and we could probably say maybe individually to him and he's certainly a trustworthy person.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Are you worried that the Democrats can't be trusted with classified information because that's kind of what it sounded like when Pence gave that interview and talked about sources and methods the other day.\\n\\nTRUMP: I am worried about it. Certainly, I am worried about it. Can you imagine, here we are split second timing executed like nobody has seen in many, many years on Soleimani. Can you imagine, they want us to call up and speak to crooked corrupt politician, Adam Schiff. Oh! Adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time. We have a shot at him right now. Could we meet so that we can get your approval Adam Schiff. And he'd say well, let's do it in a couple of days. Oh! OK. Let's meet in a couple - it doesn't work that way. Number one. Number two, they leak. Anything we give will be leaked immediately. You'll see breaking news. We're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something. And by the way, I'm not somebody that wants to attack. I probably could have attacked five times, 10 times having to do with Iran. I've been very guarded because I don't want to do that. But we may have to do something. We have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint. But hopefully it won't be necessary. We have tremendous sanctions. They're doing very poorly. They have riots all over their country and they could straighten out easy. But it's up to them. Whatever they want to be.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Speaking of sanctions, Ilhan Omar, I think said today that this is akin to economic warfare against Iran, even though she supports sanctions against Israel.\\n\\nTRUMP: Yes. She hates Israel. She hates Jewish people. You just have to take a look at her rhetoric. It's incredible what's happened to the Democrats in Congress. They used to be supportive of Israel. Today, they're supportive of her and Tlaib. That's another real winner. Tlaib and AOC who knows nothing. AOC knows nothing. Poor student, poor everything and then she comes, and she talks about the Green New Deal and all these poor fools say, isn't it wonderful, isn't it wonderful. But you know as I said last night in Ohio, I don't like talking about the Green New Deal, it's too early. I want to save it for about two weeks before because they may change their mind.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders was out. You're not surprised to hear this, discussing Iran. What happened. And he basically said this.\\n\\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just as we were led into Vietnam and Iraq by lies, the Trump administration is misleading us on Iran. They just did the assassination of Qasem Soleimani by claiming that he was planning imminent attacks and yet they produce no evidence that would justify this claim, not even in a classified setting.\\n\\nTRUMP: I don't see it happening. We are there for a very, very strong reason. They cannot have nuclear weapons. The Iran nuclear deal signed by President Obama gave 150 billion and that's when the real terrorist started. They took that money and they used it all over the place. You look at Yemen, you look at all of the things that were happening including Syria. They were using, Pallister (ph) gave 1.8 billion in cash, 1.7, 1.8 billion in cash. Green cash, beautiful green cash. You almost - how do they have the power to do this plane load of cash and instead of Iran saying, thank you very much. It's really nice. Let's go and get along. Let's do well. Let's do deals together. Let's build buildings in Iran. They said, Death to America and they said it when they were signing. When Kerry signed, and by the way, Kerry violated the Logan Act.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: He's out there. He's out there just slamming you.\\n\\nTRUMP: He totally violated. This man totally violated the Logan Act with his conversations. OK. But when Kerry was out there and making the deal and they had people screaming, Death to America, Death to America, who signs a deal while they're screaming Death to America.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They're saying you destabilized the Middle East after campaigning as a man of restraint, not interventionism. Elizabeth Warren is saying this, Kerry saying this, all the old Obama folks are out there, Susan Rice, they're all kind of waiting in the wings, like see he's the guy that we told you he was.\\n\\nTRUMP: If you look at the Middle East right now, it's much tamer than it was when I got in. When I got in, it was just all over the place. Number one, we got rid of the caliphate, the ISIS caliphate. We have tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners. We've killed most of their fighters. We've gotten rid of ISIS. Now they come back and we take care of it. Other people should take care of it. Other countries should take care of it. Europe should take them back.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Is NATO going to actually step up? I know they're committed to doing more in the Middle East. But what specifically is NATO going to contribute that's going to take some of the burden off the American taxpayers.\\n\\nTRUMP: So, when I came in as you know NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. If you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a rollercoaster down. Now, and Secretary Stoltenberg, I think he's terrific. In my first year, I raised $130 billion from them, not from us. And now he just announced $530 billion, all because of me. He's my biggest salesman. My greatest salesman Secretary Stoltenberg. But I said to him, look, you're there for Russia and Europe. OK. By the way, NATO is much more for Europe than it is for us and yet we--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: What are we protecting them from now, all the money we're spending in NATO. Who are we protecting them from?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, they build an office building for $3 billion. They do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing before I got here. But I raised a lot of money. We can use NATO in other locations. We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East. And that's what we should do. I think frankly it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East, if an international force comes in rather than just the United States. And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved our troops out of Syria - on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect it. They've been fighting over that border for a thousand years. Why should we do it? And then they say, he left troops in Syria. You know what I did, I left troops to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have are taking the oil. They're protecting the oil. I took over the oil.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: We're taking, we're not taking--\\n\\nTRUMP: Maybe we will, maybe we won't.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They're protecting their facility.\\n\\nTRUMP: I don't know maybe we should take it. But we have the oil. Right now, the United States has the oil. So, they say, he left troops in Syria. No, I got rid of all of them other than we're protecting the oil. We have the oil.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: The Wall Street Journal is reporting today that after this strike, Mr. Trump told associates he was under pressure to deal with General Soleimani, take him out. From GOP senators, he views as important supporters in the coming impeachment trial in the Senate. Associates said sounds like you've got a leaker here in the White House or someone. What is it, it's just fake?\\n\\nTRUMP: They just made it up. It's fake news.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: OK. Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nTRUMP: They use the term, leakers. They just make it up. They're all very dishonest. Most of them are really - I mean 80 percent are dishonest and I mean really dishonest. They made that story up.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: So, no concern about Lindsey Graham or--\\n\\nTRUMP: No, not at all. By the way, absolutely not at all. We have tremendous support. Look in the House we own 196 to nothing and we got three Democrats. So therefore, it was bipartisan, I guess you could say. We got nothing. They had nothing. We didn't lose one Republican vote. As you know, that's very unusual. In the Senate I think I have the same if not more support, I don't have to do that. I would never compromise what we're doing with Iran and potential war and all of the things that we're doing so well--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: So, we're not doing Bush 2.0 here? This is not Bush 2.0. This is not WMD.\\n\\nTRUMP: You know what I want in the Middle East, I don't want people having nuclear weapons because they'll use them. I don't want people having nuclear weapons. That's my biggest thing.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, John Kerry was out there yesterday saying, well, you guys got out of the Iran deal and that's what's caused all this tension.\\n\\nTRUMP: By the way, you know how bad the Iran deal was? The Iran deal, I did a great thing getting out of the Iran deal. They gave 150 billion, they gave 1.8 and forget that. You couldn't do inspections of the most important locations. And you know another big thing, they have the right to do ballistic missiles. We couldn't go into areas and look; we'd have to give massive notice. So, if they were doing something that they could clean them up, it was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now once it expired, they have an absolute clear, unstopped path of nuclear weapons. Unstopped. In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen that deal expires and you know what? Once it expires, you can't do what I did. I mean because they have a deal that says once it expires, they can do what they want to do. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. That's what I'm doing.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Pete Buttigieg and other Democrats, I predicted this when I talked to Mike Pompeo yesterday are actually blaming your moves against Iran for the downing of that commercial jetliner in Iran, in Tehran, the night of the strikes by Iran to our Iraqi facilities. Your reaction to that charge?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, a couple of people started that, and they got hit real fast by a lot of different people, not me. I think it's just low life. Look, he's not going anywhere. He was a lousy mayor of a place that is not doing well, and Indiana is doing unbelievably. Indiana, the state had the best year they've ever had. Thank you very much. But that city was badly run. You look at what's going on.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Jackie Speier saying on this too.\\n\\nTRUMP: He's going nowhere. And she's another beauty. I mean take a look at her past. Check out her past please.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: The Iraqi Prime Minister has notified Mike Pompeo about potential plans, drawing up plans for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. You ran on pulling out of the Middle East, why not use this opportunity to say, we're done.\\n\\nTRUMP: I'm OK with it. By the way--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You're OK with removing our troops from Iraq?\\n\\nTRUMP: That's what they say publicly. They don't say that privately because if we leave that means they're not going to be--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Why not leave?\\n\\nTRUMP: I'm not so bad with it. When I heard that I said I have it down to 5000 troops. We had many, many troops there in Iraq and we're there only in a training. We trained them. But if they'd want us to leave, but they speak different publicly than they do privately.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But are we sending more troops to the region as we speak?\\n\\nTRUMP: We're sending more to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is paying us for it. We're doing something that nobody has ever done. I said to Saudi Arabia, we have a very good relationship with Saudi Arabia, I said listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops. I'm going to send them to you. But you've got to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank. We are going to help them, but these rich countries have to pay for it. South Korea gave us $500 million. They never gave us - they gave us $500 million. I said you're going to help us along. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea protecting you from North Korea. You've got to pay. And they gave us $500 million. I mean you should have breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff. I'm not sure anybody knows it. I might be sort of saying it, you have some - I mean its good stuff. But they are a wealthy country. They build all your television sets. They took that away from us. They build the ships. They build a lot of things. I said look, we're protecting you. You've got to pay. They paid us $500 million. They're going to pay us a lot more.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Do you think that Iraq should repay the American taxpayer for these bases?\\n\\nTRUMP: Sure.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: For what we've done there.\\n\\nTRUMP: You heard that from me. OK.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes. Why don't we (ph).\\n\\nTRUMP: I said we built one of the world's most expensive airport facilities anywhere in the world. I mean I wish we had it in New York. I wish we had it in Washington. We build runways that are 15,000 feet long at LaGuardia, they're 7000 feet long. In fact, I think they're 20,000 feet long over there and deep thick concrete and steel. Nobody ever built runways like this. OK, it's way overbuilt, but that's OK. But we have billions of dollars into that. I said if we leave, you've got to pay us. If we leave, you have to pay us for embassies, you have to pay us for the money we put in.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: How you're going to collect.\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, we have a lot of their money right now. We have a lot of their money. We have $35 billion of their money right now sitting in an account. And I think they'll agree to pay. I think they'll agree to pay. Otherwise, we'll stay there.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Up ahead, my exclusive interview with President Trump continues. His thoughts on Nancy Pelosi's failed political gambit. The big news that the speaker is sending the articles to the Senate. And later, Raymond Arroyo reacts to the President's thoughts on the rogue royals and a lot more. Breaking news all ahead. Stay there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, we just learned that Nancy Pelosi is now, she's sending articles of impeachment next week to the Senate. What's your reaction?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, I think it's ridiculous. She should have sent them a long time ago. It just - it belittles the process. What they've done to impeachment. It's like I was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter somebody that you know very well. I can say Bob Woodward. He said, he's doing something and this time, I said maybe I'll sit down, because nobody has done more than me. I mean nobody - if you look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything, and all the things, we've rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. Our military was old and depleted. And he said you know you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment, as you know he's slightly covered Nixon and he covered Clinton. But Bob Woodward, he said, you actually look like you've won everything, you look happy. I said, I am happy. So maybe I'm wired a little bit different.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Impeachment managers anyone that you would prefer to see, she has a name--\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, we have a team.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Her impeachment managers. They have a name--\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, I would love to ask a couple of their people some questions like Schiff, why did he lie? Why did he make up my statement? Totally made it up. But again, the whole thing unraveled when I put in the transcript because it's all about the transcript and it's all about the President of Ukraine saying, he did nothing.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: How long do you think this will last?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, it depends. If they have a trial, probably takes a few days or a week and unless we want to have a bigger trial, where we bring in the whistleblower which I'd love to do, and I'd love to bring in the informer who disappeared. I'd love to bring in the second whistleblower who disappeared. I'd love to bring in the Inspector General. Why did he bring it up there? He should have never done it. He didn't want to see the call. He didn't want to see the call. He took this whistleblower, who's a fraud. He took the whistleblowers' report and he put it in. They said to him, no, if that's the case, if you have to do that, what we'll do is we'll show you the actual call. No, no, I don't want to see it. What's that all about? Why did he do that? Inspector General, so I'd like to interview the Inspector General. Why did he do that and put everybody through--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You're worried about future presidents, what this is going to do to the presidency in the future?\\n\\nTRUMP: I think it cheapened the word impeachment. I think impeachment is a very ugly word, but I think this cheapen the word impeachment. I think Nancy Pelosi and Schiff, because he's corrupt. I mean he's the guy stands up at the United States Congress and repeats a conversation except it was a fraud. He made up a conversation. He was saying my conversation and it was totally wrong and he knew it. He said, don't call me, I'll call you. That's from the Godfather. That's a mafia statement. I never said that. He said eight times quid pro quo. It was no times. He made up a conversation and repeated it in front of Congress and because he has immunity, we can't do anything about it. I'd like to say, why did you do that? Now, these people are frauds and it's very bad. No, they've cheapened the word impeachment. It's a bad word to start off with. I really say, it's an ugly word. To me, it's a very ugly word, but maybe it played to our benefit.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: When we talk about impeachment now, it looks like McConnell is agreeing with Josh Holly's (ph)--\\n\\nTRUMP: Good.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Proposition to dismiss these articles of impeachment, if Pelosi doesn't send them over. My question to you is, why not have it dismissed today? Why would McConnell just say, we're done with these games or do you want a trial, you want one?\\n\\nTRUMP: In many ways, I'd like a trial. And I'd love to have Sleepy Joe Biden. I'd love to have his son. I call him Where's Hunter, I've changed his first name to Where, Where's Hunter. I'd love to have the whistleblower who wrote a fake report. The whistleblower is a person that is you know who the whistleblower is. By the way, everybody knows who the whistleblower is.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Whistleblower is still working in the White House?\\n\\nTRUMP: Everybody - I don't want to say. But everybody knows about the whistleblower and they know about the whistleblower's lawyer. But then, do you remember, there was a second whistleblower. I want to know what happened to the second whistleblower. What happened to the informer? Remember that an informer. They all disappeared when I gave the transcript because I gave a transcript and that blew everything apart, because we have an accurate. And if the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree. Everybody. Even our great Lieutenant Colonel, please call him Lieutenant Colonel or great Lieutenant Colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different. We'll change the one word, it meant absolutely nothing. The transcript was professionally done by the best people there. Just one second. So, we have a transcript. They never thought I'd release it. They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call. Think of this. I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Always.\\n\\nTRUMP: The President of Ukraine said, I did absolutely nothing wrong. He said, I had no pressure whatsoever. He didn't even know what we were talking about. And we called them before I released the transcript, because it's a terrible thing to have to release a conversation with a leader from another country, it's a terrible thing. I mean what are other countries other than Ukraine, what are they saying. So, anyway, they have no case.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Why not call Bolton, why not allow him to testify. This thing is bogus.\\n\\nTRUMP: I would have no problem other than one thing. You can't be in the White House as President's future. I'm talking about future, many future presidents and have a security adviser. Anybody having to do with security and legal and other things.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You're going to invoke Executive Privilege?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office. I would love everybody to testify. I like Mick to testify. I like Mike Pompeo to testify. I like Rick Perry to testify. I want everybody, but there are things you can't do from the standpoint of Executive Privilege. You have to maintain that. So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic. But she will go down as I think maybe the worst Speaker in the history of our country.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: How do you get--\\n\\nTRUMP: And she'll be overthrown pretty soon, because she's doing very little. And the people are tired of it. And she's controlled by the radical Left. She's controlled by AOC. She's controlled by this Tlaib, it's another great one and she's controlled by Omar.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: We just heard that, they are thinking about adding another article on impeachment. They're floating this to include the events of the last few weeks. Here's what Chuck Schumer just said.\\n\\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Over the past few weeks, there have been several crucial disclosures of evidence that appear to further incriminate the President. Each disclosure bolstering the argument we Democrats have made for a trial that features the relevant witnesses and documents.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Your reaction to their potentially adding to articles of impeachment. They still haven't delivered to the Senate floor.\\n\\nTRUMP: So, they can't win an election that's going to take place in 10 months. They know that and the only thing they can do, it's like quit there (ph). Congressman Green, when he said we can't beat him, we have to impeach him. And they all know that. They're making things up. This is the craziest thing anyone has ever seen. And the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes. They're not even allowed to be put in. It's a disgrace.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Does it not show the weakness of their case, but they're still trying to rebrand this as something else?\\n\\nTRUMP: I think it's incredible.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I've never seen anything like this. This is--\\n\\nTRUMP: I think it's incredible. I think it's really hurting them. Look, my numbers are the highest, my poll numbers. You have this guy that goes on television all the time. He gives phony numbers. My poll, as you know, my poll numbers right now today are the highest they've ever been. And, by the way, people love that we took this horrible terrorist. They love it, Soleimani. The love that we took him out. They think it's so fantastic. He should have been taken out over the last 20 years by somebody. He should have been taken out a long time ago. But my numbers are the highest they've ever been, and a lot of it is because of the impeachment hoax. It's a hoax. How would you like to be two, two-and-a-half years, I'm under investigation, federal investigation before I even ran, in my opinion, before I came down the escalator. But from the time I came down the escalator, I have been under investigation. They found nothing. They found nothing. Who else do you think in Washington --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Few could have withstood it.\\n\\nTRUMP: No, no. Think of it, not only withstood it mentally. And I think --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But accomplished.\\n\\nTRUMP: -- it actually energizes you, yes, because it makes me angry. But think, who else could have withstood that? You take some of these Democrat senators, they couldn't withstand it. You know what would happen? Number, one, they would fold up like an umbrella. And number two, they'd be guilty of a lot of stuff.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: More of my exclusive interview with President Trump in just moments. His thoughts on immigration, bringing in all those foreign workers, the economy, and whether he really trusts Google in the election year. Plus, a little later on, his thoughts on the latest royal scandal. Stay there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nAISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Aishah Hasnie. Bernie Sanders leading in Iowa with the first nominating contest just weeks away. Twenty percent of likely Democratic caucus goers support the Vermont senators, that's according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second place with 17 percent, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is third with 16 percent, and former V.P. Joe Biden has 15 percent. The Iowa caucuses are on February 3rd. Meantime, Texas is cracking down on new refugees. Governor Greg Abbott says his state is already overwhelmed and is now rejecting resettlements. It is the first state in the nation to do so under a Trump administration order granting local governments that authority. Abbott's decision is being denounced by refugee advocates and others. I'm Aishah Hasnie. Now back to The Ingraham Angle.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You slapped the sanctions back on China, the tariffs, the extra tariffs, if they don't fulfill what they said they would do --\\n\\nTRUMP: Yes, well, I have the right to do that. But people don't realize, I still have the tariffs, 25 percent tariffs on China on $250 billion worth of goods. I still have those. And by the way, remember, they used to say we pay for it. No, no. China devalued their currency and they pay for it. And we have a great relationship with China right now. So I don't want to speak badly of anyone, but they are having the worst year that they've had. The last year was the worst year they've had in 67, it was 57, now it's 67 years. And they wanted to make a deal, and we made a deal. And it's a great deal. Now we have a phase two deal which will start at some point, but phase one was very important for banking. You know what we did, we opened it up to banking, but for banking, for our farmers, for manufacturers, it's a great, it's a great --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: If China, though, is --\\n\\nTRUMP: We have a lot of these deals that I've made, South Korea, Japan. Japan --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Undocumented all of this. No one else has touched it.\\n\\nTRUMP: Remember this, they are all kicking in now. We didn't have anything. We had horrible deals or no deal. The Japan deal, we had no deal. We are getting $40 billion. What this is going to do for our economy is going to be amazing. And it was just signed a month ago, it's just now kicking in.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: On the human rights issue in China, you don't talk a lot about it, but it concerns a lot of your strongest supporters, evangelical Christians, Catholics, other people who are really concerned about human rights. You've got 1 million people in reeducation camps, internment camps, Catholics getting missiles in their pews at Christmas that had tributes to Xi instead of Silent Night, crazy stuff happening. Reagan saw the power of the moral argument for freedom and married it to the economic and military argument for peace through strength. Can you do more on that front without damaging your ability to make future trade agreements, more on the human rights front?\\n\\nTRUMP: Well, we're riding a fine line, because we are making not good trade deals. We're making great trade deals.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But human rights count.\\n\\nTRUMP: They do count. And when you say Reagan, look, I was a big fan of Reagan, but he wasn't heavy into it. He wanted to do certain things, he wasn't really heavy into it. But he wasn't also making trade deals. He let Japan come in and take our automobile market. As much as I like Reagan, he was not good on trade.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: He didn't trade with the Soviet Union at all. We didn't have a big bunch of students from the Soviet Union coming into the United States.\\n\\nTRUMP: I think we should be able to trade with Russia. I think we should be able -- I think getting along -- by the way, getting along with Russia, now that the witch hunt has ended having to do with Russia, now that they spend $45 million, found nothing.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President when you look at the trajectory of your administration, huge progress on trade, incredible progress on dealing with our political foes, ISIS, incredible deregulation, judges, you've done a lot. On the economy today, we found out that still added 146,000 jobs, unemployment historically low at 3.5 percent. But we do have a little bit of a stall out on wage growth, which you ran on, and we've seen some, 2.9 percent last year, 0.1 percent over the last month.\\n\\nTRUMP: I know.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But we don't have a tight labor market. If we had a tight labor market, we'd be seeing real increases in wages. I hear that your team is planning on advocating more foreign workers coming in for some of these high-tech companies. I'm very concerned about that, as are a lot of your supporters.\\n\\nTRUMP: And so is Mark Levin a little bit.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, we are concerned, because Americans --\\n\\nTRUMP: So is the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is concerned, too. But I'll say, Lou, here is the problem. I am demanding that Japan and all these countries that have these massive, we have trade deficits like nobody has ever seen before. I said you have to open up. I call Prime Minister Abe, he's a friend of mine. I say Shinzo, you have got to open up more plants in the United States. And they tell me, we want to do it, we want to do it. They start opening. They can't get labor. We need help. Otherwise, we could just say don't open up --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: If they couldn't get labor, wages would be going up. But wages aren't going up.\\n\\nTRUMP: Wage are going up.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Not in the high-tech industry. We are seeing a plateauing of wages.\\n\\nTRUMP: It went up three percent and it went up 2.9 percent. In the last two year, wages have gone up more than they have 25 years.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But for Google, why reward Google? Google is working against you in the campaign.\\n\\nTRUMP: I don't want to reward Google. I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of Google.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All they want is low skilled workers, low paid workers.\\n\\nTRUMP: I'm not a fan of Google. I'm a fan of great companies, OK.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You did not run on bringing more foreign workers into the United States.\\n\\nTRUMP: It's not foreign workers. We have to allow smart people to stay in our country. Your graduate number one in your class at Harvard. You graduate from the Wharton Schools of --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: That's a small percentage of what they want.\\n\\nTRUMP: No, it's not. It's a lot.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But you ran on people training their foreign replacements -- you ran against that. The Americans, it's humiliating for an American worked for a company for 30 years, now is told you have to train your foreign replacement, he's going to live in Korea, and you're going to pay him 20 percent.\\n\\nTRUMP: No, no, that's different. I would never do that. But we do need workers in our country. And I do want immigration policy. Nobody's been better on immigration then me. By the way we won the funding for the wall, and the wall has been built anyway because I was taking it out of the military and everything else. And now it's easier. We need people come. I got Foxconn to go into Wisconsin. They have to get people. They spent a fortune, they built the most incredible plant I've ever seen in Wisconsin, Foxconn --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They why should we have American graduates of colleges and universities taking those jobs?\\n\\nTRUMP: We do. No, we do, we do, but we don't have enough of them. We don't have enough of them. And we have to be competitive with the rest of the world, too. The companies want to hire these people.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They want to hear people they can hire for the cheapest amount because that's what they want.\\n\\nTRUMP: I'm not talking about cheap. I'm talking about brainpower. They want to hire smart people. And those people are thrown out of the country. We can't do that.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You ran on America first.\\n\\nTRUMP: No, this is America first.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All right, I'm going to keep going.\\n\\nTRUMP: Excuse, I just have to finish this. If we tell smart people to get the hell out --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: That's not what we are saying.\\n\\nTRUMP: That's a bad thing.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: There is a never-ending appetite on the part of corporate America to bring in as much cheap labor as possible to drive down wages. That's going to happen.\\n\\nTRUMP: Laura, I have so many people coming into this country, you're not going to have to worry about it. It's always going to be a shortage. If somebody smart sitting in this position, we have so many companies coming in from Japan. Japan is doing many car companies. China now is going to start building a lot of things. They haven't been doing it too much. We have so many companies wanting to come in, and they don't have the labor. But they're coming in.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All right.\\n\\nTRUMP: We're doing great. Our country is doing great, our economy is doing great.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Coming up, the president on the Queen's Harry situation, and the news that the Olympics proposing to ban athletes' protests, politics particularly. Does he think that should happen here? Then our own Raymond Arroyo, will join me with reaction. Stay there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, I know you were close to the Queen, and she has a lot of affection for you. You have great visits over there.\\n\\nTRUMP: We have a great relationship.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Would you be able to give her any advice for some of the rogue royals? What's happening there? It seems like there's a lot of tumult. And you've been so good at keeping your kids together in a close-knit family.\\n\\nTRUMP: I think it's sad. I do. I think it's sad. She is a great woman. I sat with her. I was supposed to be with her 15 minutes, I stayed an hour- and-a-half. By the way, I got killed by the press. She wanted me to stay. The press had no, no, he was supposed to be there, it's very rude. We had a great time. Then we had dinner. We were honored. Our country was honored. I sat with her for a long time, and she was smiling and laughing the whole time.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Protocol is important for her. She has the tradition of the monarchy and the responsibilities.\\n\\nTRUMP: But we have a very great relationship. I think this was a blindside, she was blindsided by this whole situation, and I think it is too bad. But she has been, the Queen, it has to be an all-time record appeared. From the time she was 25, and now she's 94, she has never made a mistake, if you look. She's had like a flawless time.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Do you think Harry should go back, come back and fix this?\\n\\nTRUMP: I think -- I don't want to get into the whole thing. But I find it, I just have such respect for the Queen, I don't think this should be happening to her.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: IOC announced today, and this is our final question, Mr. President, just announced that no politics at the upcoming Olympics, new policy, by any of the athletes. Would you like to see that extended to the United States where politics stay out of sports? I know you are going to the big LSU-Clemson game.\\n\\nTRUMP: I am, and I was responsible for getting the Olympics. The Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. And I was called by the mayor, and he said, could you do us a favor when I was president-elect. And he said, could you do us, and I worked very hard, and we got the Olympics. And we have the World Cup coming into the United States. And I don't know, I guess you can say no politics, but people are going to talk politics. I think politics -- I do believe I have made politics somewhat more exciting. The New York Times would be dead right now. It would be out of business.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: What are they going to do without you?\\n\\nTRUMP: The Washington Post would be out of business. I hate to say it, but cable television would be obsolete. Cable television would be out of business. So we'll go hopefully another five years, and we'll keep everybody happy. Thank you very much.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Thank you so much. Fantastic.\\n\\nTRUMP: Thank you very much.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: President Trump offering his thoughts on the latest royal scandal across the pond, and banning political speech at the Olympics. FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo is at the White House with me for this exclusive interview today. He joins us now. Raymond, I think Trump looked like he was in fighting form today. Look, no one sleeps, he doesn't sleep, I don't sleep, nobody sleeps, but he is unbelievably resilient.\\n\\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He was on it, he was on it today. He was feisty, he had great humor. Laura, look, I always say his ability to greet opposition with a laugh and kind of diffuse people with that humor, that is a great quality to have in an office like this, particularly as you go into a campaign. He also went out of his way to take pictures with the entire team that was with us today. Unbelievable, really went out of his way. You made a lot of news in that interview lady. We learned that four embassies were targeted by Soleimani. For the first time he said the Iraqi government privately wants the U.S. to stay in their country. And he sounded off on Pelosi and the whole impeachment imbroglio. And for the first time, the president said he would invoke executive privilege to keep Bolton from testifying. Oh, and you and the president apparently our great sparring partner when it comes to Chinese and foreign workers coming into the country.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Foreign workers. The thing that he also said which didn't get a lot of play, but people should take note of, when I pressed him about whether, why not our troops out of Iraq? That is what he ran on. I said, would you be OK with that? He said that I'd be OK with that, but that's not --\\n\\nARROYO: Privately that's not what he saying.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, he basically said I would be OK with that, but he's pulled in between.\\n\\nARROYO: Speaking of buts, I want to turn back to what the president said about Harry and Meghan Markle's royal temper tantrum.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Megxit.\\n\\nARROYO: Or Megxit as they are calling it in the U.K. press. Madame Tussauds has separated Harry and Meghan, their wax works at least, from the rest of the royals at their --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nARROYO: They cordoned them off. They went away, bye-bye. That is what you call a big step back. The royal family is holed up in emergency meetings with Harry while Meghan is already in Canada. Meanwhile, the president is sticking up for the Queen, and CNN, Laura, had the most incredible coverage of the day. In their telling him it was racism that forced Megharry away.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's talk about whether race has played a role in this royal feud.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Prince Harry, he has complained about how his wife has been treated, and he has specifically said part of it is because of racism.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think she should come to North America. We are much more welcoming. We will embrace you.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: You know, it was not raised that through these two away. It was rude that ticked the royal family off. This is the duke and duchess sucking up to the celebrities. That's all they've ever done. Oprah has come out to support them. But look, if you want to trade on your title, you have to live up to the office. And the royals are not just liberties. There are public functions and responsibilities. But my take on this is the Queen, as the president rightly said, 65 years on the throne, she has taken them to World War II, the Falklands, Diana, Brexit. Meghan Markle is hardly a challenge for this lady. She will survive and so will the royals.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I think she is looking at this thing going oh, the petty squabbles of the youth.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nARROYO: But Laura, if they were racist, why would she let Harry marry her in the first place? They would have called the marriage off.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Why would Khizr (ph) Khan be the mayor of London? I mean, this is just ridiculous. It has nothing to do with that, but this is all the left has. They were talking about the Situation Room photo from the night that the Iranians were lobbing those roman candles toward out military installations, and they said, look at the Situation Room photo. Not diverse enough. Only one woman, Stephanie Grisham, all white men in the room. So this is their focus, not whether America is better off or not.\\n\\nARROYO: Or that the best people are around the table who are experts in the field. We have got to go to the Olympic message of the president. You asked about the International Olympics Committee saying we don't want any political displays during these medal ceremonies. The president kind of dodged your answer dodged your question a little bit. But I like this idea. It allows us to come together, lets sports be a means of bringing people together. Don't divide people with your political messages. I would like to see in the United States, not only in the Olympics.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I'd say shut up and compete.

The deadly strike on Iranian general Qassem Soleimani marks a major escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran raising fears of all-out war, the U.S. sending more than 4,000 additional troops to the Middle East this week as Iran promises to seek revenge. In a moment we'll speak live with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But first let's get the latest from Kevin Corke at the president's Mar-A-Lago retreat in Florida. Kevin.\\n\\nKevin Corke: Chris, the Iraqi parliament convenes an extraordinary session this Sunday. They're considering whether to ask the U.S. to withdraw troops from their country. Now that consideration comes just a couple of days after that American drone strike took out an Iranian general on Iraqi soil, sparking fears of a wider regional conflict. [begin video clip]\\n\\nKevin Corke: Over the weekend, Iraq's prime minister strongly criticized the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and prominently took part in the massive anti-U.S. protest in Baghdad. White House officials said it was Soleimani who directed the recent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and was responsible for killing hundreds of Americans worldwide. In Iran, a massive funeral procession through several cities to honor the slain general who many considered the second-most powerful man in the Islamic Republic. Overnight, President Trump tweeting, If Iran attacks an American base or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way. And threatening to strike 52 Iranian sites representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif responding, Targeting cultural sites is a war crime, and Iran's telecommunications minister called Trump a terrorist in a suit.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nAfter a two-week vacation here in Florida, the president makes his way back home, where he'll be considering entanglements abroad and a possible impeachment trial here in the states. Chris.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Kevin Corke reporting from Mar-A-Lago. Kevin, thank you. Joining us now here in Washington, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Welcome back to Fox News Sunday, sir.\\n\\nMike Pompeo: Chris, it's great to be with you. Thanks for having me on this morning.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Do you know that the Iraqi parliament is holding an emergency session today to discuss the question as to whether U.S. troops, the 5,000 troops we have there, should remain in country? It has just come across the wires the Iraqi prime minister says, It is in the interest of both Iraq and the U.S. to end foreign troop presence in Iraq, and he also says that the killing of General Soleimani and also a top militia leader who was backed by Iran, Muhandis, were political assassinations. Your reaction, sir.\\n\\nMike Pompeo: Chris, the American people should know that President Trump will never shy away from protecting and defending America. It's what we've done over these past weeks and days. It's what we've done over our entire three years with our Middle East strategy. The activity that you're seeing today is fully consistent with that. The American people should know we will continue. The president tweeted it again last night. We will take the actions necessary to keep Americans safe. You know, as for the activity today with respect to Iraq, we've been in their country. We've been supporting Iraqi sovereignty. We've been continuing to take down the terrorist threat against the Iraqi people. The prime minister is the resigned prime minister. He's the acting prime minister. He's under enormous threats from the very Iranian leadership that it is that we are pushing back against. We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign. And we'll continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe.\\n\\nChris Wallace: But if Iraq, it is a sovereign country, if they demand that we leave, one, will we leave? And if we do, won't that dramatically hurt the fight against ISIS and stability in the region?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: So, we'll have to take a look at what we do when the Iraqi leadership and government makes a decision, but the American people should know we'll make the right decision. We will take actions that, frankly, the previous administration refused to take to do just that.\\n\\nChris Wallace: President Trump says that General Soleimani was planning a imminent attack against Americans. You have said it was a big action that could potentially kill hundreds of American diplomats and soldiers. What was the plan? Who were the targets? And how soon?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: Yes. President Trump was right in what he said. So was I. We'll share all the intelligence if we can. I was the CIA director for a little while, Chris. There's things we simply cannot make public about what it is we knew at that time and what in fact we know today about the continuing activity. I think General Miller got it right when he said we would have been culpably negligent had we not gone after Soleimani when we had the opportunity. He was actively engaged and plotting against American interests. We need to look no further than what he had personally done over the days before that where an American was killed on December 27th. There's no surprise. There's plenty of public evidence about the bad behavior of Qassem Soleimani. He was a designated terrorist and we did the right thing.\\n\\nChris Wallace: I just want to press to this degree. The -- he had been targeting Americans and other people around the region for decades. The blood of 600 Americans was on his hands for -- during the Iraq war. The question is, that there are some intelligence agents who are talking to media outlets who are saying yes, he was doing bad things but it was another day in the Middle East and some congressional leaders who have been briefed now say that the intelligence was not of an imminent attack that was bigger, more worrisome. Don't the American people have the right to some understanding of what it was, why it was so urgent to take out Soleimani now?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: It's interesting. I haven't heard any of the congressional leaders who have seen the full set of intelligence make the comments that you just described. I think any reasonable person who saw the intelligence that the senior American leaders had in their possession would've come to the same conclusion that President Trump and our leadership team did about the fact that there would have been more risk to America, more risk through inaction than there was through the action that we took. I think it's very clear. I think it's very plain. We'll do everything we can to share this information with the American people, but I think the American people understand too, there's certain things you just can't -- you can't put out in public. You got to protect Americans who are out collecting the intelligence. The intelligence we will need in the days and weeks ahead to continue to defend and protect them.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Iran's leaders are vowing a crushing response using words like a hard revenge. What do we do if they strike back, if they retaliate? Is there a plan and is there -- because of the fact that we went after Soleimani -- has there been a change in U.S. response where we're no longer going to go after the enemy in the field we're now going to go after Iran's command and control.\\n\\nMike Pompeo: Well, Chris, the American people know that there's a strategy. There's a strategy that has been several years in the making now, that we've been working on. It's been a diplomatic strategy. It's been an economic strategy. You're now seeing elements of the military strategy. And with respect to targets, President Trump talked about 52 targets last night. That's not new in the following sense: we've made clear to the theocrats and kleptocrats that are running Iran today, running it into the ground against the will of their own people -- we made clear to them that we would not respond just against these proxy forces that they run, in Yemen, and in Syria, and in Iraq, and in Lebanon. We made clear that this cost would be brought home to them, to the leadership regime in Iran, and that we would raise costs. We wouldn't just attack their asymmetric efforts; we would respond in a way that imposes costs on the decision-makers who are putting American lives at risk.\\n\\nChris Wallace: So, you're saying to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, you're saying to President Rouhani, you're saying to leaders of the Revolutionary Guard, Don't think that you're off limits?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: What I'm saying is exactly what President Trump has said. We will take responses that are appropriate and commensurate with actions that threaten American lives. That's what we've done so far, Chris. There's no reason that the American people or the Iranian regime should ever expect we'll do anything different.\\n\\nChris Wallace: You talk about the strategy. The president has been pushing what he calls the maximum pressure strategy since he took office. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018. He imposed tough economic sanctions. And this summer, he suggested that the strategy was working. Take a look.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nPresident Trump: Iran is a much different country than two-and-a-half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sights of confliction. They were all over. And now, they just want to -- oh, they want to negotiate a deal so badly.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nChris Wallace: But in 2019 alone, Iran hit six ships, shot down a U.S. drone, launched an attack against Saudi oil facilities -- a damaging attack. And for all the talk of isolating Iran, they just conducted joint exercises with China and Russia. So, the question is, has the president's maximum pressure strategy made Iran less aggressive or more?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: Panicked aggression on the part of the Iranian leadership, because they know that the Iranian people are demanding enormous change. And they know that the Iranian people are supported by America in that demand for change. Yeah. We've built out a huge coalition, Chris. Gulf states, Israel, countries all across the whole world who are joining us. They are joining us not only in the efforts in the Strait of Hormuz, but in air defense efforts all across the region. The malign actor of Iran has been identified. Remember where we came in, Chris. Remember where we came in. In 2015, the Obama-Biden administration essentially handed power to the Iranian leadership and acted as a quasi-ally of theirs, by underwriting them -- underwriting the very malicious -- that killed Americans. Those resources, the money that they had to build out those forces throughout the Shi'a Crescent was provided to them by the nuclear deal. We allowed Europeans to go do business there. We provided them $150 billion, pallets of cash. All of these things are the very challenge that the Trump administration has had to correct. The strategy is working. We're going to stay the course. And we will protect and defend the American people at every step, Chris.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Just so you know, I will be asking Senator Van Hollen about that in the next segment. President Trump also says that he is keeping his campaign promise to pull U.S. troops out of the Middle East. Here's what he had to say in October.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nDonald Trump: The plan is to get out of endless wars, to bring our soldiers back home, to not be policing agents all over the world. It was a quick hit, except they stayed for almost 10 years. Let someone else fight over this long, blood-stained sand.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nChris Wallace: But just this week, this week, the U.S. deployed 100 Marines to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, plus 750 to the region, and now another 3,500. Is the president pulling us out of endless wars in the Middle East, or with this action this week, did he take a big step back in?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: Endless wars are the direct result of weakness, and President Trump will never let that happen. We're going to get it right. We're going to get the force posture right. We're going to get our facilities as hardened as we can possibly get them, to defend against what Iran may potentially do. But make no mistake: America's mission is to have our footprint in the Middle East reduced while still keeping America safe -- safe from rogue regimes like the Islamic Republic of Iran, and from terrorist activity, broadly, throughout the region.\\n\\nChris Wallace: So, is it fair to say that while the big strategy is to pull the U.S. out of endless wars, at least in the short term, there could be more of a commitment?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: The Obama administration created enormous risks to the American people in Iran. This administration is working to reduce that risk.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Finally, some analysts suggest that the impeachment of President Trump has emboldened enemies like Iran and North Korea to think that they can confront him. Do you think that, as misguided as it may be, that some of our enemies think that this president is more vulnerable because of the impeachment effort?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: You should ask Mr. Soleimani.\\n\\nChris Wallace: I understand that. But he was going ahead before you killed him. And the question is, do you think that impeachment is emboldening our enemies?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: I don't. I think that our adversaries understand that President Trump and our administration will do the right thing to protect American people, every place that we find risk.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Secretary Pompeo, thank you.\\n\\nMike Pompeo: Thank you, Chris.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Thanks for coming in on a very busy weekend, sir.\\n\\nMike Pompeo: You bet. Yes, sir. Thank you.\\n\\nChris Wallace: When we come back, Democrats raise questions about the wisdom and legality of the president's decision to take out Soleimani. We'll talk with a top Democratic senator, Chris Van Hollen. That's next.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nChris Wallace: The Senate returned, Friday, to its continuing stand-off over how and when to hold a trial after the impeachment of President Trump. And now, that's further complicated by the explosive developments with Iran. Joining us now here in Washington, Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Senator, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: Good to be with you, Chris.\\n\\nChris Wallace: As soon as the drone strike took out Soleimani, you and other Democrats started criticizing the action. President Trump and his top officials say that there was an imminent attack, and that that taking out Soleimani prevented it. You just heard Secretary Pompeo say that again on this program. Don't you believe them?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: I think we learned the hard way, Chris, in Iraq, in the Iraq war, that administrations sometimes manipulate and cherry-pick intelligence to further their political goals. That's what got us into the Iraq War. There was no WMD -- and --\\n\\nChris Wallace: Let me just interrupt. I understand that that's happened in the past. Are you saying it's happening now?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: I'm saying that they have an obligation to present the evidence. They did not notify the Gang of 8. The one opportunity they had, just two days ago, to brief senior staff at the top secret level, they provided no evidence to support their claim of an imminent threat. Look, everybody knows that Soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy. There's no debate there. But the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported. And what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting Americans at greater risk. In fact, Secretary Pompeo's own State Department, right after these attacks, urged Americans to leave Iraq. So, obviously, they thought it was a more dangerous situation there the day after than the day before, and as you've just reported, we sent 4,000 additional troops to Iraq, this from a president claiming he wants to get out of wars in the Middle East.\\n\\nChris Wallace: All right, but there's no question, and you certainly would agree, that Soleimani was our enemy. He had been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers during the Iraq war. There's no question that he was -- he wasn't taking a vacation as he was traveling around the Middle East this last week. He was making more plans for terror attacks, spreading Iran's malign influence. Why not kill him?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: Well, because you have to look at what the consequences are, right? We don't go around killing all the very bad people in the world. We have President Trump embracing Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea who's got a lot of blood on his hands and is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier, an American citizen, and yet he's getting love letters from the president of the United States. So, the question is, do we further our interests by killing Soleimani? And everything we've seen is we've actually increased the risks of war dramatically, we've put Americans at greater threat, and we seem to have accomplished Soleimani and the Iranians' main goal, which is to undermine our influence and support in Iraq. We now have the top Iraqi leadership, the president and the prime minister, condemning the United States' action. We have Parliament meeting to talk about expelling U.S. forces. What was Soleimani's main goal in Iraq? It was to get the Americans out, to undermine our influence. So, we seem to have accomplished what Soleimani was trying to do but couldn't, so in death he's actually accomplished his goal. That is a -- that turns back U.S. interests in the region.\\n\\nChris Wallace: You have been tweeting ever since the Soleimani takedown. Here's one of them. The Constitution makes clear that a president may not go to war without authorization from Congress, and we have not authorized war with Iran. But, Senator, the White House says this is not war, that Soleimani was a terrorist, and this was an act of self-defense, which a commander-in-chief can always take.\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: My point, Chris, is we're now headed very close to the precipice of war. You just heard the president this morning talk about targeting Iranian sites, including cultural sites, which is, in fact, a war crime if the president was to carry that out. The point we're making is that the president is not entitled under the Constitution to continue this escalation and take us to war without congressional action. That's what the Constitution requires. Look, I heard Secretary Pompeo talk about this. You asked him about the maximum pressure strategy. They've not accomplished any of their goals. They had very unrealistic goals. All they have done under maximum pressure is escalate the chance of war with Iran, something President Trump said he wanted to avoid, but a lot of people around him, like Secretary Pompeo, have been urging a confrontation with Iran for a very long time, including when he was a member of Congress.\\n\\nChris Wallace: I want to pick up on this, because here was another one of your tweets in the last couple of days. The administration's reckless policy over the last three years has brought us to the brink, but the president -- and you just heard Secretary Pompeo say, no, it was President Obama who brought us to the brink; it was the Obama nuclear deal which funneled billions of dollars back into the regime that they used to spread their brand of terror across the Middle East, and also, it was the Obama administration's decision to focus exclusively on the nuclear program and to ignore all the other malign activity by Iran throughout the region.\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: Well, first of all, they didn't ignore it, but the Obama administration correctly observed that a nuclear-armed Iran would be even more dangerous than an Iran that did not have nuclear weapons. And so, what this administration did was they ripped up that agreement, essentially divided us from our allies, and the result has been this increased actual activity from Iran in the region.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Well, not necessarily. I mean, you look at the reports that because of the fact that there are economic sanctions and Iran is economically strapped, that Hezbollah is starved for money, Hamas is starved for money. Isn't that a good thing?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: So, look, there's no doubt that the maximum pressure campaign is putting pressure on Iran, but to what end? Secretary Pompeo had a list of, like, 11 things the Iranian regime had to do, and it was never realistic, and that's why they've got no endgame. And that's why we're here right now, after this latest escalation, at much greater risk of going to war with Iran, which would be very damaging to the United States. Obviously, it would be damaging to Iran, but it would be very damaging to the United States.\\n\\nChris Wallace: All right --\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: Iran has continued to prosecute its efforts in Syria throughout the time of this administration, so the notion that they've succeeded in doing anything to stop Iran's malign influence is nonsense. What they have done is dramatically escalate the chance of war.\\n\\nChris Wallace: All right, I want to switch dramatically -- different subject. How long do you think that Speaker Pelosi should hold on to the articles of impeachment? Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has made it very clear, he's not going to be cowed by her, he's not going to be pressured by her; the Senate is going to run its own trial. At some point, doesn't she have to hand over the articles, and for the good of the country, doesn't the Senate have to get on with a trial?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: Well, Speaker Pelosi has made very clear she will send over the articles of impeachment.\\n\\nChris Wallace: When?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: She's also been --\\n\\nChris Wallace: Wait, wait. When?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: When she feels it's appropriate, and I think that, you know, that will happen. But the issue, Chris, is that we have a constitutional duty in the Senate to have a trial, and it needs to be a fair trial, and every American recognizes that a fair trial means you get to call witnesses, you get to have relevant documents. We've seen in the last two weeks more emails that have surfaced that show this Trump administration trying to cover up key emails showing that the president of the United States -- confirming again, he ordered the hold on vital U.S. Ukrainian military assistance. And so, why not get those documents? President Trump himself said that he wants Mulvaney to testify. He said that months ago. Why shouldn't we have witnesses? That is the question.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Okay, I've got one last question. I've got less than a minute for you to answer. Do you have any concerns about holding this trial right now with the president in this growing confrontation with Iran and potentially an international crisis? Is that a good thing for the Senate to be trying whether or not to remove the president at this particular moment?\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: We have a constitutional duty -- when it comes to the issues of war, Congress and the Constitution has the power to declare war despite what the president may think, and we have a constitutional duty to try the president in an impeachment trial when the House of Representatives sends us the articles of impeachment.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Even --\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: I think our system is strong enough that we can do both. I very much worry about what the president is doing right now to escalate tensions and the likelihood of war in Iran, but our country will have to deal with both these issues at the same time.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Senator Van Hollen, thank you. Thanks for coming in today, sir.\\n\\nChris Van Hollen: Thank you.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what happens next in the growing confrontation with Iran. Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump's decision to kill General Soleimani? Just go to Facebook or Twitter at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on the air.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nChris Wallace: With the world on edge over possible retaliation after the U.S. killed Iran's top military leader, we want to replay part of an interview we conducted with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani back in September. He said then, It's not Iran that's the main sponsor of terrorism, but the U.S.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nMale Translator: Today America unfortunately is the supporter of terrorism in our region and wherever America has gone terrorism has expanded in the wake. Wherever we have gone on the other side we have defeated terrorism.\\n\\nChris Wallace: You have given hundreds of millions, perhaps a billion dollars to Hezbollah, to Hamas, to various groups. That is not a support of terrorism? Hassan Rouhani Well, when you label people who fight for the defense of their country and their lands as terrorism. So, those who are the subjects of occupation what should they do? Be passive and just look?\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nChris Wallace: And it's time now for our Sunday group. Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and former Trump national security council spokesperson, Michael Anton. Michael, does the decision to escalate dramatically and I think we would agree it was a dramatic escalation to take out Qassem Soleimani, does it make the U.S. more safe or less safe and if Iran decides as -- keeps its promise to retaliate dramatically, does the Trump administration have a strategy?\\n\\nMichael Anton: I don't know that I necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. You could interpret it as justified retaliation for all kinds of things that you've talked about earlier in the program that Iran has been doing without much of a response. So the main point I would want to make here is the Iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation, and when they finally do get pushback, they tend to back down and go into the turtle mode for a little while and that may yet happen again. We've seen that happen in the past. They haven't faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the Iran deal all around the Middle East, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they, I think, got overconfident and to some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that Soleimani went right into Iran and the airport -- sorry, into Iraq in the airport completely confident that he owned the place and that nothing would happen to him. So, I think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to maybe make the regime retreat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.\\n\\nChris Wallace: All right. We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of the president's decision to take out Soleimani we got this on Facebook from Phil Martin. What is the difference between what President Trump did and what former President Obama did to Osama bin Laden? Congresswoman Edwards, how do you answer Phil?\\n\\nDonna Edwards: Well, I mean, there are two main differences and one is that Osama bin Laden was a non-state actor and here you have an attack directly in the Iraqi -- Iranian hierarchy and look, nobody's out there, you know, saying that Soleimani was not a bad guy. He was a bad actor, had been for a couple of decades, but the question is whether this was the smartest way in which to conduct an overall foreign policy in the region and whether -- and I believe it has actually made the region and the United States interests a lot more vulnerable.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Well, let me just pose this then. So, they -- Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launch a number of strikes last -- the week before last, I think it was a week ago Friday and kill an American contractor and hurt a number of American soldiers. We respond with a number of strikes that kill about two dozen of those militia men. They then attack our embassy. No, they didn't kill anybody, but it was pretty shocking what they did to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Are we supposed to just let it go?\\n\\nDonna Edwards: Well, what I'm saying to you is that I think among the options, the range of options, that the president has, the question is, do you take one and I believe they did in taking the action in killing Soleimani that actually, you know, the downstream puts us in a much more difficult position and I don't -- and I think right now, it's not really clear to me that just like pulling out of the Iran deal, that this administration has said -- has mapped out what the end game is, what's the next part of this strategy.\\n\\nChris Wallace: All right.\\n\\nDonna Edwards: And I think without that, then the United States interest and our ability of our allies to stand with us in this becomes much more complicated.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Josh, I want to move to a different aspect of the questions that people are asking this week. President Trump very publicly and has reaffirmed it as recently as this fall that the situation in Syria ran on getting the U.S. out of endless wars in the Middle East. But as I discussed with Secretary Pompeo, this week alone he sent more than 4,000 U.S. troops into the region. So, are we getting out? Are we getting deeper?\\n\\nJosh Holmes: Well, I don't think that's inconsistent at all. I mean, I think his overarching policy as Secretary Pompeo articulated very clearly is to remove America from these endless wars and these conflicts in Syria, the conflicts in Iraq and beyond, but that also cannot override immediate security threats. You need to be responsive to that and I will just say, I'm totally stunned at the notion that somehow America is the one that is bringing this to a higher escalation level. The president's critics may not have been paying attention to what's happened over the last couple of years, but just because they're more focused on trying to impeach the president of the United States than the health and well-being of American soldiers in Iraq, doesn't mean that things aren't happening. This guy has tried -- has killed over 600 American soldiers, all right? Just last week, we watched him storm the embassy in Baghdad. Now, how America is the aggressor here is beyond me but what they did is for the first time in a long time, and I'll argue that the president has been extremely reluctant to engage in this kind of thing, but first time in a long time tell Iran not anymore. You're not going to be attacking American assets or American personnel without severe repercussions and I think that's a great thing for this country.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Well, here is how the president described and explained his action on Friday.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nDonald Trump: We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nChris Wallace: Mo, what about the argument that, as I've recited in the interviews with the two previous guests, that there are a number of actions that Iran has taken this year going after ships, shooting down a drone, attacking Saudi oil facilities; just in the last week they killed an American contractor, hurt -- badly injured a number of American soldiers, and then stormed the U.S. embassy. What about the argument that President Trump needed to stand up to this Iranian aggression and show resolve?\\n\\nMo Elleithee: Yeah, it's interesting. One of the president's rationales for withdrawing from the Iran deal was that by doing so and imposing these crippling economic sanctions on the regime, it would bring the regime to its knees. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. The regime has become more and more emboldened and has done -- has been escalating its rhetoric. Look, my concern here is, and as others have said, is what are the ramifications regionally? This was not our first opportunity to go after this guy. Stan McChrystal, who was no -- you know, who was fired by President Obama, he was no fan of Obama foreign policy.\\n\\nChris Wallace: He was one of the top generals and he was at one point leading our effort in Afghanistan.\\n\\nMo Elleithee: Talks openly about the time he had an opportunity to take him out but that there were bigger regional concerns. We're going to --\\n\\nChris Wallace: He now says he thinks the president -- President Trump made the right decision.\\n\\nMo Elleithee: Well, we'll see, right? I mean, if you look at what just happened moments before this panel came on the air where the Iraqi prime minister standing before the Iraqi parliament called this a political assassination and that the United States should withdraw all troops from the country. This is -- there is now a huge mess on the ground in the Middle East. And the United States is going to have to be ready for that. The fact that --\\n\\nChris Wallace: Okay.\\n\\nMale Speaker: -- the government -- the president has to be ready for all these unknown --\\n\\nChris Wallace: I --\\n\\nMale Speaker: -- moving pieces --\\n\\nChris Wallace: He absolutely does. I've got about a minute left in this segment. And Michael, I want to leave it with you. You've posited that, maybe, they needed a punch in the nose, and now they're going to pull back. And they've gotten too aggressive. There's a flip side of that. What if Iraq goes ahead and expels U.S. troops? What if Iran -- and that certainly is much of a possibility as your scenario -- strikes back? What do we do then?\\n\\nMichael Anton: Well, if the Iraqis decide they want U.S. troops to lead, one thing I could say with confidence is President Trump will not be on the phone begging them to say, Please let us stay. He'll call their bluff. And I think the Iraqi leadership knows that the big winners of that will not be Iraq, necessarily; it'll be Iran. And so --\\n\\nChris Wallace: I understand. But that --\\n\\nMichael Anton: -- so --\\n\\nChris Wallace: -- would hurt us, wouldn't it, if Iran is -- takes more over control of Iraq?\\n\\nMichael Anton: Well, as you said earlier, the president really would like to get as much out of the Middle East as possible. But he didn't run as an isolationist. It's important to remember: he ran as kind of a Jacksonian. His philosophy of foreign policy is very simple. Live and let live. We will live and let live as much as possible. But if you hit us, if you mess with us, if you strike us, if you kill our people, we will hit back very, very hard. That's why, what he -- what he's doing is essentially retaliatory. It's not long-term nation building. He has no interest in staying in the Middle East, or rebuilding it, or transforming it for the long term.\\n\\nJosh Holmes: But does that mean we would cede control of Iraq, after all we've put into that and all we've lost --\\n\\nMale Speaker: We can't [unintelligible] --\\n\\nMichael Anton: It is a sovereign country, as you have -- and others have said. If the Iraqi-elected government says, We don't want you there, we don't have a way to stay, and the president's not going to beg them to say.\\n\\nChris Wallace: We have to take a break here, panel, because we've got more to talk about. When we come back: Democrats' state of play on trying to remove President Trump. How long can Nancy Pelosi hang onto the articles of impeachment and hold up a Senate trial?\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nMitch McConnell: Their turn is over. They've done enough damage. It's the Senate's turn now to render sober judgment as the framers envisioned.\\n\\nChuck Schumer: There has never, never, in the history of our country, been an impeachment trial of the president in which the Senate was denied the ability to hear from witnesses.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nChris Wallace: With the Senate back in session, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer making no progress in agreeing on ground rules for an impeachment trial of President Trump. And we're back now with the panel. So, Josh, where are we on a Senate trial? Is your former boss there, Mitch McConnell, is he going to hold firm and say, Nancy Pelosi, you're not going to dictate what's going to happen here? And secondly, you had -- over the recess, you had two Republican senators -- Collins and Murkowski -- both express concerns about McConnell's hardline stance. What do you think of the chances that McConnell holds firm, that you could get them and maybe two other Republicans -- which would give Democrats, potentially, a majority -- to call witnesses and basically run the kind of trial the Democrats want to?\\n\\nJosh Holmes: Well, first off, this whole thing is kind of confusing to me, as to why Nancy Pelosi believes that it increases her leverage, by holding the papers. I mean, every day that she holds them, they look more and more bizarre. And the closer and closer that they get to the Iowa caucuses -- which, of course, throws off the closing arguments for every 2020 Democrat running against President Trump, ultimately -- but secondly, she has no leverage here. This is not about trying to control the contours of the Senate. She's never going to be able to do that. So, this ends only one way; and that's when she sends the papers over without any kind of preconditions. That's basically what McConnell said this week.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Okay. And what about my second question, which is, if you -- you've got 47 Democrats. If they were to get four Republicans, they'd have 51. They'd have a majority -- assuming they all vote together. And then they could call Mick Mulvaney. They could call John Bolton. What's the prospect of that?\\n\\nJosh Holmes: Yeah. I mean, that's, like, the if and -- ifs and buts, and candy and nuts, [unintelligible] Christmas in every day. There's no chance of that happening. Let me tell you why -- specifically because what McConnell was advocating for is an imminently reasonable process, one that was adopted 100 to nothing in the Clinton impeachment trial in the 1990s. And what that does is provide the impeachment managers from the House and the president's defense team the opportunity to lay out their cases. And what is agreed to at the front end is that framework. After you get through that framework, then senators are -- after they go through a series of questioning, are able to look at what's missing. And at that point, you can have a discussion about whether you bring in different pieces of evidence, whether you bring --\\n\\nChris Wallace: Like witnesses.\\n\\nJosh Holmes: Right. And so, the question is, as -- are we concerned -- is there a concern that senators are ultimately going to back a Democratic proposal to lay out this entire thing on the front end?\\n\\nChris Wallace: Right.\\n\\nJosh Holmes: No, no. Absolutely not, because what it does it create complete chaos. And I've got to tell you: Democrats don't want it either because they're a lot closer to getting 51 for Hunter Biden than they are for anybody in the Trump administration.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Congresswoman Edwards, how long can Nancy Pelosi hang on to these articles of impeachment? I mean, it was the Democrats -- it was Pelosi, it was Schiff -- who said Donald Trump -- we've got to move forward because he is a clear and present danger. Now they are the ones holding up the process to remove him.\\n\\nDonna Edwards: Well, no. I mean, I think we should examine that where we are right now is precisely because Mitch McConnell openly said that he wasn't going to have a fair process. And I think it's legitimate for Speaker Pelosi to actually keep open this process as long as she needs to. I mean, she's going to turn over the articles of impeachment, but she does want assurances, given that McConnell came out straightforwardly and said he wasn't going to have a fair process and that he was coordinating with the president. And so, you know, and I think that she actually has created leverage, because, in fact, she opened up the space for Murkowski and Collins. And I'm waiting for this phase -- for Mitt Romney, who stands nothing to gain in this process by aligning himself with the administration, with the president -- to make sure that there is, indeed, a fair process.\\n\\nChris Wallace: All right. We're going to continue. We'll have plenty of time to continue that conversation. Let's turn to the Democratic presidential campaign, because we just got the fourth quarter, the end of 2019 fundraising numbers for all of the Democratic candidates, and they're pretty interesting. Put them up on the screen. Bernie Sanders led the field in the fourth quarter, raising $34.5 million. Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and Elizabeth Warren are closely bunched about $10 million behind, and then it's another $5 million back to Andrew Yang. Mo, how do you handicap the race at this point?\\n\\nMo Elleithee: It's jump ball. I mean, look, Iowa is going to winnow the field to some extent. You know, typically people historically have talked about two or three tickets out of Iowa. You could have as many as four or five out of Iowa this next time, and it's anybody's game. Those are tremendous numbers for Bernie Sanders, but they're tremendous numbers for everyone in the field. The biggest question heading into Iowa just under 30 days from now is, will those senators that are running -- Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker -- will they be able to be on the ground in Iowa, or are they going to be stuck here in Washington? And for someone like an Amy Klobuchar or an Elizabeth Warren who are, like, right there, right? They're right there to get one of those tickets. They can't afford to cede weeks of ground to someone like Vice President Biden or Mayor Buttigieg.\\n\\nChris Wallace: So, maybe this is Nancy Pelosi's strategy. Hold up the Senate trial so they can campaign.\\n\\nMo Elleithee: My guess is it's not that. That's not it. But it is going to be a real issue.\\n\\nChris Wallace: We should point out that while they were raising that amount of money, Donald Trump in the fourth quarter raised $46 million, far more than any of the others. He's built up a huge campaign war chest, has more than $100 million cash on hand, which raises the question, Michael, how big an advantage for the president, how big a disadvantage for the Democrats, that he's building up this war chest, just sitting there, basically? He's got a couple of people running against him, but nobody serious, while the Democrats, with the money they've raised, which is impressive, are going to spend all of it going after each other.\\n\\nMichael Anton: Well, it's been a long time since an incumbent president was defeated for reelection: 1992. There's enormous advantages to incumbency.\\n\\nChris Wallace: And he faced a primary challenger.\\n\\nMichael Anton: And he faced a primary challenger, and it also took a third-party independent, who got the highest independent vote in U.S. history, at least in the 20th century. So --\\n\\nChris Wallace: [unintelligible]\\n\\nMichael Anton: -- it was an extraordinary confluence of circumstances that don't look to be repeated, and President Bush, who was defeated in 1992, also faced a very bad economy, which is -- remember, it's the economy, stupid -- the number-one issue Bill Clinton ran against him on and was able to seize on. The Democrats don't have that right now. I think, you know, anything is possible. The economy could turn sour sometime during this year, but at this point in the 1992 campaign the economy had already been in recession for a while, and people were very discontented. That's not the case right now. So, President Trump looks very strong to me.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Congresswoman Edwards, when you look at not just the money but also the polls, I mean, the thing that I have to say surprised me, Bernie Sanders had a heart attack in the fourth quarter, and there was a lot of talk about that the party wasn't going to go as far left, that they were pulling the voters; they were pulling back to the center. You saw the rise of Buttigieg, Biden with considerable strength. There are a lot of people out there that still support and are giving money to Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nDonna Edwards: Well, there are. I mean, he's shown, you know, resilience and energy. But I would say that Joe Biden has actually shown a lot of resiliency, too, for all the attacks and for all the talks of the demise of his campaign. I look to see a resurgence, frankly, of somebody like an Elizabeth Warren. She's got money on hand, she's got a ground game in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, and has the ability to organize that forward. And then Amy Klobuchar, I think you're right. I mean, she's on the rise, but she can't afford to be taken off the field.\\n\\nChris Wallace: You realize you haven't winnowed at all. [laughter]\\n\\nDonna Edwards: I haven't at all.\\n\\nChris Wallace: You haven't winnowed out; you've winnowed in.\\n\\nDonna Edwards: I'm not ready -- I'm like most voters. I'm not ready to do that quite yet. But I do look at the collective energy in the Democratic field. You can see that in the fundraising, where collectively the field still seems to be able to demonstrate that, from small donors across the board, that Democrats do still have the, you know, wind at their sails.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Thirty seconds, Josh. Who in that field is the biggest threat to Donald Trump and the reelection campaign?\\n\\nJosh Holmes: Oh, I don't think we know yet. I think they all have vulnerabilities, I think some unique vulnerabilities. I think the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing in the midst of a really good economy is absolutely devastating for Democrats. I don't know how you make the case that you change the American economy when you're doing this [unintelligible].\\n\\nChris Wallace: So, basically, they're all going to lose, right?\\n\\nJosh Holmes: So, that's what I'm saying.\\n\\nChris Wallace: [laughs] All right. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Up next, our Power Player of the Week, the man who serves as the ambassador from Hollywood to right here in the nation's capital.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nChris Wallace: Hollywood's awards season kicks off tonight with the Golden Globe Awards, and it's shaping up to be a big year for Netflix, the streaming service that used to be an outsider in the movie industry. We spoke with an insider who's working to change that. He's our Power Player of the Week.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\n[music playing]\\n\\nCharles Rivkin: This is the place in Washington, D.C. where Hollywood meets Washington.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Charlie Rivkin is talking about the Motion Picture Association, one of D.C.'s most powerful lobbying groups --\\n\\nMale Speaker: Action.\\n\\nChris Wallace: -- which advocates for the film, TV, and streaming industry.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Two-point-six million Americans wake up every single day and go to jobs that are supported by this business.\\n\\nChris Wallace: The MPA's members are Hollywood's elite studios like Disney and Warner Brothers, and now, Netflix. Why did you push so hard for Netflix to join the MPA?\\n\\nCharles Rivkin: I believe the MPA should be the home of the leading content creators on the planet, and clearly Netflix is.\\n\\nFemale Speaker: Netflix.\\n\\nMale Speaker: Netflix.\\n\\nFemale Speaker: Netflix.\\n\\nChris Wallace: This year Netflix scored 17 Golden Globe nominations.\\n\\nMale Speaker: Would you like to be a part of history?\\n\\nMale Speaker: Yes.\\n\\nChris Wallace: More than double any other studio.\\n\\nMale Speaker: It's what it is.\\n\\nChris Wallace: But Rivkin says the streaming giant is a partner, not a rival of the silver screen.\\n\\nFemale Speaker: Enjoy your movie.\\n\\nChris Wallace: What about the owners of movie theaters?\\n\\nCharles Rivkin: The more technologically savvy the consumer is, the more he's likely to go to the movies. So, I don't believe there's cannibalization.\\n\\nChris Wallace: For decades, the MPA was led by power broker and our first-ever Power Player. Jack Valenti.\\n\\nJack Valenti: I thought, Movies, television, wow. That's what I'd like to do for the rest of my life, and by jingoes, I've darn near done it.\\n\\nChris Wallace: The industry has changed dramatically since then, and so has the MPA. The headquarters reopened this fall and now features iconic movie props.\\n\\nCharles Rivkin: This is Elton John's Gucci jacket, signed by Elton John, and it was worn in the film. And here, the original Aqua Man outfit. Here's our new theater --\\n\\nChris Wallace: But the MPA's secret weapon has always been its movie theater --\\n\\nCharles Rivkin: This is state of the art.\\n\\nChris Wallace: -- where Washington politicians enjoy private screenings of new releases.\\n\\nCharles Rivkin: The last theater was -- when it was built, was good for its time. This is 120 seats. We had to have the best screening room in all of D.C.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Rivkin's father was an ambassador; his godfather, former senator and then Vice President Hubert Humphrey. But Rivkin chose entertainment over politics, becoming the first person to run the Jim Henson Company outside of that family.\\n\\nKermit: Hello.\\n\\nMultiple Speakers: Yippee.\\n\\nChris Wallace: But Washington called, President Obama appointing him ambassador to France. He brought Hollywood with him, hosting stars like Clint Eastwood, Jodie Foster, and Samuel L. Jackson, who met with young immigrants there.\\n\\nCharles Rivkin: He talked about his story, the American story. He's the embodiment of the American dream.\\n\\nChris Wallace: Rivkin says he's lived his own dream. Charles Rivkin: I went from working from Kermit and Miss Piggy to the president of the United States. For me, joining a hundred-year-old institution and helping to modernize it for our new era, this new incredible golden age of content, is very satisfying. [end video clip]\\n\\nChris Wallace: Despite the popularity of home streaming, movie theaters remain packed. The domestic box office for 2019 is projected to be more than $11 billion. And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next Fox News Sunday.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"original": "Killer robots are taking over. Also known as autonomous weapons, these devices, once activated, can destroy targets without human intervention.\\n\\nThe technology has been with us for years. In 1959, the US Navy started using the Phalanx Close-In Weapon System, an autonomous defense device that can spot and attack anti-ship missiles, helicopters and similar threats. In 2014, Russia announced that killer robots would guard five of its ballistic missile installations. That same year, Israel deployed the Harpy, an autonomous weapon that can stay airborne for nine hours to identify and pick off enemy targets from enormous distances. In 2017, China introduced its own Harpy-type weapon.\\n\\nBut, with the US's plans to launch drones based on the X-47B in 2023, the invasion of killer robots is going to a new level. These stealth, jet-powered autonomous aircraft can aerially refuel and penetrate deep inside a well-defended territory to gather intelligence and strike enemy targets, a more aggressively lethal tool than we've seen before.\\n\\nIs it ethical to deploy killer robots? The International Human Rights Clinic at Harvard Law School says no, arguing that artificially intelligent weapons fail to comply with the principles of humanity and the dictates of public conscience in the Geneva Convention.\\n\\nAware of the resistance to killer robots, the US Department of Defense issued Directive 3000.09, which requires that weapons be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force. The word appropriate requires a human operator be in-the-loop (i.e., control the weapon) or on-the-loop (i.e., supervise the weapon) and have the final say in taking human lives. As a result, the Navy currently only uses the X-47B prototype in a semiautonomous mode, always keeping a human operator involved.\\n\\nThe pace of war is escalating exponentially, driven by the increasing use of computer technology. As the arms race continues, the potential for an unintended conflict is going up. As seen during the Cold War between the US and Russia, we came dangerously close to nuclear war on a number of occasions. Only human judgment averted all-out armageddon.\\n\\nSo, where does this leave us?\\n\\nAs I outlined in my book Genius Weapons, there are only three ways to ensure killer robots are kept in check:\\n\\nFocus autonomous weapons on defense, not offense. In a defensive role, autonomous weapon systems have the potential to lower the probability of conflict. For example, if the United States deployed autonomous weapons that could destroy any missile targeted to hit the US or its allies, a potential adversary would judge such an attack as futile and avoid conflict.\\n\\nFocus on semiautonomous weapons, as is current US policy. Semiautonomous weapons requiring a human either in-the-loop or on-the-loop injects human judgment and provides some assurance that weapons will be able to discern combatants from non-combatants. It also adds accountability, which aligns with international humanitarian law.\\n\\nLimit which weapons we give autonomy to. It would be reckless to make weapons of mass destruction autonomous. If nations of the world automate their nuclear tipped missiles, one erroneous line of computer code could ignite World War III. It's critical that nations like the US and Russia, which have the capability to destroy the Earth, follow the policy. Thankfully, North Korea doesn't have a nuclear capacity anywhere close to the US and Russia, nor even does China at this time.\\n\\nAs current AI technology is unable to replicate human judgment, all nations must adopt these three measures now and for good. Anything less threatens the survival of humanity.\\n\\nLouis A. Del Monte is the author of Genius Weapons: Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Weaponry, and the Future of Warfare (Prometheus Books), out now.\\n\\nThis story originally appeared in the New York Post."}
{"original": "House Passes Broadcast Decency Bill\\n\\nThursday , March 11, 2004\\n\\nBy Liza Porteus\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nWASHINGTON —\\n\\nBefore the bill passed with overwhelming support, House lawmakers debated the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004 (search), which increases the penalties for violations by television and radio broadcasters for allowing obscene, indecent and profane language on the air.\\n\\nI think it's imperative that we get this bill to the president's desk as fast as we can, said Rep. Fred Upton (search), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet.\\n\\nCurrent indecency rules prohibit over-the-air radio and TV stations from airing material that refers to sexual and excretory functions between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., when children may be tuned in. The Federal Communications Commission (search) already has said it will begin fining broadcasters for each indecent incident.\\n\\nAlthough the Senate and House bills boosting the fines were introduced before this year's controversial Super Bowl halftime show, the escapades aired that night were definitely the rallying point.\\n\\nThe halftime show ended with singer Justin Timberlake exposing Janet Jackson's breast to 90 million viewers. What was described as a wardrobe malfunction had media decency advocates, parents and others up in arms, especially since it was repeated over and over on public television, talk shows and news broadcasts.\\n\\nThe halftime show was full of crude and sexually explicit performances, Texas Democratic Rep. Martin Frost (search) said on the House floor Thursday. Throughout the day, we were subjected also to some offensive ads -- all this was going on in our gyms, our living rooms, places we gather every year to watch the Super Bowl.\\n\\nFrost noted that one in five children were watching the biggest sporting event of the year during the bare-all performance, but said we shouldn't be singling out the Super Bowl broadcast for our disapproval.\\n\\nRadio shows, family-hour cable programming that toes the line between what's appropriate and what's not appropriate for kids and other outlets also need to be reined in, he said.\\n\\nUpton, a Michigan Republican, introduced the bill on Jan. 21 and a week later, it won the support of the White House. The legislation has wide bipartisan support and nearly 100 members of Congress have co-sponsored the measure.\\n\\nOther highlights of the bill:\\n\\n--Raises maximum fine against a broadcast license-holder from $27,500 to $500,000.\\n\\n--Increases maximum fine against a performer from $11,000 to $500,000 and allows the Federal Communications Commission to impose the penalty after the first offense. Under current rules, the FCC must wait for a second offense.\\n\\n--Orders FCC to act on indecency complaints within 180 days after they are received.\\n\\n--Mandates FCC to consider revoking license of any broadcaster found with three indecency violations.\\n\\n--Exempts affiliates from indecency fines if the program was supplied by the network and the individual stations did not have a chance to review it in advance or, if in the case of a live broadcast, had no reason to suspect it could be indecent.\\n\\n--Expresses the sense of Congress that broadcasters should set aside an hour in prime time to air family-friendly programming.\\n\\nRep Ed Markey (search), D-Mass., a main co-sponsor of the bill, chastised the FCC for not using the enforcement tools it has as its disposal -- such as revoking station licenses -- to be a more aggressive enforcer of current decency rules.\\n\\nIn fact, he said, testimony from FCC Chairman Michael Powell (search) has showed that cases from two to three years ago of broadcasters violating the rules are still languishing.\\n\\nIt appears as though the industry has largely concluded that the FCC is a paper tiger, Markey said. The rare and paltry fines the commission assess have become nothing more than a joke within the broadcast industry.\\n\\nSome Democrats, however, said the bigger problem is the increasing amount of media consolidation, or fewer media companies controlling more programming.\\n\\nThese media giants are the biggest offenders of indecency, said Rep. Bart Stupak (search), D-Mich.\\n\\nThere's no question that indecency in the media is a disease that's infecting all of society, said Rep. Maurice Hinchey (search), D-N.Y. But this bill deals only with the symptoms of the problem and not with the underlying cause, which, he said, is having fewer owners of the airwaves.\\n\\nThe fact is, higher fines are going to do nothing, added Rep. David Obey (search), D-Wis., saying more local ownership of television stations is what's most needed.\\n\\nIf you really want to do something to give communities the ability to stop this nonsense, you will take away from the FCC the ability to put broadcast power in the hands of a few corporations ... people don't want to see this garbage.\\n\\nThe bills are S. 2056 and H.R. 3717.\\n\\nEdward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, noted that the industry has already scheduled an indecency summit for March 31.\\n\\nVoluntary industry initiatives are far preferable to government regulation when dealing with programming issues, Fritts said. NAB does not support the bill as written, but we hear the call of legislators and are committed to taking voluntary action to address this issue.\\n\\nClear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio station chain, touted its own actions.\\n\\nThe company now has a 20-second delay for live broadcasts, announced new standards for its programs, suspended its broadcasts of the Howard Stern show (search) and fired the disc jockey known as Bubba the Love Sponge, (search) whose programs brought the chain a record $755,000 fine for indecency.\\n\\nWe hope never to face these higher fines because of the strong policy we've put in place, said executive vice president Andrew Levin. To the extent it provides an incentive for other broadcasters who have not adopted voluntary guidelines to comply with the law, it may be a good thing.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "President Trump stood firm Friday on his demands for a border wall after the second White House meeting with congressional leaders this week broke up with no apparent deal, warning Democrats the partial government shutdown could last years and saying he could even declare a national emergency to bypass Congress if necessary.\\n\\nWe can call a national emergency [to build a border wall] because of the security of our country, Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden, during a lengthy and impromptu press conference.\\n\\nI may do it, he said, before adding, If we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving it a shot.\\n\\nThe press conference underscored how far apart both sides are, even as Trump called the meeting productive and suggested the standoff could end soon -- or not. He indicated he was not shifting on his demand for more than $5 billion for funding for a wall on the southern border, saying it was necessary as the border is a dangerous, horrible disaster.\\n\\nThis is national security we're talking about, we're not talking about games, he told reporters. We're not playing games, we have to do it.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nDespite Trump saying conversations had come a long way, Democrats were more dour in their assessment. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer exited saying Trump told them he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.\\n\\nTrump later confirmed in the Rose Garden, Absolutely I said that, while clarifying he hopes the partial shutdown doesn't last more than a few more days. He said it could be opened very quickly if they come to an agreement on the wall. He offered some flexibility only on what the wall would be made of, saying it could be concrete or steel.\\n\\nSteel is more expensive than the concrete, but I feel like we're talking about steel because the other side feels better about it, he said.\\n\\nYet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democrats' view is that they cannot resolve the funding dispute until the government fully opens. She said there had been progress only in the sense of a better understanding of each other.\\n\\nLooking for an elusive resolution, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Trump agreed to designate staff to engage in negotiations with congressional leadership aides this weekend. Trump later said the group would determine what we're going to do about the border. That group would include Vice President Pence and advisor Jared Kushner.\\n\\nThe meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump's promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives. Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall.\\n\\nTrump met with Democratic and Republican leaders of both chambers. Ahead of the meeting Trump sent a letter to members of Congress congratulating Pelosi on her election as speaker and calling on Congress to re-open the government.\\n\\nAs we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders, he said. It is the sovereign right of every nation to establish an immigration program in its national interest—lawfully admitting those who have followed the rules, while denying entry to those who break the rules or fail to meet the requirements established in law.\\n\\nAs part of his strategy, he made available to every member a presentation on border security that he said those present at a meeting Wednesday did not want to hear.\\n\\nAmericans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration. Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first, he wrote.\\n\\nDemocrats, meanwhile, passed legislation in the House that would fund the whole government, but not the wall. Pelosi accused Republicans of holding government workers hostage for the separate demand of a wall.\\n\\nThe wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other, Pelosi said at an MSNBC Town Hall.\\n\\nThere is no reason to have workers pay a price with their paycheck, she said\\n\\nThe legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership. McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills a time-wasting act of political posturing and said that a resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.\\n\\nHOUSE DEMS MOVE TO ELIMINATE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, LIMIT PRESIDENTIAL PARDON POWER AND MORE IN FIRST DAYS BACK\\n\\nWe need to make policy rather than simply making political theatre, he told reporters.\\n\\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Fox & Friends earlier Friday that it would be up to Pelosi to get her party behind her, including the left flank pushing for impeachment.\\n\\nWe think we're hopeful because the people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games, she said. They elected her to find real solutions and actually work with the president and work with all members of Congress to get things done.\\n\\nOn Thursday night, Pence said on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight that the terms of the negotiations were clear: Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.\\n\\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report."}

{"original": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday said that President Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts will be blocked indefinitely, and for at least the next two weeks before Inauguration Day.\\n\\nWe believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, Zuckerberg said in a statement Thursday. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.\\n\\nTRUMP DELETES CAPITOL TWEETS THAT SENT ACCOUNT INTO LOCKDOWN, WILL REGAIN ACCESS AFTER 12 HOUR SUSPENSION\\n\\nZuckerberg's statement came after Facebook had initially told Fox News that Trump would regain access to his Facebook Thursday night after he was temporarily suspended due to policy violations.\\n\\nFacebook suspended the president's account for the first time Wednesday night after posting a video telling protesters who stormed the Capitol Building, erupting in violent protests that led to multiple deaths, to go home, while maintaining that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.\\n\\nZuckerberg, in the statement, said that the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden.\\n\\nHis decision to use his platform to condone rather than condemn the actions of his supporters at the Capitol building has rightly disturbed people in the US and around the world, Zuckerberg wrote. We removed these statements yesterday because we judged that their effect -- and likely their intent -- would be to provoke further violence.\\n\\nZuckerberg added that the priority for the whole country must now be to ensure that the remaining 13 days and the days after inauguration pass peacefully and in accordance with established democratic norms.\\n\\nOver the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies, he continued. We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech.\\n\\nTRUMP SAYS ELECTION WAS 'STOLEN' AND 'THESE ARE THE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT HAPPEN,' TELLS PEOPLE TO 'GO HOME'\\n\\nHe added: But the current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.\\n\\nFacebook first flagged the video, and then removed it altogether, before locking the president's account due to two policy violations. Trump lost the ability to post on Facebook during the feature block.\\n\\nIn the president's video, addressing supporters, he said: I know your pain, I know your hurt.\\n\\nWe had an election that was stolen from us, Trump said in the video taped from the White House. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.\\n\\nHe added: But you have to go home now. We have to have peace, we have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anyone hurt.\\n\\nThe president went on to say that it is a very tough period of time — there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us — from me, from you, from our country.\\n\\nThis was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people, Trump said. We have to have peace.\\n\\nTrump added: So go home, we love you, you're very special, you've seen what happens, you've seen the way others are treated that are so bad, so evil. I know how you feel.\\n\\nBut go home and go home in peace, he said.\\n\\nFacebook Vice President Guy Rosen, upon the platform's removal of the video, initially said: This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.\\n\\nTRUMP TO REGAIN FACEBOOK ACCESS THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER ACCOUNT LOCKED OVER RESPONSE TO CAPITOL VIOLENCE\\n\\nFacebook initially flagged Trump's post with a label saying: Joe Biden has been elected President with results that were certified by all 50 states. The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election. The company later removed the post altogether.\\n\\nTwitter also removed the video, and locked the president's account, but went a step further, warning him that further violations of their rules would result in a permanent suspension from the platform.\\n\\nAnd Instagram also locked the president's account Wednesday night, according to a Twitter message from Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, before the unrest at the Capitol began, the president addressed his supporters at a pro-Trump rally and railed against Big Tech and social media.\\n\\nTwitter's bad news, Trump said. They're all bad news. If you want to go through social media, Big Tech, if you're a Republican or have a big voice, they shadow ban you.\\n\\nHe added: And it should be illegal.\\n\\nThe president also said he has been telling these Republicans to get rid of Section 230.\\n\\nRepublicans have questioned whether social media giants should still be afforded liability protections under Section 230—a rule that shields social media companies from being held liable for content on their platforms, while allowing them to moderate that content."}

{"original": "John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, said on Monday that he was willing to testify at President Trump's impeachment trial if subpoenaed. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify, Mr. Bolton said in a statement on his website.\\n\\nGuy Benson got reaction on this significant development from Senator John Cornyn (R-TX).\\n\\nListen Below:\\n\\nFull Transcript:\\n\\nGuy Benson: We begin the program with U.S. Senator John Cornyn, a Republican of Texas, who joins me now. Senator, great to have you back.\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Thanks, guy. Happy New Year.\\n\\nGuy Benson: Happy New Year to you. Let's start with impeachment. I want to get to Iran as well. But there was a significant development today. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who we know, of course, around here at Fox, pretty well put out a statement saying that after weighing all of the issues, he has, quote, concluded that if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify. He is one of those witnesses that we've heard Democrats talking about. The House didn't bother to subpoena him. But I think there could be some merit to hearing what he has to say. What are your thoughts on that development involving John Bolton? Should he testify?\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I think it's entirely likely that his testimony would be helpful to the president, because it would identify basically a foreign policy dispute which is reserved to the president under the Constitution, is really his sole authority as a as a basis for impeachment for this. Now, the third time in American history. So he could. It could well be beneficial. And as to the second count, which is obstruction, you'll recall that the Adam Schiff did say he was wanted to subpoena Ambassador Bolton. But when Ambassador Bolton said he wanted a court to instruct him whether to comply with the subpoena or whether to invoke executive privilege, as the White House had insisted that he'd look to the court for guidance and Adam Schiff dropped it like a hot potato. So I don't know how this would come out the way I read the ambassador's offer. He didn't say what he was testimony would be, but he would respond to the subpoena. And I would expect anyone who was subpoenaed by the vote of 51 senators to respond. But what their testimony actually turns out to be, that's another matter.\\n\\nGuy Benson: Would you vote in favor of hearing from John Bolton if there was a vote on that subpoena, whether it's, let's say, in your one of your committees, the Judiciary Committee of Chairman Graham decided, OK, let's do it under our auspices or whether it was the full Senate. Do you personally support hearing from John Bolton in this process?\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I would want to know what he has to offer that would help illuminate the issues. The two articles of impeachment that have been issued by the House of Representatives, that would be that would define the scope of any Senate trial. But I think it really is a is an admission by the House, in essence, that in the Senate Democrats that they believe that the basis the 17 witnesses who did testify in the House and the record that they develop there are really inadequate in order to make their case in the Senate. So they're looking for anything and everything, including additional witnesses, in order to bolster that case in the Senate, because they know what they've got so far isn't really sufficient to get the job done.\\n\\nGuy Benson: Senator, I have to say, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, is frequently touted as a master tactician. I think sometimes that reputation has been earned. But I am still flabbergasted that they passed these articles of impeachment, rushed to do it before Christmas, and time was of the essence. It was very urgent for the well-being of our very republic that they do it as soon as possible, which is why they raced through everything and then shoved it in a drawer. Both articles in a drawer and it's been sitting there collecting dust now for weeks. It is 2020. Are you surprised that this continues to be the status quo? What exactly are they doing?\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I'm I am a little surprised because I agree with you. I think ordinarily Speaker Pelosi is a pretty shrewd political tactician. But I think here she got forced to do something she did not want to do in the first place, which was to proceed with the impeachment. You may recall her comments back in March of 2019, where she said only if it was bipartisan and the case compelling would it be worn. The divisiveness that would necessarily arise out of an impeachment proceeding. And then she proceeded after that. Months after that to basically cave in to the demands of the most radical members of her own party. I think that's what happened here. And now she's finds herself in a a bit of a box canyon. And it's not clear exactly how she gets out of this unless, of course, Senator McConnell succumbs, which I know he will not do to the entreaties of Senator Schumer to recreate the circus like atmosphere in the House, in the Senate. We're not going to do that. We will take it seriously. We will perform our constitutional responsibilities. But I think this is a box that. Speaker Pelosi has gotten herself in, and it's going to be fascinating to see how she gets out of it.\\n\\nGuy Benson: Do you have any sense of when this trial might happen because they have to send them over at some point, you would think, except the media keeps talking about an impasse or a standoff. The standoff is totally created by one sidedness, by not just passing along the articles like the last House of Representatives to impeach a president. Did I just. It seems I'm mystified.\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Yeah, well, you would think that that Senate Democrats who negotiated a procedural arrangement for the President Clinton impeachment, that they would be satisfied with that same arrangement being used in the impeachment trial of President Trump. But they're not. And they're asking for more. As we've discussed and I think they know how this ends, because it's going to take 67 votes to convict and remove President Trump. And they're doing all of this less than a year, about 11 months until the next general election. I think it's it's really backfiring on them. They know it is. And they're they're desperate to try to find a way out. But so far, they haven't figured it out.\\n\\nGuy Benson: Last question on this subject. Senator Schumer and a few of his colleagues have gone out there and said that Republicans in the Senate, including Senator McConnell, Leader McConnell, are not impartial jurors. They can't be impartial. They're coordinating with the White House. And there have been calls for recusal, are saying that they're really not fulfilling their constitutional duty in this process. What's your response when you hear that critique?\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I I I wonder whether Senator Schumer thinks that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden I guess he is no longer in the Senate. Amy Klobuchar and other senators running for president are, strictly speaking, impartial writers. It's not a good it's not a good analogy. I know all of us, including myself, have used that as an analogy, but it's not the same thing as an impartial jury in a criminal or civil case that would be tried in a court of law. We know that the that this is primarily a political matter and one where the people who cast their vote, either in the House from the Senate will be held accountable by the people they represent. That's what this is. So I think it's it's hypocritical, particularly if looking back on the way that Senator Schumer and others conducted themselves in the Clinton impeachment, he actually ran for the Senate against Senator Al D'Amato, saying if elected, he would vote to acquit President Clinton. That's not exactly impartial.\\n\\nGuy Benson: No, it's the opposite. Right. Is. It was pledging to be partial. Right. So. Exactly. It's a it's a rich it's a rich line of criticism from him. Given his past that you've just outlined there, Senator, let's move to Iran and the strike on Soleimani, the Iranian general and terrorist mastermind. Your reaction? We've had the weekend to think about it. I know D.C. is buzzing and people are fighting about it. Your assessment?\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Well, the world is a better place for for this. And certainly while we don't know what Iran's response is going to be, I think President Trump acted within his authority to defend the United States, our troops and our interests in the Middle East against somebody who has American blood on his hands and who's been known to be part of a designated terrorist organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and particularly the Kurds force that has is well-known throughout the Middle East, providing things like explosively formed penetrators, which would cut through the armor of American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq like a knife through a hot knife, through butter. So nobody should mourn the demise of general Soleimani And the president did operate within his constitutional authority. I think what we've just been discussing and the disarray of the House over this impeachment matter shows the wisdom of the founding fathers giving these sort of decisions under the Constitution to the commander in chief and not 535 members of Congress. I think the contrast between the way that the death of Osama bin Laden was greeted on a bipartisan basis in the way now that Soleimani death is being greeted on a partisan basis, is tells tells the story.\\n\\nGuy Benson: I have seen some television interviews where prominent Democrats, for example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former DNC chairwoman, she's a member of Congress from Florida. Also, Elizabeth Warren, one of your colleagues in the Senate who's running for president. They have suggested that President Trump Green led the attack against Soleimani as a means of distraction from impeachment. What do you make of an allegation like that?\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I think it's irresponsible and I think it defies reality. I mean, the truth is it's the Democrats who are trying to change the subject and trying to create a further circus like atmosphere here in the Senate because of their lack of success in dealing with this impeachment matter in the House. This is obviously a totally separate matter. I respect people what Democrats like Joe Lieberman and Jay Johnson, who both said in recent days that this is well within the president's authority and a necessary act. And I also respect great leaders like Ryan Crocker, who today I think is in The New York Times, wrote a piece about why this was within the president's authority, why it was necessary. And it was a former CIA director and CENTCOM commander, David Petraeus, who made the point that this is more significant in terms of our fight against radical Islam than was the death of Osama bin Laden. So this was a a very big deal. And I think the president is to be commended for his decisive action in the face of a real threat.\\n\\nGuy Benson: Last question. It deals with that last point that you made, the real threat. There are some people questioning the intelligence about imminent attacks or what Soleimani was up to. I know there are briefings scheduled for some of your colleagues on Capitol Hill later on in the week. Based on what you've seen, what you've heard, what is your understanding of the solid ness of that intelligence?\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I have read the the war powers notification that the president sent over here. I think he has to do it within 48 hours of of the of the strike. And he did. I think we all know generally what the role of Iran has been. The national sponsor, international sponsor of international terrorism, who the sponsoring force, pro-Hezbollah, Hamas and other radical groups. I just think that the the idea that this was not a threat, then that's who Soleimani was somehow an innocent and didn't deserve. What he got is just flies in the face of the reality that we all that we all understand and know. But we will be further briefings. I just wonder whether the facts will matter to our friends who've already made up their mind. Anything President Trump does, they're against reflexively.\\n\\nGuy Benson: Yes. Those very same impartial jurists. Right. Same the same folks,in some of those cases. A lot going on. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, we so appreciate your time on this Monday. Thank you.\\n\\nSen. Cornyn: Thank you, guy.\\n\\nGuy Benson: We are just kicking off the program and the week it's the Guy Benson's show. Stay with me."}
{"original": "San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin is under fire this week after a parolee on New Year's Eve allegedly ran through a red light in a stolen car, killing two pedestrians.\\n\\nChesa Boudin became San Francisco's top prosecutor a year ago as part of a politically progressive wave of prosecutors committed to seeking restorative justice over mass incarceration.\\n\\nNow, the former deputy public defender and son of members of one-time Weather Underground members is facing criticism after the deaths of the two pedestrians, fueling criticism in a city plagued by rampant drug dealing and a surge in break-ins.\\n\\nPolice say Troy McAlister, 45, was intoxicated when he ran a red light in a stolen car, killing Elizabeth Platt, 60, and Hanako Abe, 27. The San Francisco police officers union says a plea agreement for a robbery set McAlister free on parole in April, and that Boudin's office failed to prosecute McAlister's multiple arrests in the aftermath, including one Dec. 20 for alleged car theft.\\n\\nA California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman told The Associated Press that McAlister has been incarcerated in state prisons numerous times. In April 2020, he was sentenced in San Francisco County to five years for second-degree robbery and was released on parole for time served.\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO'S NEW DA PLEDGES NOT TO PROSECUTE PUBLIC URINATION, OTHER QUALITY-OF-LIFE CRIMES\\n\\nBoudin has defended his office's choices, saying that charging McAlister with a new, nonviolent crime would not have necessarily put the serial offender behind bars. He instead blamed law enforcement agencies, saying they could also have acted differently to avoid a terrible and devastating tragedy but vowed to make concrete changes in his office.\\n\\nThe San Francisco Police Officers' Association, which opposed Boudin's candidacy for district attorney, is seeking an independent panel to review charging decisions, saying there may be conflicts of interest involving Boudin's old employer, the public defender's office.\\n\\nTwo people were killed on New Year's Eve because Chesa Boudin refused to do his job, which is to hold criminals and victimizers accountable, said union president Tony Montoya, who excoriated him for trying to blame other agencies.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, McAlister pleaded not guilty to all charges, including vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, possession of a firearm and leaving the scene of a collision, and will stay in jail. Boudin's office, which has a policy of not seeking cash bail, sought detention, spokeswoman Rachel Marshall said.\\n\\nSan Francisco's public defender, Mano Raju, whose office is representing McAlister, rejected calls to revive what he called failed tough on crime rhetoric.\\n\\nWe cannot let opponents of a more fair and just criminal legal system exploit this loss-of-life to convince others that the system we've long relied upon is the best we can do, he said.\\n\\nDAS BACKED BY SOROS, OTHER LIBERAL ACTIVISTS JOIN FRAY IN CLASH WITH POLICE\\n\\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday that the district attorney's office, under Boudin's leadership, dismissed previous criminal strikes against McAlister and agreed to the five years he had already served for a 2015 robbery. Marshall said the district attorney's office reviewed the case carefully, including substantial mitigation presented.\\n\\nBoudin, 40, was elected to the district attorney's office in 2019 having never prosecuted a case and never run for elected office.\\n\\nSupporters of police reform celebrated his win as part of a broader movement to end harsh incarceration sentences in favor of more meaningful remedies that address poverty, systemic racism and addiction. But that hasn't eased fears of people who say that San Francisco is too lax on repeat offenders.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBoudin, meanwhile, has blamed the San Francisco police union, its president, and individual officers for spreading what he called lies and misinformation. His office has received the same number of burglary cases from police for possible prosecution, despite burglaries increasing nearly 50% between 2019 and 2020, he said.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}

{"original": "What a week for politics. Usama bin Laden is dead. Even the president's boldest Republican critics – read that as former Vice President Cheney – have expressed admiration for the Obama administration's ability to locate and kill America's number one enemy.\\n\\nBut the 2012 presidential campaign is already underway with a field of Republican candidates taking shape. And that is where your faithful Fox News political analyst needs your help. I want you to send me questions for the candidates who will be on stage for the first debate of the GOP primary season.\\n\\nThe debate will be on the Fox News Channel this Thursday night, May 5 at 9 p.m. E.T.\\n\\nI, along with my colleagues Bret Bair, Chris Wallace and Shannon Bream, will be quizzing the GOP candidates on a wide range of foreign and domestic policy issues. As the first round in the fight for the nomination this meeting will set the tone for the rest of the campaign. The primary field is having a hard time taking shape despite the fact that 80 percent of Republicans disapprove of President Obama's performance in office.\\n\\nSo, I am asking for you to come up with the sharpest questions. Please send them to: foxforum@foxnews.com.\\n\\nAs you think about those questions, as a public service from your Fox News political analyst, here is all you need to know – your official scorecard.\\n\\nNumber one, don't be fooled by the line-up. All the players will not be on the field Thursday. First here's a list of the candidates who will be suiting up and appearing on the field: Tim Pawlenty, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain and Gary Johnson.\\n\\nOne unique aspect of this debate is that for millions of Americans, even the most ardent Republicans, it will be the first time they have seen or heard these candidates.\\n\\nPawlenty will be the most plausible candidate for the nomination on stage Thrusday night. The former Minnesota governor's calm and reasoned demeanor will set him apart from the far-right firebrands who will be on stage. His biggest challenge will be to resist the temptation to be pulled too far to the right.\\n\\nSantorum, Paul and Cain will undoubtedly be throwing rhetorical red meat to the South Carolina audience. Pawlenty has never shown the ability to compete with any of them as a performer and a showman. His strength is a good record of conservative policies from his tenure as governor of Minnesota. If he simply gives direct answers to the questions and does not get drawn into the contest for who can be the most outrageous conservative provocateur, it might be enough to make him a winner.\\n\\nFor the other four candidates on the stage the big debate is their best chance so far to make a winning impression on GOP voters. One of them could have a very big night and become the leader of the pack.\\n\\nGOP primary voters tend to be more conservative just as Democratic primary voters tend to be more liberal. Rick Santorum, Herman Cain, Ron Paul, Gary Johnson and Buddy Roemer are generally far to the right and wildcards. Their unabashed rhetoric might spark an Internet sensation and appeal to the voters who are want a GOP nominee who is the antithesis of politics as usual.\\n\\nBut will the lesser-known candidates know how to handle foreign policy questions? Can they demonstrate knowledge of economic issues? Send in those questions.\\n\\nNow, here's a list of candidates who will not be appearing on Thursday night: Michelle Bachmann, Mitch Daniels, Newt Gingrich, Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin all will not be attending. Bachmann, Gingrich and Romney have been clear about their interest in pursuing the nomination. Daniels, Huckabee, Palin and Trump have been clearly hesitant to officially jump into the fray.\\n\\nIt's my belief that Romney, the biggest star in the group, is not coming because he wants the Republican faithful, especially people with big money, to come to him out of frustration with a mediocre field and give him the nomination by acclamation.\\n\\nBut he knows that if he shows up he'll be targeted by all the other candidates who want to bring down the biggest player. And he will have to endure question after question from the Fox team and his opponents about creating a universal health care plan in Massachusetts that closely mirrors the president's controversial health care reform plan. So his strategy is to let the little guys fight it out before they get to challenge him.\\n\\nIf Gingrich showed up he will have to answer questions from all sides about his flip-flops on U.S. intervention in Libya.\\n\\nDaniels knows he'd be pressed to explain why ending funding for Planned Parenthood in Indiana last week was not just a crass effort to make up with social conservatives after saying that social issues should not be the focus of this year's Republican primary.\\n\\nAnd Bachmann is worried about being buried under demands for her to explain incorrect statements such as the claim that the federal government controls more than half of the American economy and the American Revolution started in New Hampshire.\\n\\nAnd of course, Donald Trump would have to answer uncomfortable questions about having pursued the birther question to the detriment of the Republican Party.\\n\\nIn 2008, by the time of the first primary debate, all of the major candidates had declared their intentions and showed up for the first debate. John McCain, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Huckabee went into the debate with their campaigns in full swing. Even the lesser-known candidates -- Ron Paul, Duncan Hunter, Tom Tancredo, Tommy Thompson, and Jim Gilmore – had made several trips to the early primary states and were in campaign mode. Only former Senator Fred Thompson waited several months to get into the race and found himself unable to catch up to the other candidates.\\n\\nThe 2012 season is off to a late start but it will be a spirited one. The other potential candidates will be watching. With the death of Usama Bin Laden, one wonders if any of the Republican candidates will be less enthusiastic about the getting the opportunity to take on the commander-in-chief this time around.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts? Put on your thinking caps and let me see those questions!\\n\\nJuan Williams is a writer, author and Fox News political analyst. His most recent book is Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America--and What We Can Do About It. Watch Juan and his Fox News colleagues Chris Wallace and Shannon Bream at the first GOP debate of the 2012 campaign on Fox News Channel, Thursday, May 5 at 9 p.m. ET."}
{"original": "This is a rush transcript from Tucker Carlson Tonight, January 2, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nTUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.\\n\\nLast weekend, as you saw Grafton Thomas carry out a horrifying stabbing attack at a Hanukkah party in Monsey, New York. Listen to the daughter of one victim described the aftermath of that.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has a fractured skull. He has been sliced, like through his neck. He has a shattered arm. The doctors do not have high hopes for him. He may never be -- I mean, if he wakes up, he may never be able to walk, talk or even process speech again.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Awful. So far the coverage of the attack in Monsey has focused on the rising number of violent anti-Jewish incidents in New York and across the country, as well as on Thomas's own psychiatric issues which were significant.\\n\\nBut we must be honest and tell you there was another factor at play and that was ideology. Thomas was only on the street in the first place because politicians long ago decided to side with criminals over normal people in New York.\\n\\nBy the time he began stabbing strangers in the synagogue, Thomas had already been arrested seven times, in some cases for violent offenses like assault, resisting arrest and killing a police animal.\\n\\nNow, despite all of that, the only jail time Thomas ever received was in 2013 on a drug offense, somehow he was able to kill a police animal and never go to jail.\\n\\nIn other words, Grafton Thomas gave us plenty of warning. The people in charge of protecting us just decided to ignore those warnings.\\n\\nBernard Kerik was once the New York City Police Commissioner and he joins us tonight. Bernie, thanks so much for coming on. How did this happen?\\n\\nBERNARD KERIK, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well listen, I've been, you know, talking about this for the last year where I think the city, the State of New York is irresponsible in creating these laws where they're not holding people accountable.\\n\\nOn January 1st, just two days ago, you know, we signed into law and it's gone into effect where people that burglarize, that Rape 3 -- Rape third class, and a number of different crimes, violent crimes are now being considered not violent. And people aren't held when they get locked up.\\n\\nThey're just turning them around right through a turnstile. I think it's -\\n\\n- this is a demonstration of how the city is going to implode if they don't fix it and fix it fast because you're going to continue to have people like this out on the streets.\\n\\nCARLSON: Most of what you're saying is intuitive. It's obvious. Normal people, I think, know it instinctively. So why the change? Was there a groundswell of support for letting people out of prison or not putting them in prison for killing police animals, for example, or rape? I mean, how did we get here?\\n\\nKERIK: Well, I think it's this left wing liberal socialist push, where we villainize the police. We embolden the criminals. We let people out. You know, there was the criminal justice reform push.\\n\\nYou know, here's the bottom line. There should be criminal justice reform.\\n\\nBbad people that do bad things belong in prison.\\n\\nWe put Rod Blagojevich, the Governor of Illinois in prison for 14 years for talking about politics on the phone.\\n\\nCARLSON: I agree.\\n\\nKERIK: But you have people committing getting violent acts, violent acts against others, and they turn around and let them out to go out and do it again the next day, and the next day after.\\n\\nYou've had -- you had a woman who committed three acts of violence in three days, and she's been let out every day after.\\n\\nCARLSON: So you started on the New York City force, at the Police Department when New York was dangerous. You took over running the department when it had become safer, it was still safer after you left and now you're seeing it move in the opposite direction. It almost seems like we know what to do to make the city safe, but we're not doing it on purpose.\\n\\nKERIK: You know what, Tucker? Nobody knows how to fix the city and how to reduce crime better than I did, and I do because I was there when the Renaissance occurred, but it looks like this Mayor and this Governor, they're trying to diminish and destroy all the programs that were put in place that reduced crime by 65 -- violent crime by 65 to 70 percent, homicide by 70 to 75 percent.\\n\\nAnd what they did in this -- with these new laws where they're letting people back out on the street, it's going to diminish quality of life and it's going to enhance violence.\\n\\nCARLSON: It just shows you what political leaders can do the damage they can wreak. I mean, all of our attention is on the national stage. But here you have just a Mayor, just as Mayor of a city, causing remarkable damage to people.\\n\\nKERIK: Well, listen, all you have to do is look what's happened in the last week, in the last 24 hours. This thing should be reversed. The Mayor should be screaming out of his mind to get it reversed.\\n\\nHe's not out there. He's not doing it. It endangers the public. It's irresponsible. It's dangerous to the police officers to put their lives on the line on a daily basis to go out and arrest people. It's a shame.\\n\\nCARLSON: It's depressing. Bernie Kerik, thanks so much for that.\\n\\nAs you just heard, New York City appears to be doing everything that it can to create more Grafton Thomas's. A New Year's Day new bail laws went into effect in New York State. Those aren't going to help.\\n\\nPretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included. What does it mean? It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes.\\n\\nIn the words of Governor Andrew Cuomo himself, the guy behind this, 90 percent of criminal defendants will now be back on the street right after being arrested.\\n\\nHabitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught. With no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend.\\n\\nWho benefits from this? It's hard to see who benefits from it, except the people getting out of jail.\\n\\nLast week, New York resident Tiffany Harris allegedly assaulted three Orthodox Jewish women in Brooklyn. Harris was arrested, charged and released. On Sunday she was arrested and charged with another assault and she was released again.\\n\\nOn New Year's Eve, guess what she did? She got arrested for a third time.\\n\\nThis time she is finally being kept in custody. That's New York.\\n\\nBut Democratic presidential candidates have made it clear that if they take power in Washington this fall, they will make the rest of the country every bit as inviting for criminals. Watch this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I have been a leader in the United States Senate on saying we need to get rid of the cash bail system.\\n\\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're in jail because they are too poor to afford cash bail. You understand what I'm saying? We're going to end cash bail.\\n\\nSEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: We should get rid of cash bail entirely.\\n\\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How about we stop making poverty a crime? No more cash bail. This is crazy.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Is this what the country wants or needs? Is this a peaceful place where law-abiding citizens feel safe and protected and ought to be, increasingly it's not.\\n\\nFor about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class. Eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging. They're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, over policed neighborhoods, whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more.\\n\\nNow, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden Republicans who have forgotten who they represent. The year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies.\\n\\nWe have the numbers. Here's what they are. In Philadelphia, a city we've taken a close look at in the show under the direction of Soros funded DA, Larry Krasner, the city recorded 359 murders for the year. That's the most in more than a decade.\\n\\nIn other words, people died as a result of these policies, more than a hundred and it's not just in Philadelphia. Baltimore had 348 murders last year. That's the most since 1993 and at a per capita level, it's the deadliest year on record in Baltimore.\\n\\nIn 2014, Dallas had only 116 homicides this year after the far left, John Creuzot promise not to prosecute thefts valued at less than 750 bucks. The murder rate went up to over 200.\\n\\nIn Charlotte, North Carolina, 57 homicides recorded last year -- 57. This year, Charlotte reached that number before the end of June and then just kept going. The city finished with 108 murders on the year. That's the most since the early 1990s.\\n\\nHow about Washington, the nation's capital? Well in 2012, D.C. had just 88 murders. Even two years ago, there were only 116, but this year, 2019, 166 murders. See a trend? You should because it's everywhere.\\n\\nWe could spend half the show resetting the stats for city after city -- St. Louis, Raleigh, Seattle, Louisville, Cincinnati -- we could go on and on.\\n\\nThe point is across the country, in city after city, murder rates have surged dramatically compared with just five years ago. This is happening.\\n\\nThese are not fake statistics. They're the most real.\\n\\nAnd even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe.\\n\\nSan Francisco, for example, facing an epidemic of shoplifting and car robberies, it has made life unbearable for many taxpayers. We've got a series on that running next week, which you won't want to miss.\\n\\nThe bottom line is, normal people don't want criminal justice reform. They want criminal justice enforcement. They've always wanted that. So why aren't they getting it?\\n\\nHeather Mac Donald has thought a lot about this question. She is the author of the book, The Diversity Delusion, a frequent guest on the show, and she joins us tonight. Heather, thanks so much for coming on.\\n\\nHEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: So I don't think there is any topic on which there is a greater divide between what the majority of citizens of all parties, all colors say they want and what they get from the people in charge. Why is this complicated for our leaders?\\n\\nMAC DONALD: Because they're in the grips of a false narrative, which says that the criminal justice system is racist. This massive wave of de- incarceration, decriminalization that is going on across the country as you point out, Tucker, is being done in the name of racial justice.\\n\\nWell, guess who those homicide victims are overwhelmingly? Black.\\n\\nCARLSON: Exactly.\\n\\nMAC DONALD: Law-abiding blacks. The criminal justice system, Tucker, is not racist. The incidence of people in prison is because of crime, not their skin color.\\n\\nPrison today remains a Lifetime Achievement Award for persistence in criminal offending. You have to work very hard to get yourself sentenced to prison, and yet, the elites are convinced and they're trying to persuade the rest of the world that America's endemic racism is willy-nilly throwing black people in prison and throwing away the keys. That is simply not the case.\\n\\nCARLSON: I can't resist pointing out that at the very moment when we're literally letting arsonists go free, Roger Stone is facing life in prison for what? It's not even clear.\\n\\nSo the political penalties have gotten stiffer, but the penalties for violence and mayhem have almost disappeared in a lot of cases. But again, there's no constituency for this outside of like small pockets of affluence on the coast, like normal people are not for this. They never have been for it. So how do our leaders get away with it?\\n\\nMAC DONALD: Well, the activists are for it, the academia is for it. Again, the universities are the source of this narrative that says that everything about America today is defined and created by racism. And I guess, the public does not have a voice.\\n\\nBut we if we get a rise in crime, like we did in the 90s, it is going to swing back again. Right now, we are living off of the law enforcement reforms that said policing matters, that incarceration matters, and we've gotten lazy, and the elites are back in the saddle, you know, and it's going to take a lot of thousands of more black lives lost to criminals who should be in jail before this gets turned around.\\n\\nCARLSON: Let me ask a quick question. So when Bernie Sanders or someone like him stands up and says, the only reason these people are in jail is because they're poor, just like demonstrably false.\\n\\nI've never heard a Republican candidate or any Republican officeholders say, you know, that's just a flat out lie actually. We have the numbers, you're wrong. Why do they never stand up for simple law and order?\\n\\nMAC DONALD: They're scared. I mean, they're absolutely terrified of the racism charge. I was at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that talked about the criminal justice system. I was very disappointed in the Republicans. They just spouted bromides about our men and women in blue without actually combating the lie that the criminal justice system is racist.\\n\\nAs for this idea that cash bail affects the poor. Listen, in New York City, only seven percent of misdemeanor arrestees have any kind of bail set for them. And that's because they have long felony arrest records and only\\n\\n0.6 percent of misdemeanor arrests, these are actually in jail.\\n\\nIn fact, most people are put on the streets anyway. And so this bail reform law is a solution in search of a non-problem that is only going to create more crime.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, exactly. There you go with your statistics and those spooky numbers. We appreciate it though. Heather Mac Donald, thank you so much.\\n\\nMAC DONALD: Thank you, Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: Another Democrat dropped out of the presidential race, and once again, the press is distressed by this. They are calling Democratic primary voters bigots for not supporting him, are they?\\n\\nPlus, Joe Biden says putting coal miners out of work is no big deal. They should just learn to code. Can they? That's next. Amazing.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: There's an awful lot of news tonight, but we want to pause and acknowledge something that's happened in the Democratic presidential race. Julian Castro is out.\\n\\nIn other words, until this morning, he was still running for President. You'd be forgiven if you assume that he dropped out months ago. That's how effective his candidacy was.\\n\\nThe only time he got any attention was at the first Democratic debate, you might remember. It was back in June, where he addressed the pressing problem, one of the biggest problems this country faces, how do biological men get abortions? He had an answer.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJULIAN CASTRO, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. You know, what that means is that just because a woman or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female who is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So there was that and he won a vote or two with that unusual argument. His other argument was that voters should vote for him based on his identity. The video announcing the end of his candidacy opened and closed with a line in Spanish, which basically said it all, vote for me because of my background and because I speak Spanish.\\n\\nThe irony, though, is that Julian Castro actually can't speak Spanish. He is just totally fraudulent. Now, there's nothing wrong with not being able to speak Spanish. Actually, that's not a crime.\\n\\nIn fact, if anything, Castro could have celebrated that is proof that immigrants assimilate into American study as they have for hundreds of years. That's a good thing. We used to be for that.\\n\\nBut the vision of actual assimilation has no currency in the modern Democratic Party, where people are constantly divided up by skin color, nationality, gender and language.\\n\\nSo instead, he had to play up his views on immigration, which honestly, were kind of extreme. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCASTRO: Instead of building a wall or closing the border, we should choose compassion instead of cruelty.\\n\\nALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: The feeling from this administration is that we are in a full-blown crisis and that they are overwhelmed by it. How do you think?\\n\\nCASTRO: You know, I don't believe their narrative. I don't believe the BS.\\n\\nWe should decriminalize people who are coming here, crossing the border.\\n\\nWe need to increase the number of refugees that we take into this country.\\n\\nAnd if we're not careful, if we don't get this right, in 20 or 30 years, this nation is going to be begging for immigrants to come to this country.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Begging -- and if you're not, you're not grateful. You're a bad person.\\n\\nWell, as we said, he is out of the race and over on MSNBC, they're taking it hard. Some of the anchors pointed to Castro's departure. It's just the latest evidence that the Democratic primary electorate is racist.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Julian Castro, the only thing Latino running ends his campaign today leaving the Democrats even less diverse. Following the earlier departure, of course of Senator Kamala Harris.\\n\\nAs of now, there are going to be five white candidates on this next debate stage. Is that sustainable for the Democratic Party?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: David Perino is the first person we go to, to figure out what's going on in this race. She hosts The Daily Briefing, of course with Dana Perino. We're always grateful to have her.\\n\\nSo Dana, you keep hearing from Democrats, this grave disappointment in their own primary electorate suggesting that they're bigots for supporting, I guess, Biden and Bernie, what do you make of that?\\n\\nDANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: And then I wonder if the media organizations are going to send out a bunch of reporters all across the nation to find out what actually is happening in this country as they did after the 2016 election results.\\n\\nAnd the thing about Julio Castro is that he gave the D.N.C. Convention speech back in 2012 and he became the candidate of tomorrow, but he was a candidate of tomorrow for so long that it became yesterday.\\n\\nHe never was able to get a foothold. And the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized.\\n\\nIf you think of someone like Elizabeth Warren and Medicare-for-All, that got the full treatment, but Julian Castro, ever since 2012 thought that he was going to be on that stage, maybe the nominee? I think that he will, though, be on the VP shortlist, even if he really doesn't deserve to be, but his name will be on the list.\\n\\nBut I don't know if they'll actually choose him because there's many other people that show that they were able to get some base of support.\\n\\nCARLSON: You make such a smart point. I mean, if I get up and said, you know, if a biological man gets pregnant, I promise I'll pay for his abortion. I'd be laughed at and I'd probably lose my job, right?\\n\\nBut he was so ignored that he could say that and people were like, oh, yeah, okay. You know, whatever. I just want to ask you --\\n\\nPERINO: That's when you know you're in real trouble. If you say something like that and like -- it's like if a tree falls in a forest, like if you say something like that on a debate stage and everyone goes, yes, well, it's just like helium. Okay.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes, you could just be floridly and say that and nobody cares.\\n\\nSo this happened in New Hampshire on Monday. Joe Biden explained how coal miners should adapt to having their jobs regulated out of existence. They should just learn a completely different profession from scratch. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I come from a family -- we're in an area where there is coal mining in Scranton. Anybody who could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mine sure in hell can learn how to program as well.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So this just -- this struck me as so very similar to a line that we heard not very long ago, basically dismissing the concerns of people whose industries, particularly the coal business has been regulated out of existence. Is that a wise thing even for a Democrats to say right now?\\n\\nPERINO: So you're saying I think you're talking about the Hillary Clinton comment in the 2016 campaign.\\n\\nCARLSON: I am. That's right.\\n\\nPERINO: In which basically she was like celebrating the fact that they were going to try to put coal out of business, and then she had the deplorables line and she never really came back from that.\\n\\nI think the thing about Joe Biden is that a lot of people will give him the benefit of the doubt and they will think, well, Joe means well. Okay, like, he doesn't really -- he doesn't want us to be without jobs. He cares about us -- like, he has that.\\n\\nBut there is an elitist attitude about coal that it belies the entire Democratic Party. The truth is, if he wants to win, he is going to have to try to win back some of those workers ion the rust belt, including coal workers.\\n\\nCARLSON: Right.\\n\\nPERINO: And I think that what he could have done, since apparently America is in a mood to wildly spend on government programs, why not try to ratchet it up and I would -- he could have said something like, I'm going to commit\\n\\n$15 billion for this community, specifically to help them, make sure that they're taken care of et cetera.\\n\\nNow, one thing that happened last week, the taxpayers are going to bail out a lot of the coal pensions because they were mismanaged by the executives, not the workers, but by the executives and guess then who gets on the hook for that? The taxpayers.\\n\\nAnd Joe Biden doesn't do any of that. He bypasses it and says something they could learn to code, which I think will come back to haunt him.\\n\\nCARLSON: So I just wonder quickly, I mean, that kind of tells you a lot about how that community is viewed in the Democratic Party. I mean, is it that hard if you're promising, you know, everybody a chunk of cash, just to say that, you know, Kentucky, Southwest Virginia and West Virginia, here's some -- but they can't because they don't like those people.\\n\\nPERINO: I think that it's showing that you have some -- I mean, think about Bill Clinton, right? I feel your pain. He didn't really, right?\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes.\\n\\nPERINO: But people thought that he meant it when he said that. Joe Biden has the capability to be that kind of guy as well. But what he said the other night was much more in line with sort of the fundraising circuit for Democrats, not the people circuit.\\n\\nCARLSON: Yes. Mistake. Dana Perino, great to see you tonight. Thank you.\\n\\nPERINO: Okay. Happy New Year.\\n\\nCARLSON: Happy New Year. So you were celebrating this past week with your family, but permanent Washington was plotting yet another war in the Middle East.\\n\\nTonight, there seems to have been another big step toward that war. We will be asking a question nobody seems to be raising. Is it a good idea?\\n\\nAn update and what's happening tonight after the break.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: We have an unexpected Fox News alert for you, something that has just happened in Iraq. The situation there, heating up very quickly without any debate here in Washington.\\n\\nIraqi television has just confirmed that Qasem Soleimani, a former general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Commander of the Quds Force has been killed in a rocket attack apparently initiated by the United States near the Baghdad airport, along with the top official in the Iraqi Shiite militia. Now, what were they doing in Iraq? Unclear.\\n\\nBut his death comes several days after tensions kind of came out into the open in that country. Last week, if you've been following this, you know, an American civilian contractor was killed by militants in Iraq. The U.S.\\n\\ngovernment blamed that attack on Iran and it retaliated with strikes.\\n\\nIn response, protesters blockaded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. It's basically where we were when the show started tonight.\\n\\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now.\\n\\nNow, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war. And we have to say it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades.\\n\\nFor example, disgraced National Security adviser, John Bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with Iran and tonight, Bolton may be finally getting his wish. Should you be happy about that? That's the question.\\n\\nWell, the last time we took John Bolton's advice in the region, Iran became far more powerful than it was before, before we took John Bolton's advice.\\n\\nWhy? Because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in Washington.\\n\\nIn this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the south. The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed.\\n\\nPay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us. The real threat is Iran. Well, they're liars. And they don't care about you. They don't care about your kids. They are reckless and incompetent. And you should keep all of that in mind, as war with Iran looms closer tonight.\\n\\nCurt Mills is a senior writer at the American Conservative. He joins us now. So Curt, this is unfolding, even as we speak. Where could it go from here?\\n\\nCURT MILLS, SENIOR WRITER, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE: Well, like you said, if you liked the Iraq War, Tucker, we're back with a sequel, the Iran War.\\n\\nI would say the deep concern is, look, a general in the Iranian forces being assassinated is not necessarily something to mourn or begrudge the U.S. getting involved in.\\n\\nCARLSON: That's right. I agree.\\n\\nMILLS: The question is, though, is this a Franz Ferdinand moment? Is this a situation where a great power gets involved with the middle tier power and gets the world into a world war?\\n\\nIran, I think is a problem for the U.S. and its allies in the region. But it is not an existential threat, like China or Russia. China or Russia, particularly China would love to see another decade or two of Americans my age, dying in the sand for no particular purpose.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, that's exactly it. It's not that anyone I think in the United States has particular affection for Iran or trust in its government, much, much less the Revolutionary Guard or the Kurds forces. Of course not.\\n\\nBut it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face. I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.\\n\\nMILLS: It's a joke. It's a joke. I mean, I think the real question is, why do we still have troops there? So you see the Baghdad embassy protests. And to be clear, this is not just an embassy. This is a fortress. It's been a fortress since we took out Saddam in 2003 and American troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages.\\n\\nThey're just -- they're sent there. So the question the President, who I think rightfully ran in 2016, against the Bush legacy. The question is, does he want to re-invade Iraq?\\n\\nI understand there are people in his Cabinet that are selling him that Iran is not Iraq? But the fact of the matter, Iran is quite similar to Iraq.\\n\\nWe're talking about Iraq, 16 years later, it's still Iraq.\\n\\nIn order to counter Iran, I think the choice is clear. The President should contain Iranian influence in the region. We should avoid a hot war, which we are barreling towards at all costs.\\n\\nCARLSON: So my sense of it is, the President doesn't seek war and he is wary of it, particularly in an election year, but I think he was elected on the promise that he would avoid wars except when absolutely necessary.\\n\\nBut there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of Washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, Bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the President wants.\\n\\nMILLS: Right. So I think the President of the United States' convictions on this matter are sincere, but I think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with.\\n\\nI know, Bolton is a bugbear for you. But in some ways, Bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious. He actually was a bit of a problem for the Iran Hawk Crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like Robert C. O'Brien, Bolton's successor might actually be more effective at Trojan horsing, what I think would be a tragedy in the Middle East.\\n\\nIran is not Iraq, it's twice as big. It'd be twice as bad. We're weaker than we were 16 years ago. If President George W. Bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if Trump does, he is cooked.\\n\\nCARLSON: I think that's right. Curt Mills. Great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.\\n\\nMILLS: Thanks. So you hear a lot from the left about how concerned about the environment they are. But you've noticed that those concerns have always conveniently dovetailed with acquiring more political power and crushing their political enemies.\\n\\nCalifornia saw major wildfires this year and according to the Nation magazine, there's a clear culprit -- private homeownership is the problem.\\n\\nAnd we're quoting now, The idealization of individual homeownership created the scorching landscapes we face today. Individual homeownership should be seriously questioned.\\n\\nBanning private homeownership? Will that stop wildfires? It would fix the environment. How about building fewer shopping malls? No one ever thinks of that. No, it won't. It will make the government more powerful. It'll make regular people less happy and less free. And of course, that is the point.\\n\\nVictor Davis Hanson is a lifelong Californian. He is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and we're happy to have him tonight. Professor, thanks a lot for coming on. Do you think that wildfires besetting your state mean that people should not be allowed to own their own homes?\\n\\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, it's a characteristic of the left that they envision natural and man-made disasters as opportunities to ram down agendas that we otherwise wouldn't vote for, and that's what Rahm Emanuel said, never let a crisis go to waste.\\n\\nI think it was AOC's Chief of Staff who said the New Green Deal was really not about climate change, but changing the American economy along socialist lines. This had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, Tucker.\\n\\nWe've only gone up about one degree in a century in California. That's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed. What it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought.\\n\\nWe never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, PG&E which was at one time as you remember as a Californian, the best utility in the United States. It's ossified. It's calcified. It's over regulated. It's got all these green mandates. It's got to use expensive energy production.\\n\\nIt doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when I was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now.\\n\\nAnd then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA. So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California.\\n\\nAnd when you have infrastructure -- infrastructure that is rated about the worst in the nation, our highways and bridges, and it's hard to get to these places. The freeways are packed. We haven't built a major reservoir since New Melones Dam in 1983. So it's a kind of a perfect storm.\\n\\nAnd you know, Tucker when state and local officials can't solve existential problems, they blame other reasons and when they can't deal with homelessness and then you banned plastic bottles at San Francisco Airport.\\n\\nWe can't deal with utility or wildfire damage, then you say climate change did it and we've got to become socialists.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, I mean, it's dysfunctional because it's crowded, and it's crowded because of their immigration policy and they won't admit that.\\n\\nThey did this, as you know. Professor, thank you so much.\\n\\nHANSON: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: So attacking homeowners is just one facet of the broader assault on normal people in this country. In the City of San Francisco, progressives are working constantly to create their ideal vision of an American city.\\n\\nBut the opposite has been the effect. It is now unsafe, unhealthy, unaffordable, and for many, unlivable. It's a dystopia in a lot of ways.\\n\\nThe most beautiful city in our country.\\n\\nWe sent a team of producers to San Francisco for an in-depth exclusive investigation into what is happening there. And the effect it is having on the dwindling pool of middle class residents.\\n\\nOur special series debuts next Monday, and it continues all week. Here's a short preview of what we found.\\n\\n(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)\\n\\nCARLSON: Oh, it's -- even the trailer is all too much. It's shocking what we found.\\n\\nWell, up next, free speech may be dying in parts of America, but Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager are ensuring the First Amendment would at least go down fighting.\\n\\nTheir documentary is back in theaters and they join us next to talk about it. Stay tuned.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Freedom of speech is America's most distinctive, right. It's a free country. Remember they used to say that back when it was. But it's also the most embattled of all of our rights.\\n\\nIn the name of safety and sensitivity, a coalition of big tech monopolists, universities and political activists are fighting to limit what you're allowed to say, and punish those who stray outside the accepted boundaries.\\n\\nBut last year, comedian Adam Carolla who is a genius, and radio host, Dennis Prager, also kind of genius, teamed up to release No Safe Spaces,\\n\\nkind of a brilliant documentary about the American Anti-Speech Movement.\\n\\nHere's part of it.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDENNIS PRAGER, FOUNDER, PRAGER U: Israel sent me into the Soviet Union when I was 21 years old, because I knew Russian and Hebrew, and I was sent in to smuggle out the names of Jews that I would find in the Soviet Union and to smuggle in religious items and so on.\\n\\nAnd I really experienced what most people in the West have never ever experienced -- life under a totalitarian regime.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: It's a great movie. And if you want to see it in theaters, you still have a chance to do that. The film is having a limited release this weekend, thanks to strong support from grateful viewers.\\n\\nAdam Carolla and Dennis Prager, join us tonight. Gentlemen, thanks both for coming out. I haven't talked to you since the film came out. Just to start with you, Adam. What was the risk? Did anyone tell you that you're not allowed to say the things you said in the film? Did the irony loop come complete?\\n\\nADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN: It is interesting when people are talking about free speech, but it's free speech that they want to vet and make sure it's okay for them to hear before you can say it.\\n\\nI did notice the clip was all Dennis Prager, by the way, so I'm going to get my publicist on this.\\n\\nPRAGER: Yes. This resentment is a very big problem.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, I think he may be close to one of my producers.\\n\\nPRAGER: The problem is -- it's a big problem. We enjoy each other too much. We're looking for problems.\\n\\nCAROLLA: Yes. We're still kind of in the newly wed phase of our relationship.\\n\\nCARLSON: So what are -- but even newlyweds, they may sublimate it, but there's usually tension. If you could identify one thing that divides you bitterly, what would it be?\\n\\nCAROLLA: He likes gefilte fish, and I wouldn't feed that stuff to my cat.\\n\\nPRAGER: No, you said you did feed it.\\n\\nCAROLLA: Yes, I did. Feed it to my cat.\\n\\nPRAGER: Your cat liked it. I asked you specifically how it went over in the Corolla home. You said the cat loved it.\\n\\nCAROLLA: Yes, he gave me a jar of gefilte fish.\\n\\nPRAGER: Yes, I did.\\n\\nCAROLLA: By the way fish isn't supposed to be in jars. Just for your information. It should be on platters or it's supposed to be above a fireplace in a hunting lodge. Your aquarium. That's right.\\n\\nCARLSON: Exactly.\\n\\nPRAGER: By the way, this was the danger working with him.\\n\\nCARLSON: So has the problem gotten better?\\n\\nPRAGER: No.\\n\\nCAROLLA: The gefilte fish is as bad as it has ever been.\\n\\nCARLSON: No, that's -- I mean, I think that's there's not any room for improvement there at all. But the question of speech, do you think the country has become freer or less free in the last year?\\n\\nPRAGER: No, it's -- it is less free. There's no question. And you could -- there's an interesting proof. Read the reviewers in the mainstream media, not to mention left wing media, on how they have contempt for the film.\\n\\nWhen the film features liberal after liberal, including President Obama, speaking about what's going on, on campuses, but they can't even acknowledge that this is going on when they see the film, which is about the suppression of speech.\\n\\nCAROLLA: I have a slightly different feeling on it. Yes, well, here's what I think. I feel like the pendulum is starting to swing back the other direction.\\n\\nI mean, the comedic community and I feel a lot of my cohorts in the comedy world are starting to push back against it because they're at their saturation level. And I feel like the group that started this thing is starting to double down on it, starting to really work it harder.'\\n\\nIt's sort of the same subject is racism. As racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well.\\n\\nPRAGER: I think he is right about the comedic community. That's correct. Outside of that, I don't think it's true. San Francisco 49'er color announcer -- and I'm not sure you could use that term any longer -- simply said in describing the Baltimore Ravens quarterback who is a terrific quarterback and who is black and he said, you know, there might be the slight half second advantage in a handoff because the ball is black and the uniform is black and he is black. So the offensive line doesn't see it quite as quickly.\\n\\nAnd the guy was said, you're a racist. And unless he apologized profusely as in Mao's China in the Cultural Revolution, he would have lost his job.\\n\\nCAROLLA: Defensive line, but we know what you're talking about.\\n\\nCARLSON: So I wonder if we are at the point though where --\\n\\nPRAGER: That's right, defensive line. You are right and that was a boo- boo.\\n\\nCARLSON: I wonder if it's counterproductive -- okay, but the point remains, is it -- I mean, what about the people who are facing this problem and there are a lot of them, not just famous people, but normal people who are under attack by the HR department down the hall. What's the right response for them? Should they go through the Mao's China routine where they apologize and beg forgiveness? Or do they stand on principle?\\n\\nPRAGER: Well, I won't -- I don't know what Adam's position is on this. But I think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong. I don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong.\\n\\nIt's so humiliating that I personally couldn't do it.\\n\\nCAROLLA: Well, I think we're going to have to do it this way because I do my own podcast. I have my own pirate ship. I have autonomy. I can say what I want. I don't have to apologize. And thus, I'm not asked to apologize because I never apologize.\\n\\nBut for guys who do announcers for the 49'ers, what are they to do?\\n\\nPRAGER: No, I know. It's a horrible, horrible dilemma.\\n\\nCAROLLA: What we have to do is all stop apologizing at the same time. I mean, if there's one guy with a gun, we just have pool cues and we all need to charge them at once. If we do it one by one, we'll be taken out one by one.\\n\\nPRAGER: By the way, just let me remind people, because it's a great film.\\n\\nnosafespaces.com and they can find out where it's playing.\\n\\nCARLSON: And I think they will. Adam and Dennis. Good to see both tonight. Thank you.\\n\\nPRAGER: Thank you.\\n\\nCAROLLA: Thank you.\\n\\nCARLSON: So months after Jeffrey Epstein's death, however, that occurred, his alleged fixer is still free. Where is she? New reports tonight about where and who is protecting her? Remarkable story. Trace Gallagher fills us in after the break.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, according to multiple sources Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein's fixer, the person who facilitated his abuse of teenage girls.\\n\\nBut since Epstein's death, Maxwell has rarely appeared in public and has not been charged with any crime.\\n\\nNow, according to a new report, that is not an accident. Apparently she is being protected. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has more this story. Hey, Trace.\\n\\nTRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. The question has long lingered about whether his ex-girlfriend and confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell would face charges for allegedly recruiting and grooming these young girls for underage sex.\\n\\nBut our corporate cousin, The New York Post says, for now Maxwell is untouchable with the source saying, quote, Ghislaine is protected. She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments. They would trade information about the powerful people caught in his net -- caught at Epstein's house.\\n\\nAdding, quoting here, She is not in the U.S. She moves around. She is sometimes in the U.K., but most often in other countries such as Israel, where her powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.\\n\\nAnd separately, we should note, a friend of Ghislaine Maxwell tells The Sun newspaper that she has enough dirt on those powerful contacts that she expects to avoid any prosecution at all -- Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: A little test to whether justice is real. Trace Gallagher, thanks for much for that tonight. Good to see you.\\n\\nWell, that's it for us. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the show that's a sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Good night.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

{"original": "We learned last month that my colleague Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, had a friendly relationship for years with a Chinese spy. The Chinese Communist Party official funneled cash to Swalwell's campaign and even influenced hiring decisions in his congressional office.\\n\\nCongressman Swalwell sits on the House Intelligence Committee and had weekly access to highly-sensitive, classified material as a result.\\n\\nYet, he won't lose access to this information because members of Congress are far too often treated as a special political class, exempt from the rules that apply to the rest of our country. In this case, members of Congress are granted access to classified material without needing to go through the extensive security clearance process used to determine access to classified information that every civilian and member of the military goes through.\\n\\nThis is wrong and needs to change.\\n\\nMCCARTHY LAYS INTO PELOSI, CLAIMS DEMOCRATS AREN'T AWARE OF WHAT AMERICANS NEED\\n\\nWhen I was in the military, I had a TS-SCI and Q security clearance.\\n\\nTo obtain my clearance, I was interviewed and that including being asked psychological questions, allegiance questions, drug-use questions, lifestyle questions and even submitting to polygraphs in some cases.\\n\\nThen, my family and a person I knew at every single place I had lived, worked or attended school was interviewed to verify that the biography I provided was accurate.\\n\\nNext, these people gave the investigator names of people I knew whose names I did not provide so that they could also be interviewed.\\n\\nMy finances, bank records and more were also scrutinized.\\n\\nAs a member of Congress and former member of the military, I know from firsthand experience there is a big difference between being elected and being vetted to safeguard sensitive information.\\n\\nAs a result, I believe all members of Congress should be required to obtain a security clearance that can be taken away if they violate the public trust.\\n\\nTAMMY BRUCE SLAMS HOUSE DEMS' 'OBSCENELY MARXIST' DECISION TO REPLACE GENDERED LANGUAGE\\n\\nI put forward this proposal to be included in the rules package for the House of Representatives this week, which are the procedures that the House of Representatives will operate by for the next two years. Apparently to defend Rep. Swalwell and other members who leak information to their allies in the liberal media, Speaker Nancy Pelosi blocked my amendment.\\n\\nSpeaker Pelosi's dedication to protecting those who leak classified information is even more abhorrent when you consider what was included in the rules package:\\n\\nFirst, she included a provision striking so-called gendered language from the rules of the House of Representatives. This includes removing words she deems offensive such as mother, father, son and daughter—essentially restricting the House of Representatives from using these descriptions. This is yet another step toward forcing their radical, condescending, repressive and discriminatory views on all of us.\\n\\nPELOSI'S NEW HOUSE RULES ARE GENDER-NEUTRAL, CURTAIL GOP'S ABILITY TO FORCE 'GOTCHA' VOTES\\n\\nSecond, she further consolidated her own power by eliminating a vital tool used by the minority party to ensure the American people are represented.\\n\\nFor more than a century, the House rules have provided the minority with one last chance to make their voices heard before a bill is passed by introducing amendments to the final text and guaranteeing a vote on those amendments. Under this rules package, this safeguard—called the Motion To Recommit—has been eliminated.\\n\\nSpeaker Pelosi is not stopping there. A third provision in the rules package codifies censorship over members of the House, subjecting them to disciplinary action if they post or share information deemed to be distorted or manipulated.\\n\\nThe question, of course, is deemed by who?\\n\\nThe tech giants so eager to assert control over what is allowed to be shared don't have a great track record when it comes to deciding what information is accurate.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nIn the weeks leading up to the November election, for example, Twitter banned the account of the New York Post for a story discussing an investigation into Hunter Biden even though the Department of Justice later confirmed the investigation was taking place. This rule change will hand Democrats and their allies in Silicon Valley another weapon to wield against Republicans whose opinions they dislike.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of many that show a clear trend: Speaker Pelosi is more interested in maintaining her position atop the Washington, D.C. political class and satiating the radical desires of her followers than protecting our country's national security.\\n\\nCongressman Swalwell and other members of Congress from any party who do not take the responsibility to safeguard classified information seriously would lose access to this information if they were anybody else.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nYet again, however, the Pelosi Doctrine is do as I say, not as I do.\\n\\nOur country is less safe as a result.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

{"original": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the roster: There are no corners in an oval office - Bernie gets banged up - Pelosi talks down impeachment - Audible: Massachusetts woman enjoys human embrace - Five second rule does not apply\\n\\n\\n\\nTHERE ARE NO CORNERS IN AN OVAL OFFICE\\n\\nHaving more than 800,000 federal workers not getting paid, garbage piling up and the multitudinous second-order consequences of a partial government shutdown over the paltry – by federal standards at least – sum of about $3 billion was too farcical even for our current political moment.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo to keep it going and keep each party's electoral bases committed to the fight, the president is raising the stakes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhether or not this shambling shutdown harms or helps either political party and to what degree is an entirely open question. But for now, at least, we can conclusively say that it benefits the narrow interests of President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Trump it has put him back in the driver's seat. He got to be president by being the best at manipulating media coverage and those skills have obviously not left him entirely.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe're not talking about Special Counsel Robert Mueller or the agenda of the new Democratic House of Representatives or the topsy turvy economy. Like the North Korea summit, the ill-fated election fraud commission and other Trump showstoppers, the semi-shutdown is catnip for coverage and the engagement of his longtime supporters but doesn't add up to much.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor Pelosi, it has mostly kept the insurrectionists in her conference in check, mother truckers notwithstanding. Democrats may disagree on may things, but sticking it to Trump is not one of them. War with Trump makes life simpler and power more easily wielded.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem, as with every shutdown, is not how to get it started but rather how to get it stopped.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump's problem was that he had painted himself in a corner. His demand was so small it sounded petty. When your government is running a $1 trillion deficit, it seems more than a little churlish to have all of these histrionics over a few billion dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\nFriday of this week is payday for many of those affected workers who, if a resolution is not found, have gone a month without salary. Soon enough, walkouts, the blue flu, furious passengers standing in line at airports and other problems will start piling up.\\n\\n\\n\\nLast Friday, Trump raised the stakes saying that the shutdown wasn't about $3 billion but rather about a comprehensive immigration reform effort. That may be too much in the other direction since such a goal is unlikely to be achieved, but it's certainly raises the stakes to a point that seems worth the trouble.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, Trump is going to use his first-ever Oval Office address – the .44 Magnum in the presidential communications arsenal – to lay out this comprehensive plan. He will also, presumably, throw in some bar talk about invoking a national emergency to use extraordinary executive powers to get his way.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe intent here is to get Pelosi on defense and cast her as unwilling to deal with a huge issue of major importance to most Americans. It's not a format that suits the president, who struggles with scripted speeches, but if he can pull it off, could dramatically alter the political moment.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith roadblock coverage across all television broadcast and news stations, Trump will have a moment to tell the country what he really wants in simple, unambiguous terms. What does a deal that he would support look like.\\n\\n\\n\\nOr, he will go on another discursion about slats and concrete and what somebody's cousin Pete told him and the moment will be wasted and the next time he says he wants to address the nation it will get yawns.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe president has bluffed, bullied and wheedled his way into a very consequential moment. Now we'll find out what he wants to do with it.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: IT'S ALWAYS THE LAST ONE YOU SUSPECT\\n\\nFor it is a truth, which the experience of ages has attested, that the people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the least suspicion. – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 25\\n\\n\\n\\nTIME OUT: LE SPIDER-MAN\\n\\nEnjoy a brief excerpt from a piece by the New Yorker's Jake Halpern about the skilled climber and thief referred to as Spider-Man by the French press. New Yorker: Long before the burglar Vjeran Tomic became the talk of Paris, he honed his skills in a graveyard. … At the age of ten, Tomic pulled off his first heist. He broke into a library in Mostar, climbing through a window that was nearly ten feet above street level. He stole two books, each of which appeared to be several hundred years old. … Tomic said of his early criminal adventures, 'It was intuitive. Nobody ever taught me anything.' … In time, Tomic began robbing apartments in more affluent neighborhoods. His climbing skills continued to improve, and by the age of sixteen he could scale the façade of a multistory building with relative ease. … One night, he had a vivid dream in which he stole five paintings from a museum. He took it as a portent. As he wrote to me, 'I knew that someday I would do something great.'\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nSCOREBOARD\\n\\nTrump job performance\\n\\nAverage approval: 42 percent\\n\\nAverage disapproval: 53.4 percent\\n\\nNet Score: -11.4 points\\n\\nChange from one week ago: unchanged\\n\\n[Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 39% approve - 52% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 52% disapprove.]\\n\\n\\n\\nBERNIE GETS BANGED UP\\n\\nFox News: As Bernie Sanders gears up for a likely second run at the Democratic presidential nomination, the Vermont senator finds himself facing a much higher level of scrutiny than he ever endured in 2016. … The allegations of harassment and sexism in Sanders' 2016 campaign – which emerged in reports last week by The New York Times and Politico – are raising new questions even among some of Sanders' strongest supporters. … And the home-state Barre Montpelier Times Argus newspaper just published a blistering editorial that began, 'Bernie Sanders should not run for president. In fact, we beg him not to.' The editorial listed several points, including the sexual harassment allegations, while noting they are not directed at him personally. But more broadly, the piece warned… 'It is one thing to start a revolution, but at a certain point you need to know when to step out of the way and let others carry the water for you.'\\n\\n\\n\\nBe best: Biden tells friends nobody in Dem field can top him - NYT: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in the final stages of deciding whether to run for president and has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat President Trump, an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. Many Democratic voters, and nearly all major Democratic donors, are keenly interested in Mr. Biden's plans because of their consuming focus on finding a candidate who can beat a president they believe represents a threat to American democracy. But there is also a rising demand in the party for a more progressive standard-bearer who reflects the increasingly diverse Democratic coalition. Mr. Biden would instantly be the early front-runner if he ran, but he would have to bridge divides in a primary…\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump campaign moving fast to rig nomination - Politico: President Donald Trump is tightening his iron grip on the Republican Party, launching an elaborate effort to stamp out any vestiges of GOP opposition that might embarrass him at the 2020 Republican convention. The president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. The effort comes as party elites like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney are openly questioning Trump's fitness for the job, and it's meant to ensure that delegates to next year's convention in Charlotte, N.C., are presidential loyalists… Trump political aides Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, the organizers of the project, held a national conference call with Republican state party chairs, who traditionally play an outsize role in picking delegates. Last week, the two advisers began having one-on-one calls with the state chairs to describe the campaign's mission and discuss various circumstances in each state.\\n\\n\\n\\nJ. V. Last: 'The Trump Primary Has Already Begun' - The Bulwark: The smartest thing Barack Obama ever did was running for president when everyone thought Hillary Clinton was invincible. The second smartest thing he did was invite Clinton into his Cabinet and keep her there through his first term. Obama understood that avoiding a primary challenge is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for re-election. … President Trump, on the other hand, seems to be daring someone to run against him in 2020. He frequently insults his fellow Republicans and has made almost no effort to mend fences… He did not bring the people most likely to run against him—John Kasich and Mitt Romney—into his administration. And he has not kept the people who would be most dangerous to him—Nikki Haley and Jim Mattis—on his team. If you only looked at this top-line data, you'd almost think Trump wants a primary challenger. Maybe he does.\\n\\n\\n\\nPELOSI TALKS DOWN IMPEACHMENT\\n\\nWaPo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to quell a rising furor Sunday over whether Democratic lawmakers will seek to impeach President Trump, saying in an interview on CBS News's 'Sunday Morning' that the public has yet to hear the conclusions of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation. Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. … Pelosi's remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who said calls for Trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from Democrats' 'substantive agenda.' … Pelosi's remarks come amid days of Democratic infighting after newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) vowed … to 'impeach the motherf-----,' referring to Trump. Many of Tlaib's colleagues have cautioned against moving too quickly toward impeachment. Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) on Sunday told ABC News that impeaching Trump would be 'an unbelievably serious undertaking.'\\n\\n\\n\\nBut investigations to come fast and furious - Politico: Democrats want to investigate the Trump Hotel deal and President Donald Trump's taxes. They want to haul up conflicted Cabinet officials and dig into controversial changes to the census and food stamps. They want to put Education Secretary Betsy DeVos under oath and investigate child detentions at the border. The threat of subpoenas, investigations and oversight hearings will dominate the new House Democratic majority agenda, targeting the White House's most controversial policies and personnel, spanning immigration, the environment, trade and of course, the biggest question of them all: Russian collusion. … But for House Democrats in control for the first time in nearly a decade, it's also a role full of pitfalls. Trump has already tried to brand the prospect of congressional oversight as nothing more than 'harassment,' and Democrats will also have to show they can legislate, govern and investigate all at the same time in the House.\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nPergram: 'The outsiders move inside: New to Congress, with all the pitfalls' - Fox News\\n\\n\\n\\nBustos unveils ambitious plans for DCCC - Politico\\n\\n\\n\\nBolton puts terms on Trump's initial threat of Syria troop withdrawal - AP\\n\\n\\n\\nRubio gets bipartisan backing for foreign policy bill aimed at bolstering Israel - The Intercept\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump's consequential SupCo gambles piling up - USA Today\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDIBLE: MASSACHUSETTS WOMAN ENJOYS HUMAN EMBRACE\\n\\nI love it. I'm a hugger. – Sen. Elizabeth Warren telling the Des Moines Register about the number of hugs she received on her recent trip to Iowa.\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\\n\\nI think your history comment for [Friday] is a bit off or at least does not tell the whole story. The 44 Colt model of 1847 was a collaboration of Sam Walker and Colt in 1846-47. Walker was with the Texas Rangers at the time and wanted a more powerful weapon for the Mexican-American war. The 1000 US military orders were for the State of Texas Military is my understanding. The 44 Walker was the most powerful handgun until the 357 Magnum came along in 1935. They were called 'horse pistols' as they commonly were carried on the pommel of the saddle. These were powerful, accurate repeating weapons. Sam Walker carried two at the time of his death. Military Walkers are stamped with the US and 1847 on the left side of the revolver. Original Walkers are exceptionally expensive. Beat up ones might set you back 40 to 60 thousand dollars while the few really nice ones that are properly authenticated go for nearly a million. I attached a few pictures of me shooting my replica. They are fun guns to shoot and it teaches you a lot about patience as it takes a while to load up the black powder (pyrodex replica in my case) and it is quite powerful. My targets are not the best in the world but certainly show that the revolver could be quite accurate at 25 yards. The center group is 2 cylinders worth or 12 shots so a Ranger armed with a couple of Walkers would be force to be reckoned with. Keep up the great work on the Halftime Report.

Apparently to cause a traffic hazard, according to Cherokee County authorities. No, seriously. It's not a joke. The Cherokee County EMA is asking drivers to not eat the chicken fingers left on Highway 35 in a late Sunday night Facebook post. The tenders spilled on the roadway during an 18-wheeler wreck. The cases, which have been on the ground for 24 hours, aren't safe to eat, authorities warn. What's worse? Diving for free chicken tenders could land you in hot water with the law.

{"original": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made his first public appeal for the United States to officially recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.\\n\\nThe Golan Heights is tremendously important for our security, Netanyahu said in Jerusalem, alongside U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton on Sunday night, adding Israel will never leave the Golan Heights, and stressed the gravity of all countries recognizing the region as Israeli territory.\\n\\nNetanyahu also acknowledged he has previously raised the matter behind closed doors with President Trump, who reportedly supported the idea. But Trump was concerned by a possible rebuke from Russia, the leading international authority and staunch supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which mandates Israel is Syrian territory.\\n\\nMuch of the international community regards the Golan Heights as part of Syria, albeit under Israeli occupation, since the neighboring nation took it during the 1967 Six-Day War. Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz have both called for the Trump administration to observe Israel's sovereignty in the Golan by putting forward bills, which the White House is yet to take a position on.\\n\\nOne Israeli intelligence source told Fox News there is a good chance the U.S. will heed the request, as quite simply they live there, they recognize it as Israeli, and it's just a matter of the United States also making that formal recognition. The move would be seen as similar to the controversial decision last year to relocate the American embassy to the Israeli capital of Jerusalem.\\n\\nNetanyahu's latest push, which comes on the heels of Trump's announcement that the U.S military will completely withdraw from Syria, has picked up both positive and negative reactions from experts and analysts.\\n\\nIt seems increasingly likely the United States is prepared to officially recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel. Acknowledging Israeli sovereignty over the strategically-critical heights would obviously be in Israel's interest, but also in the interest of the United States, explained Jonathan Ruhe, Associate Director, JINSA's Gemunder Center for Defense and Strategy. It would underscore U.S. support for Israel's self-defense, in particular against Iran and its proxies in neighboring Syria – an issue that's increasingly important as the United States reduces its own presence in that country and relies increasingly on its Middle East allies to push back against Tehran.\\n\\nSYRIA CEASEFIRE BROKERED BY US, RUSSIA HOLDING, BUT WITH FLAWS, 'TRICKS' IN PLAY\\n\\nKEANU REEVES' PICTURE AMONG TOOLS IN CHINA'S CRACKDOWN ON UIGHUR MINORITY\\n\\nYet Ruhe emphasized potential blowback in the form of negative reactions from the rest of the Middle East – including from Israel's Arab partners would not be out of the question.\\n\\nBut as we saw with the embassy move to Jerusalem, this wouldn't necessarily have strategic or enduring negative consequences for the United States or Israel, Ruhe continued. Moreover, unlike the issue of Jerusalem, the Golan wouldn't be part of any future Israel-Palestinian peace agreement, making U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty much more straightforward than any issue involving Jerusalem or other territories like the West Bank.\\n\\nAnd according to Raphael Marcus, Visiting Research Fellow at the Department of War Studies at the King's College London the Golan Heights indeed remains strategically and militarily important for Israel, in light of Iranian and Hezbollah operational activity in southern Syria, specifically on the Syrian side of the Golan.\\n\\nSince at least 2015, both Iranian military operatives and Hezbollah have attempted to set up forward military outposts to threaten and attack Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan, he cautioned. Additionally, the murderous Assad regime is obviously not a responsible world player, and it remains a security interest of Israel to keep the Golan Heights which provides a critical vantage point over northern Israel.\\n\\nBut others view it as Israel using the U.S in an overreaching quest.\\n\\nThis is another sign of how the Israeli government sees in the Trump administration an unprecedented opportunity to advance goals long rejected by the international community, said Ben White, journalist, and author of Cracks in the Wall: Beyond Apartheid in Palestine/Israel. Should Netanyahu get his wish, then we might also be another step closer to Israel's formal annexation of some, or all, of the occupied West Bank.\\n\\nMichael Koplow, Policy Director, Israel Policy Forum pointed out that while remaining in the Golan is a security imperative for Israel, perhaps creating a long-scale stand at this time is not necessary.\\n\\nThe drawback to formal American recognition of Israeli sovereignty on the Golan, however, is that it is an issue that has been entirely non-controversial, unlike Israel's presence in the West Bank. Israel can easily maintain the status quo on the Golan without any U.S. recognition whatsoever, but American recognition runs the risk of turning what has been a quiet issue into one that all of a sudden becomes controversial once the spotlight is shone on it, he added. It may end up swapping a security win for a public relations win, which is particularly dangerous now given the heightened importance of keeping the Golan quiet as the Syrian endgame includes a permanent Iranian presence across the Israeli border."}

We didn't have physical barriers in Naco, and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially.\\n\\nThe American people deserved to hear this riveting testimony, as well as the words of those who followed. But millions of viewers were robbed of this opportunity when one of the networks, MSNBC, cut away from the press briefing right after President Trump's remarks.\\n\\nAccording to CNN, an MSNBC spokesperson said that such decisions are made on a case by case basis driven by the substance of the briefings and the pace of the day's news. MSNBC, in other words, saw no substance in letting the American people hear what the real experts had to say about border security.\\n\\nSadly, this form of manipulative reporting isn't an isolated phenomenon. In June, both CNN and MSNBC cut away from a White House event addressing immigration, interrupting harrowing stories of real victims of illegal immigrant violence in order to cover more humdrum content.\\n\\nJust after 3 p.m., as the victims were still telling their stories, CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin interrupted the coverage, The Washington Examiner reported at the time. At almost the same time on MSNBC, anchor Chris Jansing broke into the live coverage. 'Of course their stories are indeed tragic,' she said, before moving on to a segment that disputed Trump's assertion that there is widespread crime committed by illegal immigrants.\\n\\nIn advance of the president's address to the nation from the Oval Office on Tuesday night, the major television networks reportedly agonized over whether to even run the address, citing concerns that the speech could be used to promote untruths.\\n\\nWhile almost all the networks and cable news outlets ultimately decided to adhere to long-standing precedent and air the Oval Office address, many of them went out of their way to include live fact-checking of the speech based on their baseless assumption that President Trump would not be truthful.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, many journalists – who are in complete denial about the legal and humanitarian crises at the border – accused the president of exaggerating the ongoing catastrophe. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, for instance, called Americans stupid for believing that the crisis exists at all.\\n\\n[President Trump] is going to be telling nothing but lies and falsehoods, and he's going to be twisting reality, he proclaimed prior to the address. And at this point I've got to say, how stupid are Americans who still believe there's a crisis on the southern border?\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIt's perhaps no surprise that Scarborough is skeptical about the reality of the border crisis.

Progressive groups said the limitation would hinder them from realizing some of their more aggressive goals.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez had voted with Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.\\n\\nThe pay-go principle, Ocasio-Cortez charged in a tweet Wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\\n\\nAlso shot down was Justice Democrats' bid to have Tlaib placed on the Appropriations Committee, which announced a list of new members on Thursday that did not include Tlaib. The critical committee handles government expenditures.\\n\\nIn my 12 years here, I don't think there's ever been a freshman on Approps, Ways and Means or Energy and Commerce, Kentucky Democratic Rep.

Katie Porter to join the financial services committee.\\n\\nDespite the setbacks, there is some reason for optimism among progressive groups.

{"original": "This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, January 6, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nLAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: And yes, as Hannity said, I am back. And I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from of course, we're back. So, it's a really busy Washington. Now, and moments, I am going to explain why the killing of an Iranian General Qasem Soleimani reveals Trump as a true pragmatist.\\n\\nAlso, two of the biggest Congressional players in the impeachment drama react to today's announcement from John Bolton about his potential testimony. Senator Ron Johnson and Congressman Doug Collins among others are here exclusively.\\n\\nPlus, President Trump has a way of revealing folks, doesn't he? For who they really are. Mollie Hemingway, Mike Huckabee, they're going to tell us how the Left and the media are now defending the world's largest state- sponsor of terrorism. I thought I'd seen it all until the last few days.\\n\\nAnd Raymond Arroyo is here. Now, this is special. It's a Monday appearance for Raymond. But of course, when the Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais gave celebs some really great advice at the award show. Too bad they didn't listen. He's going to explain later in the show why something I wrote 17 years ago was a little bit ahead of its time.\\n\\nBut first, Trump, the realist. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.\\n\\nAs with issues like immigration and trade, on the Iran situation, President Trump has been forced to clean up the messes created by previous two administrations. Now post 9/11, George W. Bush thought that once we invaded Iraq, WMD or no WMD, once we kill Saddam Hussein and then disbanded the Iraqi military. Well, democratic institutions would eventually take flower. Well, that was a colossal and cruel joke.\\n\\nThe Kurds were happy and did greet us as liberators. But with the evil Saddam gone, Iran was also empowered and started building many of the IEDs that killed so many coalition forces.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nGEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time. But it is worth every effort.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: We're still waiting for that. Well, in February 2006, when I was broadcasting my radio show from Iraq, the enlisted soldiers, some on their third deployment at that point told me, they said Laura, the place is a disaster. Iran is crawling around everywhere or their emissaries. They're building these weapons that are blowing up my buddies. But back then, I frankly didn't want to believe it.\\n\\nNow two years later, Obama was elected in part on his promise to pull us out of Iraq. Of course, Obama took a completely different approach. He made things worse. He thought that as long as we ended combat operations in Iraq, we could bribe Iran to get better behavior from Iran. So, the $1.7 billion was the settlement of a decades old arbitration claim between the U.S. and Iran. An initial 400 million of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency was delivered on pallets, January 17th. Now that's the same day, Tehran agreed to release four American prisoners.\\n\\nNow, pallets of cash were delivered in the dark of night to the Iranian regime. Now, one of the most disgusting acts of American capitulation, I can recall in my lifetime. Remember also the Iran nuclear deal itself was full of holes, but Secretary of State John Kerry, he insisted it was the best we could do and thought Iran's signing on to that agreement would be a stabilizing process.\\n\\nOf course, nothing could have been further from the truth. There is no evidence that Iran started behaving any better after the deal and in no serious Republican or Democrat is even attempting at this point to argue that. Iran never released Bob Levinson, a former CIA officer, whom they've held for 13 years, ditto for at least five other American who've been held prisoner on absurd spurious grounds.\\n\\nTerror acts committed by Iran's proxies have continued unabated and the Islamic Republic was behind the rocket attacks on our embassy in Baghdad and in Basra in 2018. The Shiite militia rocket attack that killed an American contractor and wounded four U.S. troops, just two weeks ago was the 11th barrage in just two months.\\n\\nNow, this doesn't even take into account by the way all of the other American blood that they have on their hands.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are also responsible for 17 percent of all-American soldiers' deaths in the Iraq war between 2003 and 2011.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Back to the point I was making earlier about the time I was there in 2006 and what I was hearing. And General Qasem Soleimani, he wasn't some bit player in all of this.He was the orchestrator of these terrorist assaults. The attack on the U.S.\\n\\nembassy in Iraq was just the latest. He was also so brazen and so comfortable, this really blows my mind, by the way that he was freely operating at the Baghdad airport. I'm surprised he was like working in a bookstore there. He was planning to kill or terrorize more Americans, very bold about it.\\n\\nThus, handed these cards and with the escalation on the ground that put our troops and personnel at risk, Donald Trump had to weigh the options and he had to make a decision. So, was it better for the U.S. to allow Soleimani to parade openly around Iraq with no forceful response after he fomented the attack on our embassy and was plotting more?\\n\\nPresident Trump decided that the answer was an emphatic no.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We would've been culpably negligent had we not taken this action, the American people would have said that we weren't doing the right thing to protect and defend American lives. President Trump has been crystal clear.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Ordering an airstrike on Soleimani was given all the facts and all the history, we just went over. A perfectly reasonable decision. So, will this trigger some retaliation from Iran? Perhaps. But the world's leading state-sponsor of terrorism, they certainly didn't need any excuse to wreak havoc against American interests. They've been doing that for a long time. They've been our enemy for like over 40 years.\\n\\nDemocrats accuse the President of acting precipitously though and destabilizing the region, which isn't surprising. If Trump says the sky is up, they're going to say, it's down. But think about this for a moment.\\n\\nMost Democrats today believe that we as Americans are safer with that murderous thug alive and boldly spreading his influence in the country where we lost thousands of our servicemen? Really? These are the same people by the way who called themselves anti-war when Obama was president. But they never gave Trump credit for his policy of military restraint.\\n\\nAs is so often the case, Trump forces Democrats to reveal themselves and the media. They're so caught up with resisting and hating Trump for everything he does and breeze that over the weekend, they literally sounded more empathetic to the mourners of an Iranian mass murderer than to the families of the soldiers he killed and maimed with attacks carried out inside Iraq.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In Iran, he is seen as a revered military leader. So, he had enormous respect and position there.\\n\\nFAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: It's difficult to convey how revered he is in Iran. This guy is regarded in Iran as a completely heroic figure, personally very brave.\\n\\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was a targeted attack on a government, official, a high-ranking military official.\\n\\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: I was trying to think of somebody, and I was thinking of de Gaulle.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Remember, when Bill Marr got into all that trouble for saying the9/11 attackers were a reference and as courageous. What are these guys doing? Whereas Bush was too idealistic about what was possible in Iraq and whereas Obama was too defeatist about Iran, Trump's a realist, he's a pragmatist.\\n\\nHe made a calculation that as long as this general was alive, things would be more dangerous for the United States. Soleimani was not acting as a brake on the Iranian regime. He was acting as an accelerant.\\n\\nIt's the Democrats position of appeasement toward Iran that's endangered American interests and allies for years and years. If our position, a friend of mine gave me this idea, I wish I could claim it as my own. But if our position right now, we listen to the Democrats is that we cannot eliminate a known and unrepentant terrorist for fear of reprisals from his homeland. Then that means the situation in the region is truly hopeless.\\n\\nAnd thus, if that's what we believe, then we should agree all of us on an immediate withdrawal of all troops from the region. Otherwise, the troops are just sitting ducks along with contractors, NGOs et cetera.\\n\\nPresident Trump decided that the status quo was unacceptable. He was and is correct. Now, I want to say it's very important. You know my views on these endless wars. It's important that the President listens to his judgment here, that he doesn't listen to the same people who got sucked into Iraq in the first place.\\n\\nThe Bush doctrine is dead, and Trump helped bury it. Thank God. His recent tweets notwithstanding, the President, I think is very smart, he's very smart enough to know that another war of choice or needless escalation will end up harming American interests, not to speak of his re-election chances.\\n\\nAmerica First, America Safe, America Strategic, America Smart. And that's The Angle.\\n\\nAll right, joining me now is Congressman Michael Waltz, House Armed Services Committee Member and the first Green Beret to serve in Congress.\\n\\nAlso, with me is retired Brigadier General, Robert Spaulding, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former Director for Strategy at the NSC, as well as Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.\\n\\nCongressman Waltz let's start with you.\\n\\nWhy are the Left and the Never Trumpers really upset that Trump acted?\\n\\nREP. MICHAEL WALTZ, R-FLA.: Well, first I want to say Laura, you're absolutely right and as a combat veteran, I find it appalling, some of this criticism. And my question for the Left is, how many American body bags are enough. Because apparently, 600 wasn't enough from the Iraq war and we want to just have more and more and more before it's OK for the President to stop this escalation and act.\\n\\nAnd secondly, you know they've got this false choice that they're throwing out there, either we do nothing and continue to appease the terrorists, or we have World War III with D-Day style invasions of Tehran. There is a lot of room in between. There is a lot of options. That is not on the table and nor does the President need authorization to defend our embassies, to defend our troops to strike back and to stop this escalation. He's absolutely right. We're preventing further war. We're not escalating into war. We're stopping Iran's escalation. And I think it was absolutely the right move.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: First, the Democrats, they didn't like that Trump was pulling troops out of the Middle East, trying to end these endless wars. Now, they're upset that he's taking action.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: I really worry that the actions the President took will get us into what he calls another endless war in the Middle East.\\n\\nIf in Congress and I will do everything I can to assert our authority, we do not need this President either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: General?\\n\\nBRIG GEN ROBERT SPALDING, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, this I mean clearly what the President did improved our - probably our stability in the Middle East and security of American forces there, for two reasons.\\n\\nOne, deterrence is about capability and intent. The strike clearly shows the President's intent to punish Iran, if they cross the line.\\n\\nAnd second, Soleimani was hopscotching around the Middle East--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: It's unbelievable.\\n\\nSPALDING: Creating chaos, everywhere he went. Quite frankly, I'd given up hope that we were going to do the right thing with regard to his actions all the way back to my time in Iraq back in 2007.\\n\\nWALTZ: We should have a long time ago. A long time ago.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Literally. I was rah rah war in Iraq, because I love our troops. I support our troops. Those enlisted guys remember Trump met with the enlisted soldiers couple of weeks ago. They kept saying, Iran, the story is Iran. Don't drop Iran. That's the story. Remember, General Casey, he didn't really want to get into the Iran situation with me in an interview. I like him a lot, but he didn't want to touch that. I'm telling you; this Iran thing has been brewing for so long, it's been happening for deadly consequences.\\n\\nWALTZ: A terrorist is a terrorist whether they're Shia or Sunni, whether they're wearing a foreign uniform or whether they're not.\\n\\nSPALDING: We spent billions on MRAPs and we never did a thing about the IEDs that were the cause of having to build those MRAPs.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well we - Victor Davis Hanson, I want to go to you on this.\\n\\nBernie Sanders spoke out tonight about this situation. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You can say there are a lot of bad people all over the world running governments. The President of China now has put a million people in - Muslims into educational camps, some would call them concentration camps. But once you start this business of a major country saying, hey, we have the right to assassinate, then you are unleashing international anarchy.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Victor, he also compared this to Putin's killing his dissidents. He also said that. Reaction.\\n\\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Yes, I think that Trump has really confused people, Laura, because he showed restraint by not reacting to the interception of ships in the Gulf of Hormuz earlier. He didn't react to the drone attack. And then when he did, he didn't brag about it.\\n\\nRemember in 2012, Joe Biden toured the country right before the campaign or during the campaign said, bin Laden is dead. GM is alive. Then when Hillary went into Libya and Gaddafi was pretty horrifically murdered on the street, she said, we came, we saw, ha-ha-ha, he died. He hasn't done that.\\n\\nAnd I think what Trump - everybody understands, and this is what frustrates the Democrats is, he's got a very unique view of the Middle East. He's saying you know what we don't need its oil anymore, we're self-sufficient.\\n\\nIsrael is self-sufficient in oil. The Arab street is on our side, it's anti-Iranian and the Palestinians have lost their global resonance.\\n\\nAnd so, it's a new situation, the Middle East is not in the middle of anything anymore and yet he's saying that in this situation with Iran, we were very patient and now we've reestablished deterrence and the levers that adjudicate whether one side wins or loses a war or diplomatic, economic and military. And in this particular situation with Iran they have neither. None of those three and all their decisions are bad in their case.\\n\\nAnd Trump is saying, we reacted. I showed restraint. Now it's your turn, see what you're going to do, and I don't think they're going to do what everybody thinks we're going to do, because they don't really have any options.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\\n\\nHANSON: And it's very hard to be an interventionist when - yes.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, and even Merkel was saying, it was justified. But I want to go back to this point because I am not a neoconservative. I do believe we have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure and the American people clearly don't want that; we're never going back to those days Those days are over. The Republican Party and they don't want that anymore. Maybe people at defense contractors want it and make a lot of money, I understand that, but that's what not the people want.\\n\\nThe Atlantic today, I'm going to read this. Title was, it's 2003 all over again, Congressman Waltz. The factors that made the Iraq war a disaster are present here, false and dubious claims, hubristic thinking, lack of foresight and planning, civilian military divides, ideology eclipsing practical strategy, all of this means that while the Iran crisis might not be the disaster on the scale of the Iraq war, it could easily be a disaster. Your reaction to that. Are we creeping into a potential long conflict with Iran?\\n\\nWALTZ: No, I don't think we are. I think this was a response to stop the series of escalations. The President's made it clear that if they escalate again, our response will be overwhelming. The last thing the Iranian regime wants is a war with the United States because the thing they value the most is their own survival and they know they would be destroyed in such a conflict. They have in a whole history of escalating right up to the edge and when faced with strength, they backed down.\\n\\nWhen faced with weakness, they're emboldened, and they'll continue.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I just still can't believe; he was in the airport.\\n\\nWALTZ: Until--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: It's unbelievable.\\n\\nWALTZ: They're stopped. So, I think that's the dynamic. The President understands the dynamic. And to the Atlantic, we're not looking to build Switzerland. The Trump administration is not looking to create Switzerland or a perfect democracy, but we do still have a counter-terrorism mission.\\n\\nAnd what Obama missed was just pull everybody home and wish the problem away.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Give them their rights.\\n\\nWALTZ: Right. And we got ISIS, we got attacks throughout Europe. We got inspired attacks in the United States. So, even though the energy play is lessened, the counter-terrorism piece is still real. But that doesn't mean we have a million American troops; we can do that with a very small footprint forward.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: General Spalding, a lot of people on the Left are focusing on the reference to the cultural sites in a tweet by the President, saying that that comment - even a reference to it, reference to it could unify the Iranian people who don't even agree on these issues and probably want this regime gone against Washington. Are you concerned about that?\\n\\nSPALDING: I actually think the Iranian leadership is going to have to take a reassessment based on the strike. So, whatever language the President uses, it kind of reinforces this sense of unpredictability on - so they don't know where the line is. And if they don't know where the line is, they have to reassess. And I think you're going to see a level of stability as a result, not just in Iran. I think it sends a message to Beijing, to Moscow and Pyongyang that they need to pay attention to what the President is saying.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: VDH, really quickly. Speaking of China, I'm always focused on China you know. Victor and I are China focused as is General Spalding. What are they thinking here? What's their angle on this potential conflagration if there is one?\\n\\nHANSON: They don't know what Trump is going to do. They didn't think he would ever initiate tariffs. North Korea doesn't know what he's going to do. And so, meanwhile, time and all three of these situations on the U.S.\\n\\nside because China needs a recalibration of this tension with us. It's not sustainable for them.\\n\\nAnd the same thing with North Korea, these sanctions are sharvy North Korea and all of the cards, everybody is hysterical Laura, but the cards - if you just look at it dispassionately or on our side with Iran, with North Korea, with China, it will just calm down and let these things play out. We're the ones with the sanctions. We're the ones with a strong economy. We're the ones with the largest military. And as long as we don't overreach or try to as you say nation build or go into some large expedition, we're in great shape.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Trump's not going to do that.\\n\\nHANSON: I think that's what's frustrating with the Democrats. I think they understand that. They don't know what to do about it.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But you see Chuck Schumer reading those comments. I mean he's been in Senate for like decades. He should read his comments. He knows what he thinks, doesn't he or does he not? What do you think? When he's on the Sunday shows. Very odd.\\n\\nGentlemen, great discussion. Thank you so much, all of you.\\n\\nWALTZ: Thank you.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: And John Bolton says, he's now willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial, if he's subpoenaed. But is that going to happen? And what effect will it have? Senator Ron Johnson is here exclusively with reaction. Plus, was killing Soleimani illegal. That's new thing they're claiming. Congressman Doug Collins, I cannot wait to hear him on that. Stay there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Oh! Could the Left actually see one of their impeachment fantasies come to fruition. John Bolton testifying in the Senate trial.\\n\\nWhile the former National Security Adviser said today that he would testify if he received a Senate subpoena. If. Of course, Democrats are using this as a political cudgel against Republicans.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSCHUMER: Given that Mr. Bolton's lawyers have stated, he has new and relevant information to share. If any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we've requested, they would make it absolutely clear, they are participating in a cover-up.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: So, the senators are participating in a cover-up or the White House. I'm trying to keep it all straight. Our next guest actually spoke to John Bolton about the Ukraine mess last August, I shouldn't think the Left should be celebrating.\\n\\nJoining me now, exclusively Senator Ron Johnson, Chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Senator, Bolton seems like he's latest in the long line of the silver bullets, the Left believes it has here. What do you think?\\n\\nSEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Well, first of all, Happy New Year, Laura.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Happy New Year. Thanks for coming on. We've been trying to get you in a while.\\n\\nJOHNSON: I'm not sure what else John would really add to this. I haven't spoken to him since - we really talking about Ukraine. We share the same position, but from my standpoint, President Trump has been unbelievably consistent in why he had reservations about Ukraine. And it starts as a candidate when he didn't think Europe was doing enough in their own defense. And then, throw that into that mix, the corruption of Ukraine.\\n\\nThat's what he stated in the White House on March 23rd.\\n\\nHe was consistent in my conversation on August 31st and talking to John Bolton, making the same point. So, I don't know what else he would add. But the House obviously didn't make their case, so they're hoping that the Senate will make the case for them. That's not our job.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But what is that scenario, where the House doesn't go to court to get it - to try to enforce a subpoena, but now they're like foisting it on McConnell. So, now McConnell - you have to--\\n\\nJOHNSON: We're supposed to.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You have to issue a subpoena that would - that - you have to go to court, get a subpoena and push it forward. How does that ever work?\\n\\nJOHNSON: Well, I don't think it does.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\\n\\nJOHNSON: And so again, I don't know what Nancy Pelosi is doing to me. Her strategy seems totally bizarre. What I hope is this week, our conference will come together. I don't think we should let Nancy Pelosi run the Senate. And so, the Wall Street Journal, you should have had a column a couple weeks ago basically suggesting we should change the rules of Senate, don't require articles of impeachment be delivered. They already voted on it. We take up the trial. We basically tell Nancy Pelosi; we start the trial Tuesday at 1 o'clock.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Show up or not.\\n\\nJOHNSON: Bring your managers, if not the President's team will have his defense ready. And if you don't put out a case, we'll rule it to the President's defense. And by the way I think that's essential, I think the President needs a chance to defend himself.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I don't like this idea of this hanging out over him during an election. That would be kind of a strategy on the part of the Democrats albeit a weak one. So, how do you avoid that?\\n\\nJOHNSON: Or during a crisis in Iran.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\nJOHNSON: Laura, there has been so much damage already been done to this country--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Horrific.\\n\\nJOHNSON: Because of this. The fact that now any future president will have a hard time having a candid conversation with another world leader, because we've exposed these transcripts and of course within two weeks of this President taking office, conversations between world leaders were leaked. I don't know who President Trump can trust inside the administration. Think of that.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, he still has people on the National Security Council, detail staff who are working against his policies, burrowed in right now.\\n\\nThey are there.\\n\\nJOHNSON: You tailored the news stories came out after the missile attack against General Soleimani.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Soleimani.\\n\\nJOHNSON: And yes, there are still people leaking inside the administration, trying to undermine his policies.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Ben Carton (ph) said, you must hear this testimony from Bolton.\\n\\nHe had direct knowledge intimately involved in conversations with the President. And if you don't, then basically implying you're all part of a cover-up.\\n\\nJOHNSON: Well, if it was that crucial, why didn't the House go to court and try and get that testimony?\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They said, they didn't want to drag this out. They wanted to get this impeachment before Christmas, Senator.\\n\\nJOHNSON: And so now, she's holding out the articles of impeachment, it makes no sense whatsoever.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: So, you think in the Senate, this thing should be dealt with expeditiously and would you have an opportunity to appoint or ask for managers to come? Maybe, she didn't pick them.\\n\\nWhy can't someone else pick them?\\n\\nJOHNSON: I would just give her the opportunity. Your managers can show up at 1:00 on Tuesday, next Tuesday, and put on the case. We will give you 24 hours of floor time. If you don't show up, the president's team will be ready. We'll give his team 24 hours. And then we will decide what to do.\\n\\nMy guess is we've heard enough. It's such a weak case.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: How many votes do you need to change the rule?\\n\\nJOHNSON: Fifty-one. Fifty-one.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Only 51.\\n\\nJOHNSON: Yes.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I can't wait to see how this plays out. But it's too serious not to deal with expeditiously. Senator, thanks for coming in tonight. I really appreciate it.\\n\\nAnd speaking of impeachment, one House Democrat now suggesting that they add a new article -- killing a terrorist.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nREP. RO KHANNA, D-CALIF.: He would be, again, violating the Constitution by disregarding Congress. And it's illegal. It's, frankly, another impeachable offense for him to continue an escalation without Congress's authorization.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you suggesting that if the president did not abide by a resolution if it were to be passed by the House, by Congress, that you would potentially add that to articles of impeachment against him?\\n\\nKHANNA: It's definitely on the table. There is no greater offense, in my view, than sending American troops to war without congressional authorization.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Again, we keep saying we thought we'd heard it all. But here to respond, Doug Collins, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.\\n\\nCongressman, Democrats didn't seem to care when Obama was droning individual citizens abroad, including Americans, didn't ask for permission, didn't ask for consultation. It just happened. What is different?\\n\\nDOUG COLLINS, R-GA., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Nothing is different except Obama was president and now Trump. Mr. Trump is actually doing something that actually helps out country. What's offensive is Ro Khanna.\\n\\nLet's just be honest, here. Every time he opens his mouth it's not helpful to America. It's not helpful to anything.\\n\\nThey just came off an impeachment issue in the House, and I think what is actually happening is Nancy Pelosi is sitting here saying, oh, my God, this was so bad. This was actually worse than I thought it was, but I had to do it to appease my left. And now let me just hold it out here and play political. If I was one of her 31 members who were in Trump districts, and after she went up and got real solemn and said this is duty and our solemn, sworn --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Prayerful.\\n\\nCOLLINS: Prayerful. This really is our duty, and it's a conscience vote.\\n\\nAnd then within an hour you go out and use it as a political toy. Nancy Pelosi, she has no credibility, and Ro Khanna has less than her.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Cory Booker, one of the many Democrats speaking out about a supposed violation of the War Powers Act by the president in dealing with Soleimani. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is dangerous now to allow the president of the United States to grow in war powers, undermining those checks and balances, because you may have a sober, deliberative president like President Obama, but the next one could be an impulsive, capricious, un-strategic thinker like President Trump.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCOLLINS: Wow. Deliberative, this the President Obama who sat in the White House and allowed basically drones to attack anything that he wanted to and got complete immunity from the left, complete immunity from the Democrats.\\n\\nAnd now you have a president who took out a general who had blood on his hands? What do we say to somebody, what do we say to these troops having to go there? What do we say, this was said by my friend Mike Wallace, what do we say to those Gold Star families, what do we say to those who have been maimed, what do we say to those who Soleimani did to our country, and when we had a chance to take him out the president acted in very realist terms, as you said earlier. And we did it with purpose.\\n\\nHere's the problem, the War Powers Act is not covered under that. This is a president taking a self-defense action for our country, taking it directly to our enemy, taking it directly to someone who previous administrations said was a terrorist and was committing terrorist acts. He was not even supposed to be out of Iran. Think about this, under the old agreement, he was not even supposed to be traveling around like he was.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Iran was also boasting that it was gradually eroding any thought of really abiding by this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. Over the summer, they continued to talk, we're not going to be doing this. So we couldn't trust them, never could, despite Obama's idealistic, naive approach.\\n\\nCOLLINS: Laura, you just told me something amazing, that they actually attempted to keep this up. They never attempted to keep this up. The moment after it was signed, they were still traveling. Soleimani was traveling. They were still testing their weapons. They were still running the centrifuges. This was simply an appeasement by the Obama administration. The president had to clean it up. In this essence, he did. And what we've got also to think about now is Iraq is being run by Iran. This is what we have to understand.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Should we pull out of Iraq?\\n\\nCOLLINS: I think we have got a small footprint there. We're talking about to do exactly what we need to do. We don't need to be sending troops back in. What we need to do is be able to --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: He is sending more troops over there?\\n\\nCOLLINS: Well, I think he's sending in there to be -- again, what amazed me, when you had the Democrats said, oh, we have no plan for this. The president has a plan for this. He understands that there's going to be attacks. Again, what they don't like is here's a president being a president. This is what they have not seen in eight years. They saw an appeasing president. They saw a president who drew red lines in the sand and said oh, we might do this, but didn't do it. President Obama made promises he didn't keep. President Trump makes promises he keeps.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Prediction, will Nancy Pelosi send those articles of impeachment this week to the Senate?\\n\\nCOLLINS: I hope so. I think it's time to stop playing with this country.\\n\\nIt's time to stop playing with the voters of this country. It's time to stop playing in the destruction of democracy that they did in the House of Representatives. They broke every rule to get here. It's now time -- if you have such a strong case, then Adam Schiff, I think what they need to find is go after to the Wizard of Oz. They need to find the Wizard and find some courage. They need to find heart, because they've lost it complete. If they have a case, then make their case. If not, shut up.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Dismiss this thing, get it on for the country's sake. Congressman, great to see you.\\n\\nCOLLINS: Good to see you as well.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: First appearance in the new year by Collins.\\n\\nUp next, Trump has once again lured the left into defending what most of us think is indefensible. It doesn't stop them. Mollie Hemingway, Mike Huckabee are here, and they're going to tell us why liberals keep falling into this trap.\\n\\nAnd what do Golden Globes, that ridiculous awards ceremony, tell us about the next election, if anything? Stay tuned.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You remove Soleimani from the battlefield, but we have increased threats to Americans.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is a bad guy. He's gone now. But the point is, what is Trump's foreign policy? It's incoherent.\\n\\nREV. AL SHARPTON, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: No one is a sympathizer of the general. We are talking about the act, and we're talking about the fact that now we are upping the ante, talking about war crimes.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They're not even making any sense. Yes, he is a bad guy, but. If Ronald Reagan was the great communicator, Trump could be the great revealer. At every turn he is forcing Democrats to stumble all over their words, completely contradict what they said five minutes ago, and also the media, they are showing their true colors as well. In this case, they seem to be standing with Iran's sovereign right to exist to foment terror around the world.\\n\\nJoining me now, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, Fox News contributor, and Mike Huckabee, former GOP presidential candidate and Fox News contributor as well. Mollie, the president once again has the left all tied up in knots on this Soleimani thing. At the end of it you might as well thought he just worked at an NGO and was bandaging up poor animals who were caught in some horrible natural disaster by the way they're talking about him.\\n\\nMOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: It does seem that they're having trouble sticking with a particular narrative when it comes to Soleimani, Iran. First, they're telling us it's no big deal. Then they're highlighting the people who are mourning his death. They said that Trump doing this might have been a wag the dog effort to distract from impeachment. Last week supposedly he couldn't wait for impeachment, which is why Nancy Pelosi had such leverage. They can't stick with a particular storyline and it's making them looking like the only thing that they are consistent, and it is what they're consistent about, is opposition to Trump.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Governor Huckabee, when you think about how Trump has been an advocate for a more restrained approach to deployment of our military, and you I have talked about this, he's never gotten any credit for that from the left, not at all. But now they are mad that he is actually doing something to protect American interests against this craven mass murderer.\\n\\nMIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: He is not sending thousands of troops into ground combat, but he has taken on a mass murderer, a person who has not only killed over 700 Americans, but a person who has killed tens of thousands, we don't even know how many, of his own people in Iran.\\n\\nThis person is not a nice guy, and why anyone is defending him. It's only good reason for people of America to say do I really want to elect Democrats who hate Donald Trump even more than they detest a mass murderer?\\n\\nAnd the truth is, no, they just can't stand him. And they will side with Iranian government and all of its excesses of terror before they will appreciate this president.\\n\\nI just want to remind you, Laura, when Usama bin Laden was killed and Obama ordered it, I celebrated that publicly and on television, and I praised him and said I am glad the president made the decision. I think every Republican did. Why can't Democrats accept this? And I heard one of them the other day say it was the right thing to do but the wrong person did it.\\n\\nThat's how sick they are. That's sick.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, you can't even -- there's no words to describe a reaction like that.\\n\\nMollie, Barbara lee joined the Jayapal bandwagon with a tweet saying the following, People of Iranian descent including American citizens and Green Card holders are reportedly being detained by Customs and Border Patrol officials. We can't let this stand. Please contact my district office.\\n\\nIt gives her phone number. It turns out the CBP debunked this entire report. So this is like the -- there was a red scare. This is the Trump scare. Everything is an internment camp, basically.\\n\\nHEMINGWAY: And people really should be skeptical when they are told things. The previous two presidents had problems trusting intelligence that they shouldn't have trusted. You can never get mad at people for asking to the goods on intelligence or being skeptical that another president will embroil us in a war in the Middle East. But yes, you need to check your facts, and you need to not fall for conspiracy theories and whatnot. And that's not happening.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Governor, real quick, I had to get reaction to this latest leftist outrage. When the evangelicals laid hands on and they prayed over the president on Friday, some in the media reacted in total horror, calling it cult-like. But when church members lay hands on Biden to pray, it's an inspirational, moving moment. What does that tell us?\\n\\nHUCKABEE: It's just the absurdity of what we are dealing with. Some people eat their soup louder than others. It doesn't mean their soup tastes better. Some people are very expressive in their faith, others are very reserved. But the point is, if Donald Trump is a part of anything that is spiritual or the evangelicals are around him, it's cult-like. But if it happens with Biden, it's just a wonderful expression of an affirmation of a faith that he doesn't practice very well because he is supposedly to be a Catholic, but he's yet pro-abortion. That's a hard one to reconcile.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Mollie, real quick, do you think Nancy Pelosi sends the articles of impeachment to the Senate, yes or no?\\n\\nHEMINGWAY: I do think they'll get sent. I think that she tried her gambit. It totally failed. And she has no option but to send them.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Got to get it in the rearview at this point. Governor and Mollie, thanks so much.\\n\\nIf you missed the Golden Globes last night, there are a few moments that you have to recapture and revisit with Raymond Arroyo who will join us in a special appearance, never shows up on Mondays, next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: It's time for the Golden Globes with Raymond Arroyo. Host and comedian Ricky Gervais exposes Hollywood hypocrisy in the woke celebrities.\\n\\nThey all ignore his advice. Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo here with all details. All right, Raymond, I thought for a second you were going to wear a tuxedo and really embarrass yourself. But tell us about Ricky Gervais, liberal, Atheist, Trump-hating Ricky Gervais.\\n\\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I hate to tell you, I am wearing a tuxedo, but we'll get past that. He pulled no punches. Right out of the gate, Laura, Gervais said we are going to get laughs at Hollywood's expense, and then he offered them this warning.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nRICKY GERVAIS, COMEDIAN: If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You are no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nGERVAIS: So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your God and --\\n\\n(APPLAUSE)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: Laura, let me tell you, Gervais really stole the Golden Globes. He won the Golden Globes. Don't tell the folks at the L.A. Times that.\\n\\nTheir TV critic Lorraine Ali said he was disrespectful, disingenuous, and he could not read the room. My take is he was reading the living rooms across America. This is what people have been saying for years. They hate the politics at these award shows. And maybe these celebs should have heeded Gervais advice, Laura, but they didn't. Michelle Williams won a Golden Globe for playing Gwen Verdon on an FX show, but all she could talk about was not her career but how it was made possible by abortion.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wouldn't have been able to do this without employing a woman's right to choose, to when to have my children and with whom.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: She then encouraged women to rush to the voting booths this November, Laura, to protect abortion rights. Again, so out of touch. This is why, incidentally, the ratings have fallen, yet again, to an eight-year low for this broadcast.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Raymond, 17 years ago I wrote Shut Up and Sing. Shut up and sing, shut up and act, shut up and direct. It's 2003, I am glad Ricky Gervais has come along to my views. And what about Patricia Arquette. By the way, she blocked me on Twitter. I just found that out. She could not help getting political.\\n\\nARROYO: I saw that.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, she could not help getting political. She's now a foreign policy expert?\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not going to won't look back on this night in the history books. We will see a country on the brink of war. So while I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world. We have to vote in 2020 and we have beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: Laura, looking at Patricia Arquette, I'm reminded of something my wife Rebecca mentioned as we watched this. For all the talk of respecting women and the era of Me Too hanging over this awards ceremony, I think there was some confusion among certain actress about exactly what the Golden Globes referred to. There was more cleavage on that stage than the San Andreas fault, Laura. I could not believe some of these outfits.\\n\\nThroughout the ceremony it seemed the outfits got worse and worse. Like Frederick's of Hollywood were dressing these women. It was really an outrageous, I have to say. The whole evening got worse and worse.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Now, Raymond, first of all, you wrote a great piece on the Golden Globes at FOXnews.com, which everybody should check out. But from beginning to end, other than Gervais, it was one incomprehensible moment after another. And Joaquin Phoenix, God bless him, he's a great actor, but what was he even saying?\\n\\nARROYO: They were talking about, by the way, Laura, the Australian fires. They just arrested 12 people in Australia for those fires. They were blaming it on climate change. Wrong again.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Raymond, fantastic analysis. We've got to go, and we'll be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are a lot of Australians in the room tonight, and I know we are all very grateful for the call outs to our fellow compatriots who are suffering.\\n\\nWhen one country faces a climate disaster, we all face of climate disaster.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, as Raymond noted, there are reports tonight out of Australia that it was arson, perhaps not climate change. Well, they have arrested many people who apparently have been found with accelerants and other arson-related material.\\n\\nWe'll bring you updates on that. And it's raining. Four days of rain expected in key parts of Australia. That's great news.\\n\\nNow, that's all the time we have tonight. It's good to be back. Shannon Bream and the Fox News @ Night team take it all from here.\\n\\nShannon, I intruded on your hour, and I apologize greatly. I just -- I blew the clock. It's my fault.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

{"original": "**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.**\\n\\n\\n\\nPRESENTING YOUR 2020 ROSTER\\n\\nThere are a lot of reasons that we love baseball. But one of the best things about America's pastime is that the season is long.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhichever team you like is today in contention for the World Series. We are still six weeks from the start of spring training, but it will still be true in May and, for most of the teams, all the way until the All Star break, halfway through the season.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Democratic nominating process for 2020 is going to be a great deal like that.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou will find below our first list of contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. There are 35 individuals who have at least expressed interest in running. Some have already filed papers, some have set deadlines for themselves, while others seem more likely to be just musing in the media.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don't care… yet. For now, you just need to be a person who can credibly campaign and at least be considering a run.\\n\\n\\n\\nEven with those relatively permissive standards, 35 people is a huge field. It is a result of not only a pretty considerable amount of talent on the Democratic bench but also the fact that the Democrats believe President Trump is eminently beatable in 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe incumbent's current condition – fighting with his own party over foreign policy, presiding over a government shutdown and still smarting from the spanking he took in 2018 – leads Democrats to think that almost anybody would have a chance in 2020.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe think Democrats generally are underestimating the potential for Trump's re-election. But there's no denying that the party's nomination is viewed as a prize of great value.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe names you see listed below are grouped here by their offices or careers. This is only useful here in the very early going when we are still five months away from the first debate. As we progress, new lanes and groupings will emerge based on the ideologies, personal traits, electoral strategy and attitudes of the candidates. But for now, job description will be enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis list is very much subject to change as candidates drop in, drop out, or otherwise disqualify themselves. But at the beginning of this long season, here's your starting roster:\\n\\n\\n\\nOBAMA CABINET\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden - Former Attorney General Eric Holder - Former Secretary of State John Kerry - Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is already enormous nostalgia among Democrats for the Obama presidency and that is only going to increase. While Democrats may have grumbled about Obama's lack of fire or ineffectiveness, almost all of his initial luster has been restored by the mellowing effects of memory.\\n\\n\\n\\nBiden or another of Obama's acolytes may find success running as James Polk did in 1844, which was to seal and complete the vision of a past hero of the party. Andrew Jackson may have led the revolution that changed American politics, but it was Polk who cemented those gains in the most material ways.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don't know what an Obama Democrat really is since his rise was a singular phenomenon rather than a movement. It may be only now, without the presence of his longtime rival, Hillary Clinton, that the Democrats get down to defining what that means.\\n\\n\\n\\nGOVERNORS\\n\\nFormer Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper - Washington Governor Jay Inslee - Montana Governor Steve Bullock - Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe - Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley\\n\\n\\n\\nConventional wisdom holds that Republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are Democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. Yes, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 Republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. Of the 15 Democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, were former governors.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaybe it was just because Republicans nominated Thomas Dewey so often that it seemed like more…\\n\\n\\n\\nThat being said, any of the governors on this list would have to win as dark horse candidates. Hickenlooper, a moderate and successful businessman, has been nosing around a run longer than the rest, but is still a relative unknown inside his party.\\n\\n\\n\\nInslee is even less well known but does have an angle: If he runs it will be as the climate change candidate in the race. That would speak to a considerable portion of the Democratic electorate.\\n\\n\\n\\nSENATORS\\n\\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders - Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren - California Senator Kamala Harris - New Jersey Senator Cory Booker - Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar - Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown - Colorado Senator Michael Bennet - New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand - Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley - Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey - Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know the old Washington joke: What do all 100 members of the Senate see every morning when they look in the mirror? The next president of the United States.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's crazy to think that 11 sitting senators will all compete for the Democratic nomination, and that's because it's not going to happen. You sometimes get the sense with senators that they say they're interested because it would be too embarrassing to say otherwise. If everybody else has an exploratory committee, why not you?\\n\\n\\n\\nEven so, there will be at least four serious contenders in the Senate that will make life much harder for Sen. Chuck Schumer as he tries to overcome his members' personal ambition for the good of the party overall.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt seems pretty clear that 2016 runner-up Sanders will be plowing the same ground as Warren who is doing her best to simulate gusto in her now-official candidacy.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it seems for Harris and Booker, as well. The two of them were already jousting during the televised spectacle of the most recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings, trying to be the most woke and most brutal in their performances. Harris got the better of Booker then and, we expect, will be in good position to do so again.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe is particularly helped by the emergence of her home state as an early primary. California Democrats will go to the polls on March 3rd as opposed to June, their traditional primary month. That puts the largest trove of Democratic delegates up for grabs four weeks after the Iowa Caucuses. If you can't play in California this time around, you can't play at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nREPRESENTATIVES\\n\\nTexas Representative Beto O'Rourke - Ohio Representative Tim Ryan - Former Maryland Representative John Delaney - California Representative Eric Swalwell - Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's safe to say that House members don't have a great track record in presidential campaigns. Only two members of the House who never attained higher office have won the presidency: James Garfield and Abraham Lincoln.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo maybe what they lack in number is compensated for by quality. But it's certainly not the typical path.\\n\\n\\n\\nGiven the decreasing emphasis on candidate qualifications and the increasing ability for campaigns to speak directly to voters on a national scale, however, this could be the cycle. Certainly, O'Rourke's strong second in bright-red Texas gives him something to talk about.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for the others, they better find a way to get famous pretty quick.\\n\\n\\n\\nMAYORS\\n\\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg - Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti - Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu - South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg\\n\\n\\n\\nNever in American history has anyone gone directly from the mayor's office to the White House. But then again, America never had a reality show host win the presidency before.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat conundrum will confront Democratic kingmakers again and again as they try to whittle down this massive field. If Trump, who had no experience in public service, can win why not someone with a lengthy background even if it's not on a national level?\\n\\n\\n\\nBloomberg seems to be the only one who can make an argument for top-tier status thanks to his famous name, ability to fund his own campaign and track record as an advocate for gun control. As a party switcher and mega-rich white dude he will have a long way to go to answer concerns from Democratic loyalists, but if he's serious about running after a decade of false starts, he could be a contender.\\n\\n\\n\\nBILLIONAIRES\\n\\nHedge fund manager Tom Steyer - Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the Trump administration is the beginning of a real oligarchy in the American presidency, Democrats don't want to miss the boat. They have two potential candidates with zero record of accomplishment in public service but lots and lots and lots of money.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Schultz's efforts so far have looked more like an identity crisis than a real candidacy, Steyer is a serious player. He spent much of the past two years generating a list of potential supporters through an impeachment petition he lavishly advertised on television. He also established credibility with liberal activists by funding insurgent candidates like Andrew Gillum in Florida.\\n\\n\\n\\nSteyer's longstanding efforts on climate change help, too. Whether that's enough to overcome Democratic aversion to nominating a white, Episcopalian hedge fund manager we don't know.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOULD BE\\n\\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama - Former New York Senator Hillary Clinton - Media mogul Oprah Winfrey - Actor Dwayne The Rock Johnson\\n\\n\\n\\nWe know, we know… They've said they're not running or at least tried to pour cold water on such speculation. We also know, however, these folks have big enough names, deep enough pockets and strong enough support among Democratic primary voters that they could still do it if they wanted to.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese could be candidates are limited to those who could make the run without a lengthy warm up. Every candidate likes to imagine that they could skip the coming 12-month endurance challenge, but only name brands could really do that.\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.

Trump has also been removed from other social media platforms, including Facebook, Reddit and Instagram\\n\\nI think the fact that all these companies have made the moves to ban Trump proves that they now realize they are responsible for the content and now it's time to talk about Section 230, Toscano said.\\n\\nSection 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. The section has been pivotal in the rise of today's social media giants by allowing not only Internet service providers –­ but also Google, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and others –­ to be shielded from liability from content posted on their platforms by third parties, in most cases.\\n\\nTWITTER SUSPENDS @REALDONALDTRUMP ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY\\n\\nCritics have long felt the tech giants should no longer benefit from the protections of Section 230 and Toscano thinks the decisio to de-platform Trump is clear evidence changes need to be made.\\n\\nI think now we have proof that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, all these companies in making this move, feel that they are responsible for the content on their platform, which then drives the conversation into Section 230, Toscano said. That's the whole argument of Section 230, right? They all argue that they shouldn't be held accountable for the content on their platform. Well, they just made a huge statement that they do feel accountable.\\n\\nToscano founded the Better Ethics and Consumer Outcomes Network, also known as BEACON. The group hopes to create a better future through technology and bills itself as a social innovation organization that operates at the intersection of human-centered design, social impact, and public policy.\\n\\nI do believe this will be the beginning of the downfall of social media as we know it, Toscano said. I don't think social media is going away, I think what's going to happen is between this stuff which will get us deep into Section 230, the antitrust cases and all this other litigation being brought up against Big Tech, I do think we are going to see the downfall of these companies. There is a giant net being cast over these companies that is going to drag them down.\\n\\nTWITTER SLAMMED FOR NOT ACTING ON CHINESE MEDIA TWEET ALLEGING COVID-19 CAME FROM 'IMPORTED FROZEN FOOD'\\n\\nTrump's ban from Twitter appeared to be part of what many have referred to as a purge of the social media giant's users, including former pro-Trump attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, as well as former National Security Adviser Gen. Michael Flynn. Toscano sees the purge as the company finally holding itself accountable and proof they shouldn't be shielded by Section 230.\\n\\nI think that Section 230 has needed to be changed for quite some time, I think it's not appropriate for the current state of the Internet. Back in the 1990s when it was put into place, it was written that way to enable innovation, which it did, Toscano said. I think we've just reached the point… no one is accountable and now it's time for us to change some of those rules in order to make sure people are held accountable.\\n\\nEX-GOOGLE CONSULTANT SOUNDS ALARM ON NEGATIVE IMPACT OF BIG TECH IN 'THE SOCIAL DILEMMA'\\n\\nToscano isn't sure if the companies will completely vanish or simply lose prominence, but is confident the future of technology will look quite different.\\n\\nMy biggest bet is that platforms like Facebook and Twitter, maybe even YouTube, they are not built for a world [with] a different Section 230. They're not built for that and I think by the time that they realize that it is a strategic business initiative that they need to take on, it will be too late, Toscano said. There are thousands of people trying to create the next social media [platform] right now… I think what's going to happen is, a new platform will pop up that is built around accountability and proper ways to manage free speech and these platforms that are now in the direction of censorship, because they've set that precedent for themselves, I think they're gonna start to crumble.\\n\\nHe predicted that a company will eventually leapfrog Facebook the same way Facebook did to MySpace and simply create a better product that coincides with modern times.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Toscano feels Twitter did the right thing, even if it ends up being the downfall of social media as we know it.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIt really comes down to terms of service, Toscano said. If any of us, individually, did the stuff that Trump has done, we would also be banned. It's an agreement that we all made when we signed up for the platform. Are those rules overbearing? Do they need to be critiqued and changed in the future? Possibly. That's more of a Section 230 conversation… we need to have a bigger conversation, as a society, about whether that's right that a company that large has this much power over the government.\\n\\nThe Social Dilemma features several Silicon Valley insiders – including Toscano -- explaining the dark side of social media, with everyone from the co-inventor of Facebook's like button to high-powered executives weighing in."}
{"original": "The Trump administration is working to score what it hopes to be another foreign policy win, this time by encouraging leaders from Serbia and Kosovo to sign a peace agreement in a ceremony that could take place at the White House.\\n\\nA source confirmed to Fox News a report that Kosovo President Hashim Thaci recently traveled to Germany and met with U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell to discuss a deal that would lower tariffs on Serb goods, and in general lead to a lessening of tensions. Problems between Kosovo and Serbia – a longtime issue - have recently become so tense that some fear armed conflict may break out.\\n\\nPresident Trump gave both Kosovo and Serbia a clear path towards getting greater U.S. support, a U.S. official told Fox News. He wants them to come up with a mutually agreed upon solution. As long as they both agree, then he will support it. Unlike the European position, everything is on the table for the U.S.\\n\\nUneasy relations between Serbia and its former province have simmered since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, nine years after a NATO-led military campaign led drove the Serbs from Kosovo. The NATO action came after a Serbian ethnic cleansing campaign drove hundreds of thousands of Kosovars to neighboring countries, and threatened to engulf the states of the foreign Yugoslavia into war.\\n\\nThaci's meeting with Grenell, who as a former spokesperson for the U.S. delegation to the U.N. and foreign policy expert is intimately familiar with the Kosovo-Serb situation, helped raise the profile of the issue. Grennell is regarded a Trump confidante in Europe who has very effective access to the White House.\\n\\nTrump recently sent letters to both Thaci and Serb President Aleksandar Vucic, asking they accelerate negotiations in an effort to resolve their impasse. As first reported in the Washington Post, Thaci and Vucic published their versions of the Trump letter online.\\n\\nFailure to capi­tal­ize on this unique opportunity would be a tragic setback, as another chance for a comprehensive peace is unlikely to occur again soon, Trump wrote to the Kosovar leader.\\n\\nIn a statement to the Post, Grenell said he and Thaci spoke about the importance of making long-term decisions instead of reacting in the short term. I was pleased that he agreed, and committed to work to end the tariffs that were recently imposed on Serbian products, Grenell said in a statement to The Post. This move would help send the right signals that he is serious about negotiating and help build trust between the parties.\\n\\nBringing the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia together for a White House ceremony would be seen as a major accomplishment. The deep-seated animosity between the Serbs and Kosovars, who are ethnic Albanians and are predominately Muslim, stretches back centuries.\\n\\nOne expert welcomed the increased U.S. attention on the Kosovo-Serbia issue, particularly in the context of the larger Balkans framework.\\n\\nThe rising tensions between Serbia and Kosovo -- and the way in which Serbia and Russia are working together to foment instability in neighboring Bosnia - pose a real threat to regional peace, said Daniel Baer, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and advisor to Foreign Policy for America.\\n\\nObviously, offering the White House as a setting is offering a big carrot, but if the administration can use that carrot to achieve a genuine peace between Serbia and Kosovo, including recognition of Kosovo by Belgrade, that would be a significant step forward."}
{"original": "One U.S. attribute that distinguishes the current Middle East conflict from past ones is the country's energy independence. Last September, U.S. petroleum product exports exceeded imports for the first time in recorded history. The Energy Information Agency expects net exports of total crude oil and petroleum to average 570,000 barrels per day in 2020. Energy independence means that the U.S. has no vital economic interests in the Middle East -- a marked change from past conflicts where the country was dependent on a steady flow of Mideast oil to lubricate the domestic economy. This energy security gives the Trump administration more leeway in its foreign policy approach. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil, said President Trump in remarks to the nation on Wednesday.\\n\\nTHE 2020 OIL RISK NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT Consider: In the aftermath of the U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the price of oil has only increased by a few percent. Contrast this to past conflicts such as the Iraq wars and the Arab oil embargo of 1973, when the oil price skyrocketed. Turmoil in the Middle East no longer threatens the U.S. energy supply. The U.S. now produces and consumes about 20 million barrels of petroleum products a day. Crude oil production has more than doubled over the last decade as the American fracking revolution and good government policy have combined to create countless gushers. The U.S. is now the world's biggest oil producer. Net petroleum imports have fallen from 10 million barrels a day in 2010 -- about 50 percent of consumption -- to zero.\\n\\nEnergy independence means that the U.S. has no vital economic interests in the Middle East -- a marked change from past conflicts where the country was dependent on a steady flow of Mideast oil to lubricate the domestic economy.\\n\\nOil independence was a fantasy as recently as a decade ago, when the experts were warning of peak oil. In 2011, former President Barack Obama said, The United States of America cannot afford to bet our long-term prosperity, our long-term security, on a resource [oil] that will eventually run out. The biggest benefits of energy independence, however, are economic. The U.S. energy production bonanza is responsible for significantly reducing energy prices, with the price of oil falling by about one third over the last decade, adjusted for inflation. At the most basic level, lower energy prices mean better economic prospects for ordinary Americans and small businesses.\\n\\nISRAEL BEGINS PUMPING FROM LUCRATIVE MEDITERRANEAN GAS FIELD Lower oil prices cause lower gas prices, which put more money in the pockets of families and consumers. According to economist Stephen Moore, a Job Creators Network board member, every one-cent drop in gas prices puts more than $1 billion a year into the hands of Americans. With gas prices down around $1 to $1.50 since the fracking revolution, Americans have enjoyed the equivalent of a $100 to $150 billion a year economic stimulus.\\n\\nAmericans also benefit from lower energy costs beyond just the price of gas. Economists suggest that for energy to be considered affordable, it must cost less than six percent of household income. Lower energy costs mean less energy poverty for Americans on fixed incomes. Contrast this energy wealth to the situation in other industrialized nations such as Great Britain, where thousands of pensioners die each winter because they cannot afford to adequately heat their homes. Oil is an input cost on all goods, whether it is used directly in the production process as in the case of plastics or indirectly through transport costs such as with Florida oranges. Lower costs of basic goods help keep inflation low which disproportionately benefits price-sensitive shoppers.\\n\\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Lower energy costs are a major boon for small businesses, which use far more energy than ordinary families. High energy costs act as a tax on operations, reducing the available income to hire, raise wages, and expand. Especially for energy-intensive businesses such as manufacturers, low U.S. energy prices offer a competitive advantage over foreign competitors. Unfortunately, Democratic presidential candidates want to raise the cost of energy for ordinary Americans and small businesses by passing new regulations and taxes on traditional uses. For instance, every candidate wants to ban or severely curtail fracking. This would return the country to a position of economic dependence on Middle Eastern nations.\\n\\nEnergy independence fuels national and economic security. It's just another example of how the American free-market economic system keeps us safer.\\n\\nAlfredo Ortiz is President and CEO of the Job Creators Network, a non-partisan organization founded by entrepreneurs.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS"}

My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth,\\n\\norderly, and seamless transition of power.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: We'll discuss the final turbulent days of the Trump presidency\\n\\nwith former White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who resigned from an\\n\\nadministration post this week. And the possibility of a second impeachment\\n\\nwith House Majority Whip James Clyburn.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlus, Twitter bans President Trump from its platform, saying his recent\\n\\ntweets glorified violence. We'll ask our Sunday panel about the power of\\n\\nbig tech to restrict free speech.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll, right now, on FOX News Sunday.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE (on camera): And hello again from FOX News in Washington.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a week that has shaken the nation's capital to its core, a week\\n\\nthat brought a direct assault on our democracy. We saw the president of the\\n\\nUnited States urged tens of thousands of people not to accept the results\\n\\nof the election, to march on Congress and demand they stop the steal.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw senators, self-proclaimed adherence to the text of the Constitution,\\n\\nignore the 155 million Americans who voted and say Congress should decide\\n\\nwho the next president is.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw a mob of insurrectionist storm the capital, lay waste to the offices\\n\\nof elected leaders, invade the Senate chamber, and even sit in the chair\\n\\nthe vice president occupied moments before. And now this -- we saw a non-\\n\\nscalable 7-foot fence go up around the capitol grounds. For all the talk\\n\\nabout the barrier on our southern border, this is the wall many will\\n\\nremember is the true mark of Donald Trump's presidency.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis hour, we'll discuss it all -- the resignations, the calls to remove\\n\\nthe president, and the search to find some way to put the pieces of our\\n\\ngovernment back together.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a moment, we'll speak with former White House Chief of Staff Mick\\n\\nMulvaney and House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut first, let's turn to David Spunt at the White House with the latest on\\n\\ndemands for the president to step down or be forced out -- David.\\n\\n\\n\\nDAVID SPUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, there was a very real\\n\\npossibility Donald Trump could become the first president in American\\n\\nhistory to be impeached twice. It just takes the majority of the House to\\n\\ndo so and Democrats are chomping at the bit.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nTRUMP: I want to thank you all.\\n\\n\\n\\nSPUNT (voice-over): Minutes after President Trump spoke to the crowd,\\n\\nmelee inside and outside of the United States Capitol. Five people,\\n\\nincluding a Capitol police officer, died.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump administration officials continue to submit resignations, including\\n\\ncabinet secretaries Elaine Chao and Betsy DeVos.\\n\\n\\n\\nA second impeachment could happen in just days.\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER: We don't need a lengthy\\n\\ndebate. The president's abuse of power, his incitement of a mob against a\\n\\nduly elected representative body of the United States is a manifestly\\n\\nimpeachable offense.\\n\\n\\n\\nSPUNT: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says she will move forward with\\n\\nimpeachment if Vice President Mike Pence decides against invoking the 25th\\n\\nAmendment and the president refuses to resign. If the House impeaches,\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the Senate won't get involved\\n\\nuntil January 19th at the soonest, the day before Trump leaves office.\\n\\n\\n\\nSome Republicans don't want to wait.\\n\\n\\n\\nI want him to resign, I want him out. He has caused enough damage, Alaska\\n\\nRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski told her hometown newspaper.\\n\\n\\n\\nLate Friday, Twitter bans the president's accounts permanently. A Twitter\\n\\nspokesperson says his tweets incited violence.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nSPUNT (on camera): I'm told Vice President Pence will attend President-\\n\\nelect Joe Biden's inauguration on January 20th. President Trump said he\\n\\nwill not -- making him the first president to skip an inauguration since\\n\\nAndrew Johnson did so to General Ulysses Grant in 1869 -- Chris.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: David Spunt reporting from the White House -- David, thank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd joining us now, Mick Mulvaney, President Trump's former chief of staff\\n\\nwho resigned this week as the administration's special envoy to Northern\\n\\nIreland.\\n\\n\\n\\nMick, after all of the controversial things that Donald Trump did over the\\n\\nlast four years, why was this week the final straw? Why now, say, that you\\n\\ncould no longer be part of his administration?\\n\\n\\n\\nMICK MULVANEY, FORMER TRUMP CHIEF OF STAFF: Chris, good morning. Thanks\\n\\nfor having me. I think everybody recognizes that what happened on Wednesday\\n\\nis different. You can go down the long litany of things that people\\n\\ncomplained about with Donald Trump. And I could probably defend almost all\\n\\nof them. Many of them were policy differences, many of them were stylistic\\n\\ndifferences. But Wednesday was different. Wednesday was existential.\\n\\nWednesday is one of those things that struck to the very heart of what it\\n\\nmeans to be an American.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it was wrong. And I think it was important for those of us who used to\\n\\nbe on the inner circle. I mean, look, you and I have been doing this for\\n\\nyears. I came in in 2010, you know, the Tea Party. I started the Freedom\\n\\nCaucus with Mark Meadows. I was in the cabinet. I was the chief of staff. I\\n\\nthought it was important for somebody who is not establishment, who is not\\n\\na Trump -- a never-Trumper to come out and say that, that was wrong. It\\n\\nneeds to be said again and again and again by as many people as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Should President Trump be removed from office in these final 10\\n\\ndays? If you were a member of the cabinet, would you vote to invoke the\\n\\n25th Amendment? If you were still a member of Congress, would you vote to\\n\\nimpeach?\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Yes, I think the 25th Amendment is a very clumsy tool. We've\\n\\nnever used it under these circumstances. We typically used it when a\\n\\npresident goes for a medical procedure. We don't really know how to do it.\\n\\nAnd it's slow. It's not unusual we're talking about it. Again, this was\\n\\nsuch an extreme event on Wednesday it's not surprising we're looking at\\n\\nextreme possible reactions to what happened on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\nRegarding impeachment, I think it depends. I know the Democrats are going\\n\\nto introduce articles of impeachment on Monday. If it's just related to\\n\\nWednesday, that's one thing. If it's the type of impeachment that just\\n\\nbecomes a list of complaints of why they don't like Donald Trump, that's\\n\\nsomething else. But I think it's different now than the impeachment was\\n\\nlast year.\\n\\n\\n\\nLast year the impeachment was a witch hunt. It was a political thing. They\\n\\nwere looking for an excuse to impeach the president forever. Now it's\\n\\ndifferent and I think it will be looked at very differently by members of\\n\\nboth the House and the Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: So directly, if you were still a member of Congress and it was\\n\\nimpeachment for incitement to violence, which is what this article of\\n\\nimpeachment is, specifically over the events this last week, would you vote\\n\\nto impeach this president?\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Yes, (INAUDIBLE) sort of sit here and say yes or no, but I would\\n\\ntake it really, really seriously, Chris. I'm not trying to dodge your\\n\\nquestion. But that's probably the most serious question you can ask any\\n\\nmember of Congress. And to sort of give a flip answer based on sitting here\\n\\ntalking about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou want to sit down, you want to hear the arguments, want to parse out the\\n\\nspeeches that the president made, that his son made, that Rudy Giuliani\\n\\nmade. Look at what actually happened that day, look at what happened during\\n\\nthe day. What did the president say while it was going on, what did the\\n\\npresident say afterwards. All of that would be evidence that needs to be\\n\\ntaken into consideration.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I can assure you, there will be members of both parties who look at it\\n\\nvery differently than they did last year in the previous impeachment.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Mick, when you announced your resignation this week, you said\\n\\nthat you felt, quote, embarrassment and shame. Do you feel any\\n\\nresponsibility -- you were chief of staff for more than a year -- do you\\n\\nfeel any responsibility for Donald Trump?\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: I feel a emotions this week. I was shocked, I was angered, I was\\n\\nsad, I was embarrassed, I was frustrated. And I still am trying to figure\\n\\nout what I could have done differently, if anything. I've been out of the\\n\\nWhite House now for eight months.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat I do know, Chris, is there are things that are different. When we saw\\n\\nthe president -- I wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal six weeks ago\\n\\nsaying that I thought the president would leave in a presidential manner. I\\n\\nreally did believe that at the time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe stories I told to back that up were true.\\n\\n\\n\\nI've seen the president be presidential before and I know that he has the\\n\\nability to do it, he did it every single day. I don't know what's\\n\\ndifferent; if it's different now, if it's different about his advisors.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe used to love vigorous debate from all sides of a particular issue. I\\n\\ndon't know if he still has that in the White House. I don't know if now\\n\\nhe's surrounded himself with people like Rudy Giuliani and Peter Navarro\\n\\nthat simply tell him what he wants to hear and reaffirm exactly what they\\n\\nthink he wants them to say.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's a very dangerous position for any president to be in. I think the\\n\\npresident, either he's different, the people around him are different or\\n\\nboth, but something is very different now that we saw when I worked there\\n\\nmore than eight months ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Mick, respectfully, there are people who say he isn't different,\\n\\nthis is the Donald Trump you worked for. (Inaudible) John Kelly who was\\n\\nyour predecessor as White House chief of staff says he gave this advice to\\n\\nthe president when he left in December of 2018. Take a look.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nJOHN KELLY, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF (Voice Over): I said please don't hire a\\n\\nboot licker or a yes man because you will be impeached. And towards the end\\n\\nof my time there, all I ever heard from some of the real devotees in the\\n\\nWhite House was you got to let Trump be Trump, let Trump be Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOCLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Kelly says specifically that you and others didn't have the spine\\n\\nto tell the president, no.\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: That's not true and I'm sorry to hear John say that -- not going\\n\\nto pick a fight with John Kelly. The advice is good advice, not to surround\\n\\nyourself with yes men.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook, we saw the president be presidential. I remember circumstances --\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: But he says you were one of the yes men, Mick.\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: No, that -- well, he's just -- listen, John should know more\\n\\nthan anyone else that what happens when the doors close in the Oval Office\\n\\nis not the stuff you see on TV. It's easy now, Chris, for people who don't\\n\\nlike the president, who never liked the president, who always thought the\\n\\npresident was a monster, wanted him to be that. People who saw them through\\n\\nthe filter of the media to say, oh, look, we told you so, we knew it was\\n\\nalways going to be like this.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut those of us who worked with him every single day knew that the exact\\n\\nopposite was true. Knew that he was into the policy, he was excited about\\n\\nwhat we had done for the country. Unemployment was down, we didn't have any\\n\\nnew foreign wars; we had a lot of successes to point to despite all of\\n\\nthose sort of stylistic things that people like John Kelly just really\\n\\ndidn't like.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut we had those successes and we were very proud of the work that we were\\n\\ndoing, very proud of letting the president be the president because he was\\n\\nelected as the president. But again, all of that changed --\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: But -- but --\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: -- on Wednesday. And I don't know why.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: But again, Mick, a lot of people say it didn't change on\\n\\nWednesday. Kelly was right. The president was impeached when you were Chief\\n\\nof Staff for cutting of aid to Ukraine, allegedly, unless they dug up dirt\\n\\non Joe Biden. And here you were at that time defending the president. Take\\n\\na look.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nUNKNOWN: This is (inaudible) is a quid pro quo. It is funding will not flow\\n\\nunless the investigation is in (ph) -- if a Democratic server (ph) happened\\n\\nas well.\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: We do that all the time with foreign policy.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOCLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Whether the president should have been impeached or not, I don't\\n\\nwant to get into that argument, why didn't you resign over that?\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Because I simply misspoke. And I've had that conversation with\\n\\nJohn Koe (ph) who was the gentlemen asking that question. A friend of mine\\n\\nmany, many times. But it's actually really a --\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: I'm not talking about --\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: -- good example --\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: I'm not talking about your statement, Mick. I'm talking about why\\n\\nnot resign over what I'm -- I know you don't think was a proper thing for\\n\\nthe president to do, cut off aid to Ukraine --\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: No, no. No, no. Chris --\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: -- digging up dirt on Joe Biden.\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: No, no, no. But, Chris -- no, no. (Inaudible). That original\\n\\nimpeachment -- and I don't (ph) realize we were going to get into this\\n\\ntoday, had absolutely nothing to do with anything that was actually wrong.\\n\\nIt was the Democrats looking for an excuse and they found one line in a\\n\\ntranscript with Zelensky saying, do us a favor, that allowed them -- gave\\n\\nthem the political excuse they needed to do an impeachment.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe all know, or at least many of us know and expect that that was -- that\\n\\nwas an impeachment looking for an excuse. It was a political event. It was\\n\\na show trial. And, again, I don't want to get into this too heavily today.\\n\\nBut that has nothing to do with what we're --\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: OK.\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: -- doing today. The reason I didn't -- the reason I didn't resign\\n\\nright then (ph) is the president did nothing wrong. The president did\\n\\nnothing wrong back then.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, OK. Let me --\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Nothing (ph) --\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Let me ask you about some other things. You were a top member of\\n\\nthe administration when the president defended the White supremacists at\\n\\nCharlottesville. You were a top (ph) member of the administration, not\\n\\nChief of Staff, when the Trump administration separated parents coming\\n\\nacross the border from their children.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy not resign over those?\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Because it -- the -- I remember the kids in cages thing, which\\n\\nwas -- which a lot of folks gave a lot of attention to and we seem to have\\n\\nforgotten, including you Chris, that those pictures -- many of the pictures\\n\\nof the kids in cages were taken during the Obama administration. They were\\n\\nObama caged --\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Nothing --\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: -- nothing like with (ph) the policy under Donald Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Chris, these are policy differences, OK? These are things that\\n\\nyou think the country should look one way, we think it should look another.\\n\\nThese are differences of style, the way the president speaks. Did he\\n\\nmisspeak at Charlottesville? Yes. Should he have corrected it? Yes. Did he\\n\\nhandle it poorly? Yes. But it was not something that people resign over.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you talk as a living, as you and I do, you're going to misspeak from\\n\\ntime to time. It's inevitable. Those are not the type of things to give\\n\\nrise to resignations. In fact, I don't think anybody including John Kelly\\n\\nresigned during any of those. As I recall, John Kelly got fired and didn't\\n\\nresign.\\n\\n\\n\\nWednesday was different. And I hope that we focus on why Wednesday was\\n\\ndifferent than something about a policy over immigration or a policy on how\\n\\nto handle this or that. This is different and I think it's important that\\n\\npeople recognize the differentiations between differences of policy and\\n\\nwhat happened on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Finally, on November 7th, you pointed this out and I want to -- I\\n\\nwant to ask you specifically about it. On November 7th, four days after the\\n\\nelection, as you point out, you wrote an article for The Wall Street\\n\\nJournal. I want to put some of it up.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou said, the U.S. needs to know that the winner is actually the winner.\\n\\nAnd once Americans know that, I have every expectation that Mr. Trump will\\n\\nbe, act, and speak like a great president should, win or lose.\\n\\n\\n\\nMick, how could someone who worked with the president so closely for three\\n\\nyears be so wrong about who Donald Trump was?\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Then clearly, something is different now than it was when you saw\\n\\nit.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wrote that article for a reason, because I've seen the examples. I think\\n\\nif you read the piece, I give a couple of examples. In there, I told (ph),\\n\\nthis one is another example that I've never talked about publicly, which is\\n\\nthat during the impeachment, the president tweeted something during the\\n\\ntestimony and there was concern that it might rise to level of tampering\\n\\nwith witnesses.\\n\\n\\n\\nI know a little bit about the law. I practiced law a long time ago. It\\n\\nwasn't that, but I was worried about the political impact of that.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, I went to the president, privately, said, Mr. President, there's going\\n\\nto be a political problem. We need to fix this.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe looked at me, and said, OK, brought the lawyers down, talked to them,\\n\\npicked up the phone, called Kevin McCarthy. Brought Ivanka in, talked to\\n\\nthem, talked to some of his friends in New York. Got a bunch of different\\n\\nopinions, and then fixed it, reversed course and did the right thing.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat was the president that we saw time and again. You saw him through the\\n\\nmedia, you saw him the light that you wanted to see him.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe saw the real President Trump who had that ability to pivot when he knew\\n\\nsomething had gone off the rails.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat didn't happen on Wednesday. It hasn't much since the election, and\\n\\nthat's what I think the difference is and that's why I got that piece so\\n\\nwrong six weeks ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Mick, thank you. Thanks for your time. Always good to talk with\\n\\nyou, sir.\\n\\n\\n\\nMULVANEY: Thanks, Chris.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Up next, House Speaker Pelosi moves to impeach President Trump\\n\\nfor the second time. We'll ask Majority Whip Jim Clyburn about that, next.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: House Democrats have drafted a new article of impeachment against\\n\\nPresident Trump, if members of the Trump cabinet do not take action to\\n\\nremove him. The resolution could be introduced as soon as tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoining us now, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, Congressman, welcome back to FOX News Sunday.\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. JIM CLYBURN (D-SC), HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP: Thank you very much for\\n\\nhaving me.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Have Speaker Pelosi and you and the Democratic leadership -- have\\n\\nyou made a firm, final decision whether or not to vote on impeachment of\\n\\nPresident Trump this week?\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: I think so. I think that will come probably Tuesday and maybe\\n\\nWednesday, but it will happen this week. The articles have been drawn up.\\n\\nJamie Raskin and the leadership have been working very hard to make sure\\n\\nthat it is exactly what is required to demonstrate to the Senate, well,\\n\\nmaybe the House first, that this president has rendered himself duly\\n\\nunqualified to be president.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Congressman, if the House does vote to impeach, will you hold off\\n\\ndelay sending it over to the Senate until those two Democrats who won in\\n\\nGeorgia are certified and Chuck Schumer becomes the majority leader? Which\\n\\nalso raises the question, does it make sense for the Senate to have a trial\\n\\neven after President Trump leaves office?\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: Well, I don't know that that's the House's business. Our business\\n\\nis to -- to impeach which is basically an indictment. And then time and\\n\\ncircumstances will determine when it will go over to the Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may recall, that the first time that the president was impeached that\\n\\nNancy Pelosi worked with the managers to make a determination as to when to\\n\\ndeliver those articles to the Senate. They were not delivered the next day.\\n\\nThey were delivered at a time that was most appropriate.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so, we'll do the same thing that -- in this instance.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut remember, Chris, we tell voters all the time that your vote is your\\n\\nvoice and I believe we have to practice the same thing. Our vote is our\\n\\nvoice and we want to voice disapproval of the actions taken by this\\n\\npresident last Wednesday and the week before down in -- the vote in\\n\\nGeorgia.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Congressman, there are -- I -- I understand the reasons to vote\\n\\nto impeach. There are some practical arguments against impeachment. It\\n\\nfurther divides the country. It mobilizes the Trump base.\\n\\n\\n\\nPerhaps most importantly, it could interfere with Joe Biden beginning his\\n\\nadministration, confirming his nominees, getting to work.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you find any of those arguments persuasive?\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: Yes. I find all of them to be persuasive. But that doesn't mean\\n\\nthat the House should not do its work.\\n\\n\\n\\nRemember the Senate determines guilt or innocence and that has to do with\\n\\nthe Senate's schedule.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, the House has to do its business. We call ourselves the people house.\\n\\nThe vast majority of the American people -- I saw the full results this\\n\\nmorning say this man should be removed from office. So if we are the\\n\\npeople's house, let's do the people's work and let's vote to impeach this\\n\\npresident and then we'll decide later or the Senate will decide later what\\n\\nto do with that -- an impeachment.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Let's go back to the events of Wednesday afternoon, as a veteran\\n\\nof the civil rights movement you have seen plenty of violence before, but\\n\\nhonestly, how worried were you about the safety of your colleagues in the\\n\\nHouse and yourself?\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: Well, Chris, I've been telling my friends and relatives that I'm\\n\\na little bit concerned with the fact that on Wednesday I never got afraid.\\n\\nI was not afraid at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe police that were assigned to me, the Capitol police did a remarkable\\n\\njob. They got me off the floor. In fact, I turn around and a so-called\\n\\nundisclosed secure location, Nancy Pelosi and I arrived there at the exact\\n\\nsame time.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I want to thank the Capitol police that were in charge of my safety.\\n\\nThey did a great job. I just wish they had the leadership at the top that\\n\\nthey're deserving of.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, let me ask you, though, because you have an unmarked office\\n\\ninside the Capitol. And you say that although it doesn't say Jim Clyburn\\n\\non it, doesn't say House Majority Whip on it, that the mob found it on\\n\\nWednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you think that there is the possibility that they had some inside help\\n\\nfrom people inside the Capitol or even perhaps at some level of the Capitol\\n\\npolice?\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: Well, I don't know that, and I was not making the accusation. I\\n\\nwas just telling you what the facts are.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a marked office, got my name on the door. But they didn't bother\\n\\nthat office. They went to the office where I usually work and where I\\n\\nusually am. And for some reason they found that office. I have no idea\\n\\nwhether or not they were up there before, whether they got some other\\n\\nschemes. Somebody may have just talked about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I'm not going to make that accusation. I do know this, my staff was in\\n\\nmy office. They were -- had all the furniture and stuff at the door. And\\n\\nthere were people trying to get in.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: President-elect Biden this week had this to say about the events\\n\\non Wednesday, the riot and the assault on the Capitol on Wednesday. Take a\\n\\nlook, sir.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT-ELECT: No one can tell me had it been a group of\\n\\nBlack Lives Matter protesting yesterday there wouldn't have been -- they\\n\\nwouldn't have been treated very, very differently.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Congressman, do you think that there was a race component to the\\n\\npolice response on Wednesday as compared to some demonstrations -- well,\\n\\nover the years but specifically the Black Lives Matter protests this\\n\\nsummer?\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: Absolutely. And I think that everybody in the country,\\n\\nirrespective of what side of that question you'd be maybe on, you know\\n\\nthere was a difference in the way they treated these, you may call them\\n\\nprotesters, I call them insurrectionists, and the way they treated the\\n\\npeaceful protesters of Black Lives Matter.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd we saw what the president -- that's where they get their signals from,\\n\\nthe president went out and ordered the removal of demonstrators near the\\n\\nWhite House so he could stand up with an upside-down Bible in front of St.\\n\\nJohn's Church. These people got their signals from him. That's the kind of\\n\\nleadership that this president has been portraying. And there are a lot of\\n\\npeople who saw in that leadership how they should conduct themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's why I said, and I'll say it again, that it's a shame that the hard\\n\\nworking rank-and-file Capitol police did not have better leadership.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Finally Congressman, Democrats are going to have a majority this\\n\\n-- in this session of Congress but not much of one. A one vote majority in\\n\\nthe Senate, a razor thin majority in the House.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a matter of practical politics, won't President Biden have to scale back\\n\\nhis agenda just to get anything passed through this Congress when it's so\\n\\ntightly divided?\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: I do not think so. I don't think that's President Biden's agenda\\n\\nshould be scaled back at all. He needs to be robust with it, simply because\\n\\nthe people voted for it and everybody in the House and the Senate know\\n\\nthat.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think he has to be careful how he makes these presentations. I think he\\n\\nhas to inform people as to what it is he's trying to do and hopefully get\\n\\nbipartisan support for it. I've said this before as well. If he doesn't get\\n\\nthe bipartisan support, do as Truman did. When he could not get the\\n\\nCongress to move to integrate the Armed Services, he issued an Executive\\n\\nOrder.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Emancipation Proclamation was an Executive Order. I can go down through\\n\\nhistory and show you how many times significant decisions have been made by\\n\\nExecutive Order.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so I think that Biden should make every effort to reach out to both\\n\\nsides of the aisle to get common sense legislation passed. But if they're\\n\\nnot going to be cooperative, then he should use his executive authority and\\n\\nget it done.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Congressman Clyburn, thank you. Thanks for\\n\\njoining us this Sunday and please come back, sir.\\n\\n\\n\\nCLYBURN: Thank you very much for having me.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss Twitter's\\n\\ndecision to ban President Trump from its platform. A reasonable effort to\\n\\nprevent violence, or a restriction of free speech?\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Coming up, Democrats clinch control of the Senate after two\\n\\nhistoric wins in Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): For the first time in six years, Democrats will\\n\\noperate a majority in the United States Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel what the new majority means for the\\n\\nBiden agenda.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. MADISON CAWTHORN (R-NC): When you rip the tongue out of somebody who\\n\\nwould speak against you, you don't prove them to be a liar, rather you just\\n\\nprove that you're paralyzed with fear on the altar of oppression.\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): The reality is that Donald Trump committed\\n\\nsedition. He incited a violent group of domestic terrorists, and\\n\\ninsurrectionists, to go to the Capitol.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Two members of Congress, Republican Madison Cawthorn and Democrat\\n\\nPramila Jayapal, reacting to Twitter's decision to ban President Trump.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group.\\n\\n\\n\\nSenator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff and president of Cavalry\\n\\nConsultants, Josh Holmes. Marie Harf, executive director of the Serve\\n\\nAmerica PAC. And Jonathan Swan from Axios.\\n\\n\\n\\nJonathan, Donald Trump says that he doubts he ever would have been elected\\n\\npresident without Twitter. How is he taking the Twitter ban at this point?\\n\\nAnd, more generally, what do you since is -- or what are you hearing is his\\n\\nmood in his final days in the White House?\\n\\n\\n\\nJONATHAN SWAN, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, AXIOS: Well, I've had a\\n\\nnumber of conversations with President Trump over the last few years about\\n\\nTwitter and FaceBook and he said to me on several occasions that it's his\\n\\nmost powerful weapon, it's his most powerful tool, and he believes that.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe may not be wrong, by the way. I mean he -- it's the way that he\\n\\ncommunicates directly with the American people. He goes around the\\n\\nmainstream media. He can speak to -- I think he's combined audiences at\\n\\nleast 150 million, may be more than that. His Twitter audience was\\n\\nsomething like 88 million and it's an incredibly intense following. There's\\n\\npeople who just are addicted his Twitter feed. So he will see this is a\\n\\nhuge blow to him.\\n\\n\\n\\nI spoke to two people who have talked to the president in the last 24\\n\\nhours. They told me he wasn't yelling or raging. He's, obviously, very\\n\\nangry about it. I know inside the White House right now they're trying to\\n\\nturn their attention for the next few days on how they can fight back\\n\\nagainst these social media companies. So I wouldn't be surprised -- I know\\n\\nthat -- I mean one person last night said to me, everything's on the table.\\n\\nI don't what that means policy wise. I said are we talking executive\\n\\norders? They said, everything's on the table.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don't know what's achievable and what's realistic and what they can\\n\\nactually do in terms of executive action. But I can tell you, they are\\n\\nlooking very, very hard at that and Dan Scavino, the president's social\\n\\nmedia guy, is heavily involved in that.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Josh, Twitter is not a public utility, it's a private company. If\\n\\nit says, as it does, that there is continuing talk about insurrection on\\n\\nits platform, doesn't it have, one could argue, an obligation to police\\n\\nthat even if that rises up to the tweets of the president of the United\\n\\nStates?\\n\\n\\n\\nJOSH HOLMES, FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO MITCH MCCONNELL, PRESIDENT AND\\n\\nFOUNDING PARTNER, CAVALRY: Well, they certainly have the ability as a\\n\\nprivate company to do anything that they'd like to do, and that includes\\n\\nplatforming every conservative if they'd like to. I think the larger\\n\\nproblem here is any effort, historically-speaking, to stifle free speech\\n\\nultimately has resulted in making the problem that you're trying to cure\\n\\nmuch, much worse because ultimately all of this speech gets funneled down\\n\\ninto smaller silos, to more extreme sects, to further radicalize and push\\n\\naway sort of mainstream thought. And I think you can see that already\\n\\nhappening here.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm less concerned about this in terms of what it means for Donald Trump's\\n\\nTwitter account. I'm more concerned about the precedent that it sets for\\n\\nconservative speech going forward. And I think that is what most\\n\\nRepublicans and conservatives are looking at as a real problem for what\\n\\nTwitter has done here.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Some of the blowback to the Twitter ban is based on how Twitter\\n\\nexplained, justified cutting off the president. I want to put up a couple\\n\\nof explanations.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter said the president talking about American patriots is being\\n\\ninterpreted on Twitter as support for the mob that attacked the Capitol.\\n\\nTwitter says the president announcing he won't attend the inauguration may\\n\\nencourage people to attack on January 20th because he won't be there.\\n\\n\\n\\nMarie, is there some tortured reasoning there to ban President Trump from\\n\\nTwitter and what about the decision of Amazon and other big tech companies\\n\\nnow to basically shut down Parler, which is a social media platform that\\n\\nconservatives have chosen instead of Twitter and FaceBook?\\n\\n\\n\\nMARIE HARF, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, SERVE AMERICA PAC AND FOX NEWS\\n\\nCONTRIBUTOR:\\n\\nWell, Chris, Donald Trump has arguably violated Twitter's rules that they\\n\\nhave for their platform for years now. So while these last tweets that he\\n\\nposted may not have been his worst, certainly he has done worse things on\\n\\nTwitter. They were, I think, probably the last straw.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the most interesting part of Twitter's statement, actually, I think,\\n\\nwas the last statement, how they have information both from their platform\\n\\nand from other sources that Donald Trump was encouraging violence around\\n\\nthe inauguration to come. So not just punishing him for violence that\\n\\nalready happened that left five people that on Wednesday, but that they\\n\\nwere looking forward and concerned about preventing further violence.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd when it comes to Parler, I mean Parler is an even worse version of\\n\\nTwitter where we've see multiple people calling for Vice President Pence to\\n\\nbe killed, including people that have been on President Trump's legal team.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I think these social media companies have always been drinking from a\\n\\nfire hose when it comes to hate on their platforms. But when they saw and\\n\\ninsurrection jump from the pages of, you know, of Twitter from the posts of\\n\\nTwitter to real life on Wednesday, it was different for them.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Right.\\n\\n\\n\\nHARF: It became reality and not just words on a platform. And I think\\n\\nthat's why they took such drastic action.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Meanwhile, there are growing calls to remove President Trump\\n\\neither through the 25th Amendment or through impeachment and trial in the\\n\\nSenate.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere is Republican Senator Pat Toomey. Take a look.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. PAT TOOMEY (R-PA): I do think the president's behavior this week does\\n\\ndisqualify him from serving. I do think the president committed impeachable\\n\\noffenses.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: I don't think you can overstate how bitter feelings are in the\\n\\nRepublican Party towards President Trump. Just this morning, Pat Toomey,\\n\\nthat senator you just saw, has escalated and now says he believes that\\n\\nDonald Trump should resign immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, over the weekend, a source close to Vice President Pence tells me that\\n\\nwhen Pence, the mob had broken through and Pence had been taken down to a\\n\\nbunker in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, that President Trump -- this is\\n\\ncoming from a source close to Pence -- President Trump never reached out to\\n\\ninquire about Pence's safety and to this day has never condemned the people\\n\\nthat were in the Capitol on Wednesday calling to hang Vice President Pence.\\n\\n\\n\\nAll of this leads to the question, Josh, as the former chief of staff to\\n\\nMitch McConnell, what do you think are the prospects that the Senate, if\\n\\nthere's an impeachment, will vote to remove Donald Trump as president,\\n\\neither -- either to convict him and remove him while he's still president\\n\\nor even after he leaves, to convict him and say he can never run for office\\n\\nagain?\\n\\n\\n\\nHOLMES: Well, I mean the behavior that you described just now, Chris, is\\n\\nobviously abhorrent and I think that there is a much stronger case for\\n\\nimpeachment now than there certainly was a year ago when I strongly\\n\\ndisagreed with the case that was made.\\n\\n\\n\\nI thought the interesting part of your interview with Representative\\n\\nClyburn was his suggestion that they would move to impeach in the House and\\n\\nthen hold the paperwork, essentially not giving it over to the Senate,\\n\\nbecause it's important to note that once the Senate receives articles of\\n\\nimpeachment, they have to proceed expeditiously. It's not an option. They\\n\\nactually have to do it.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou saw a memo over the weekend saying that they wouldn't move until the\\n\\n19th, that they couldn't move until the 19th. If the papers were delivered\\n\\nat that point, it would be literally right on top of the Biden\\n\\ninauguration. Clearly Democrats don't want to do that. And so the\\n\\nsuggestion that Clyburn made there was that they would hold it for a period\\n\\nof time.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, once it gets to the Senate, that's Chuck Schumer's Senate. Obviously\\n\\nhe's the new majority leader at that point and they're going to have to\\n\\nproceed with a case and a trial. The Senate doesn't convict without hearing\\n\\nevidence from both sides. I don't know ultimately where the votes lead. I\\n\\ndo know that their case is much stronger than it was a year ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break. We'll leave it there.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we come back, Joe Biden's agenda. With Democrats now in control of\\n\\nCongress, what can he get through and what can Republicans still block?\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: I am focused now on us\\n\\ntaking control as president and vice president on the 20th and to get our\\n\\nagenda moving as quickly as we can.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: President-elect Biden ducking questions about impeachment as he\\n\\nprepares to take office in just ten days.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\\n\\n\\n\\nJosh, Joe Biden will have majorities in the House and Senate, but pretty\\n\\nsmall ones, razor-thin, really, in both houses. Given the fact that he'll\\n\\nhave just 51 votes in the Senate, but that is enough for budget\\n\\nreconciliation, it is enough to confirm your nominees if the Democrats all\\n\\nline up behind him, what do you think that he can get through in the Senate\\n\\nand what do you think Republicans will still be able to block?\\n\\n\\n\\nHOLMES: Well, I think the first biggest decision he needs to make with\\n\\nDemocratic leaders is whether they want the first hundred days to be mired\\n\\nin an impeachment trial about his predecessor, which, you know, it clearly\\n\\nwould have an impact on everything that -- from his legislative agenda to\\n\\nhis nominees.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe only thing that really changed on Tuesday with the two wins in Georgia\\n\\nwhere the nominations and confirmations. He can clearly go through a\\n\\nDemocratic majority and work through those pretty quickly. But he's going\\n\\nto need a substantial bipartisan effort to get any sort of legislation\\n\\nacross the finish line because of that 60 vote threshold. They do not have\\n\\nthe votes to try to limit the filibuster. So there's going to need to be\\n\\nsome bipartisanship.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe one caveat to that is the budget. If they can pass a budget, they can\\n\\nthen operate in this sort of arcane reconciliation rules that ultimately\\n\\nallow them to change tax policy with a simple majority. That's a big thing\\n\\nto watch in the first quarter and I think something that this\\n\\nadministration will focus on.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Marie, what's your sense of Biden's legislative calendar schedule?\\n\\nWhat do you get the sense he's going to push first? What do you think he'll\\n\\nput off until later in the year? And given the fact that, you know, it's\\n\\nnow just a few votes in the House and one vote in the Senate, do you think\\n\\nthere's some parts of the agenda that he campaigned on that are just going\\n\\nto go on the back burner?\\n\\n\\n\\nHARF: Well, Chris, I think, number one has to be getting his team in place.\\n\\nAnd that involves dealing with everything from COVID to the economy and\\n\\njobs to national security. And so I do think that there's a strong sense\\n\\nthat confirmations have to happen immediately. And then paired with that is\\n\\nthe question of additional COVID relief for Americans. He has talked about\\n\\nthe $2,000 checks, getting more relief to small businesses, getting\\n\\nunemployment relief to people. I think that will be a first priority as\\n\\nwell.\\n\\n\\n\\nObviously, the vaccination program isn't really legislative. I think\\n\\nthey'll probably be more focused on that through executive action and the\\n\\nexecutive branch.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I actually think that this is an opportunity for senators like Joe\\n\\nManchin, Chris Coons, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, the folks clustered\\n\\naround the middle of both parties, to come together to help Biden get\\n\\nthings passed like infrastructure for example, things passed like tweaks to\\n\\nour health care system. You know, Joe Biden did not campaign on huge,\\n\\nradical change, he campaigned on working across the aisle to address things\\n\\nlike prescription drugs. And so I think that once we get through this\\n\\ninitial period of time where he gets his team in place and works to really\\n\\nattack the coronavirus issue, those are the kinds of things he's going to\\n\\nlook at.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Wednesday afternoon, when the insurrectionist were still inside\\n\\nthe Capitol, President Trump put out this video.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This was a fraudulent\\n\\nelection, but we can't play into the hands of these people. We have to have\\n\\npeace.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Jonathan, from what your sources are telling you, does Donald\\n\\nTrump think that after January 20th he still has a role to play in national\\n\\npolitics and that he still has a base that will follow and support him?\\n\\n\\n\\nSWAN: Well, he does have a base that will follow and support him. It will\\n\\nbe the height of naivety to think that he doesn't. And, in fact, I think\\n\\npeople drastically overstating the extent to which Donald Trump is a\\n\\ndiminished figure after this. Yes, he's a -- of course he's a -- he --\\n\\nthere's no doubt he's lost some -- and Josh probably has a better read on\\n\\nthis than I do, some number of Republicans. He's certainly lost quite a few\\n\\nelected Republicans.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I don't -- I haven't seen any evidence yet that he's lost a huge\\n\\nproportion of the Republican base who, you have to remember, was -- and we\\n\\nknow this both from data, like hard, quantitative data, but also from focus\\n\\ngroups and from anecdote and from activists in the field, that he had an\\n\\nincredible bond with the Republican base. A very intense bond that I've\\n\\nseen firsthand at many Trump rallies and there are some things -- I'm not\\n\\nconvinced that goes away at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I think people should be very wary of dismissing Trump as somebody who\\n\\nhas serious power, his own type of power outside of Washington going far\\n\\nbeyond January 20th.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: Josh, let's change and pivot more to the official party, the\\n\\nelected officials, the party infrastructure. How much support has Donald\\n\\nTrump lost over this last week inside that part of the GOP? Does he still\\n\\nhave support? Does he still have clout? Or to what degree has that\\n\\ndiminished?\\n\\n\\n\\nHOLMES: Well, I mean, Chris, there's been a seismic change this week and I\\n\\nthink it's a combination of factors, obviously ending with what happened on\\n\\nWednesday. But there was a fatigue everything post-election of the\\n\\npresident focusing entirely on this, you know, fraudulent election message\\n\\nthat, you know, wasn't true. And most everybody knew it. But instead of\\n\\nsort of getting behind what was ultimately going to be the future of the\\n\\nparty in two Georgia Senate races, the president continued to focus on how\\n\\nwe would be president ultimately. That began to chip away. And as the\\n\\nrhetoric began to be more and more pointed, more and more away from the\\n\\nfuture of the party, I think there has been a significant slide.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere that ends with Wednesday, as you saw a number Republican senators\\n\\nspeaking very directly to this for the first time on the Senate floor. You\\n\\nhad senators like Tom Cotton, Mike Lee, Tim Scott representing sort of the\\n\\nnext stage of conservatism in Washington, D.C., begin to open a new lane\\n\\nthere.\\n\\n\\n\\nJonathan Swan is quite right that there is still a huge bases of support\\n\\nwithin the Republican Party throughout this country, but we're beginning to\\n\\nsee the slow turn here.\\n\\n\\n\\nWALLACE: All right, panel, thank you. See you next Sunday.\\n\\n\\n\\nUp next, our Power Player of the week. You're going to want to watch this\\n\\none.

{"original": "In a move President Trump said will reduce car prices but will also anger environmental groups, the administration is revoking California's authority to set strict fuel economy standards.\\n\\nTrump announced the move Wednesday, saying the decision was made in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, while making cars safer at the same time.\\n\\nTRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS\\n\\nThis will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety advantage, and also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars, Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.\\n\\nCalifornia's authority to set its own emissions standards tougher than the federal government's goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. The state has long pushed automakers to adopt more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less pollution. A dozen states and the District of Columbia also follow California's fuel economy standards.\\n\\nThe Trump administration decision revokes that waiver, touching off what is sure to be another high-profile legal fight with the Golden State.\\n\\nIn anticipation of the move, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Tuesday that the administration's action will hurt both U.S. automakers and American families. He said California would fight the administration in federal court.\\n\\nYou have no basis and no authority to pull this waiver, Becerra, a Democrat, said in a statement, referring to Trump. We're ready to fight for a future that you seem unable to comprehend.\\n\\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the White House has abdicated its responsibility to the rest of the world on cutting emissions and fighting global warming.\\n\\nThe president, though, claimed there would be very little difference in emissions between the federal and California's standard, but said cars will be far safer and much less expensive. He also predicted that a new national standard for fuel economy will result in more cars being produced by the U.S. and more jobs.\\n\\nThe move comes after the Justice Department recently opened an antitrust investigation into a deal between California and four automakers for tougher pollution and related mileage requirements than those sought by Trump.\\n\\nTrump also has sought to relax Obama-era federal mileage standards nationwide, weakening a key effort by his Democratic predecessor to slow climate change.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nWe embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told the National Automobile Dealers Association Tuesday, adding that higher fuel economy standards would hurt consumers by increasing the average sticker price of new cars and requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists condemned the Trump administration's move, which comes as gasoline prices have crept higher following a weekend drone attack that hobbled Saudi Arabian oil output.\\n\\nEveryone wins when we adopt strong clean car standards as our public policy, said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense Fund. Strong clean car standards give us healthier air to breathe, help protect us from the urgent threat of climate change and save Americans hundreds of dollars a year in gas expenses.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "This is a rush transcript from Hannity, January 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nSEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to Hannity.\\n\\nWe begin tonight, a FOX News alert -- get this -- James Comey, I hope you're sitting down for this big breaking news only moments ago. Federal prosecutors are now reportedly investigating high-level leaks, classified material from the FBI. And the super patriot himself, according to reports, is likely the target of a criminal probe.\\n\\nNow, remember, only a few months ago in an unrelated case, the DOJ inspector general referred Comey for a prosecution over leaks and lack of candor surrounding his communications with President Trump. Now, more trouble for Jim Comey. We'll have details analysis and more on this major story coming up.\\n\\nFirst, tonight, more manufactured hysteria from the D.C. swamp. Let me be clear there is absolutely nothing significant nothing meaningful about this charade, this miscarriage of justice on Capitol Hill. You have conspiracy theorists, con artists and liars, same people that have been doing it for the last three years, they are now dragging this country through the mud and it's all out of pure rage, denial, hatred psychosis and insanity.\\n\\nI want to begin with this monologue on this point, I want to ask everyone a simple question, you playing at home, answer in your mind's eye the question and I really want you to think about it. Since Donald Trump was elected in 2016, think, what have Democrats -- what are the media -- what are they ever done to improve the lives of Americans? Now, have they done anything to create jobs, prosperity, safety, security, peace?\\n\\nWell, today's cover of The New York Post, a perfect representation of what I am talking about. On the one side, there you have President Trump signing what many thought could never be done -- a really great, historic trade deal with China, $220 billion in the next two years alone -- this year and next year -- and that will impact the energy sector, the service sector, manufacturing sector, our farmers benefit greatly, $220 billion. That helps the American economy and helps American workers.\\n\\nOn the other side of the picture, there's Nancy Pelosi smiling, a dozen commemorative pens to sign off on two bogus articles of impeachment, and then taking pictures with, yes, smiles. And Nancy's blatant political stunts will improve the lives of zero Americans. It will add zero jobs to the economy. It does nothing to make us more safe or secure, and we all know the outcome. It's going to die in the Senate.\\n\\nIt was just a few months ago that Nancy Pelosi said impeachment must be bipartisan. No Republicans supported it. And then she rammed through articles of impeachment in the House with the support of only Democrats.\\n\\nPelosi also said impeachment was so dire and so urgent, we got to pass it in record time. She then refused to send the articles to the Senate for over a month, a weeks-long stall that almost no one can explain. And Democrats -- that was after they passed it so quickly before Christmas so they can go on vacation for three weeks.\\n\\nAnd don't forget, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, constantly reminding we, the people, impeachment was her solemn duty. She didn't want to do it. She was so prayerful and somber. Of course, that also a lie.\\n\\nTake a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: So this is a very serious matter and we take it to heart in a really solemn way.\\n\\nSo sad, so tragic for a country.\\n\\nDecember 18th, a great day for the Constitution of the United States, a sad one for America, that the president's reckless activities necessitated us -\\n\\n- our having to introduce articles of impeachment.\\n\\nThis is nothing that anybody takes any satisfaction in. It's sad for our country.\\n\\nThere's just no joy in this. It's sad. We must be somber. We must be prayerful.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nHANNITY: Sad, somber, prayerful.\\n\\nYou want a pen? You'd like a pen? Got dozens of them. Smile for the camera, we did it!\\n\\nSo Pelosi who was so somber and prayerful, she gleefully handed the special commemorative pens to her smiling colleagues so they could all take pictures together after signing the articles, all smiles -- a political stunt borne out of rage from beginning to end.\\n\\nNow, the Democrats' charade continues in the U.S. Senate. Tonight, they want to introduce new B.S. evidence and charges and material and witnesses that were not part of the case. Remember, the sole power of the Constitution to impeach is in the House. They passed it already.\\n\\nNow, if a few weak Republican senators try and help their radical Democratic colleagues and allow them to call new witnesses to do the job, the constitutional duty of the House, and enter all these new evidence, guess what's going to happen? This actually is a great thing -- I want to hear from zero experience Hunter Biden who's paid millions of dollars, no experience. Wow, what a deal? What company would ever give you millions then you know nothing about the business?\\n\\nAnd then, of course, we've got quid pro quo Joe. Let's bring him in to testify. You're not getting the billion at least you fire the prosecutor that I know is investigating my zero experience son.\\n\\nAnd the fake hearsay whistleblowers should be called to testify.\\n\\nBut perhaps my favorite, will be calling the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar Adam Schiff, let's put him under oath. Senator Ted Cruz and now, Senator Rand Paul, vowing to trigger a reciprocal witness list if any Republican caves to the Democrats' demands.\\n\\nSenator Paul's predicting no Republican will vote to convict the president.\\n\\nI tend to agree with them, except Mitt Romney.\\n\\nI don't know why Mitt Romney's angry. Mitt Romney hates Donald Trump, every second of every day. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is doing everything Mitt Romney said he would do if he had got elected president. It makes no sense to me.\\n\\nHere with more, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\\n\\nSenator, good for you. You were wrong on the War Powers Act, but that's a longstanding debate we have.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBut I think --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nSEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: I don't have time to straighten (ph) you out on that tonight.\\n\\nHANNITY: No, but this is important, because we really do have --\\n\\nPAUL: Yes.\\n\\nHANNITY: Can you think of any company anywhere in the world that whatever paid millions and millions of dollars to somebody that has zero experience?\\n\\nCan you -- would any business ever do that?\\n\\nPAUL: Well, it goes to the heart of the matter of the president's being accused of withholding foreign aid and his argument is, well, we were studying corruption and we wanted to know about corruption in Ukraine, and I think the Bidens are as corrupt as the day is long.\\n\\nNo young man who's the son of a politician gets 50 grand a month who has no experience --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nHANNITY: Eighty-three. I think it was 83.\\n\\nPAUL: -- working for a Ukrainian oligarch, you know? I mean, for goodness sakes, it smells to high heaven. It smells like corruption.\\n\\nAnd every day on the mainstream media, they say, oh, there's no there there. This has been investigated. There's no corruption.\\n\\nI think the American people don't buy it.\\n\\nBut here's the thing, is fair is fair, and if they're going to put the president through this, they're going to have to have witnesses on both sides.\\n\\nBut I'll tell you what my fear is, is that some Republicans are going to vote for witnesses, we'll get those, the ones the Democrats want and then when we have the votes on bringing witnesses or letting the president choose his witnesses, I think those will fail, not only because of those Republicans but because a whole variety of Republicans may not allow the whistleblower, may not allow Biden for one reason or another because they served with them.\\n\\nBut if it turns out and the Republican base sees that this looks like only Democrat witnesses and no presidential witnesses, I guarantee that the Republican base will punish those people who set off that kind of scenario.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nHANNITY: A hundred -- that is --I can't support any Republican that does that. I can tell you right now. I can't, because --\\n\\nPAUL: If it looks like a kangaroo court, they're not -- the Republican base is going to be very, very unhappy.\\n\\nThis is not an ordinary vote. Everybody in the country is watching. There was not one Republican that supported impeachment in the House. I don't think there will be in the Senate.\\n\\nBut if people play games with the witnesses and, all of a sudden, we have one side and we have John Bolton who has an ax to grind about being fired coming in, but we don't let the president call witnesses he wishes to call, I think all hell's going to break loose, and I think the Republican electorate will boot out any of these people who allow this to be a one- sided episode.\\n\\nHANNITY: I got to applaud you. Good for you. Good for you. Good for Ted Cruz. This is important, because you have Joe Biden -- you are not getting the billion taxpayer dollars.\\n\\nIt is breathtaking hypocrisy where we are here. And you're calling it out and we'll watch very closely. And I hope your prediction is right in the end.\\n\\nSenator, thank you for being with us.\\n\\nNow, the left's latest desperate attempt to smear President Trump, keep his impeachment charade alive, forever -- it's insane. Earlier in the week, there you go, we got the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar himself, Adam Schiff, he attached an addendum to the articles of impeachment. He's got new evidence, filled with random documents from a Ukrainian-American named Lev Parnas.\\n\\nParnas is currently out on bail from a federal prison. What is he accused of? Orchestrating a massive campaign finance fraud scheme, oh, and hiding -\\n\\n- you can't make this up -- a million-dollar payment from where? Russia. Wow. Wouldn't even believe it in a spy novel.\\n\\nThis guy is apparently the media mob's, the Democrats' new Michael Avenatti. And naturally, they are making him their hero, a guy that's been accused of taking a million dollars and hiding it from Russia. These are the same people, especially on fake news CNN and over there at conspiracy TV, Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow's conspiracy channel, both are state-run TV.\\n\\nThey put Avenatti on the air 254 times in one year. He was begging to be on this show, the number one show in the country, but we didn't put him. And they now love Lev Parnas. Where is Avenatti?\\n\\nAnd last I heard, he is in jail facing a ton of charges. Good luck to him.\\n\\nNaturally, now, he is making the rounds in the media mob, including an appearance last night, of course, on conspiracy TV, state-run MSDNC. Now, Roswell Rachel Maddow's program, this is basically a hoax-filled dumpster fire of never ending fake news, never ending conspiracy theories directed by the Democratic Party, dressed up as an intellectual new show.\\n\\nWell, it's pathetic how wrong they have been over there the last three years. Ever get an apology for them being so wrong, Trump-Russia collusion?\\n\\nNo apologies. No accountability. Nothing.\\n\\nWhoops. Wrong again. Now, let's move onto the next lying anti-Trump a narrative and new shady guest like Avenatti and new conspiracy theories.\\n\\nDon't be fooled. It's garbage. They hype up the anti-Trump basis of the left-wing. But, we got him this time. Last night's interview with Parnas, no exception.\\n\\nNow, we are talking about a guy that got paid, apparently, according to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, these are serious people there, millions of dollars from Russia, or a million dollars, and now, accusing President Trump and pretty much everyone in his administration of pretty much everything he can think of.\\n\\nNow, when you face a possible jail term and you think you say something that might either eliminate the jail term or might lower the jail term, most people would pretty much say anything. That's how much credibility I put in this guy.\\n\\nThe president was clear today that he doesn't know the guy. But there are pictures of him and the president. You know, how many photo lines I've done in the course of my 24 years here, 21 years in TV. I've done a lot. I've actually seen pictures online. I have no idea who these people are.\\n\\nThe president doesn't remember this guy. He said so repeatedly today. DOJ says his claims are 100 percent false. His claims are full of glaring holes and contradictions. Whoopsy-daisy.\\n\\nThe foreign minister of Ukraine felt compelled to speak out and say, don't trust this guy. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's now said that he's spoken to key officials within President Zelensky's circle. Since you were one of those and you were when this happened, did you get that message from Lev Parnas?\\n\\nUKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: It's all over Ukrainian media as well today and yesterday, and strangely enough, my name was not mentioned although I'm minister of foreign affairs. And, frankly, I never spoke with this individual. Again, I don't -- I don't trust any word he is now saying.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nHANNITY: Oh, same with what Zelensky. No quid or pro or quo.\\n\\nRemember, there were five separate high-level meetings after the phone call that never mentioned aid. At all those five meetings, they never mentioned aid. That's going to be a big point that the defense of the president is going to make.\\n\\nSo, let's get this straight. The Ukrainian government is warning all of us about Lev Parnas, the new Michael Avenatti, facing serious felony charges, campaign finance and a charge of trying to hide a million dollars from Russia. Meaning, he is charged with getting paid by the country of Russia.\\n\\nBut according to the mob, we must all believe all of his breathtaking allegations. Wow. I thought they didn't like people that colluded with Russia. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: I'm trying to remember the last time that an interview revealed as much as Rachel Maddow's interview last night revealed and actually moved a story of national and international significance, as much as that interview did. I -- it was breathtaking.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nHANNITY: Joe, your change of heart to be on TV is also breathtaking, liberal Joe.\\n\\nNow, maybe you're just dumb, or maybe you're just lying to trying to be Fox & Friends, which is never going to happen. After all, the con artists and the media mob, they've been lying for years. They spread one hoax, one tin foil hoax, one conspiracy theory after another, after another, after another.\\n\\nLast night, they told us over at MSDNC, state-run TV, that the president was a Russian op. Fake news CNN claiming the phony Russian dossier was totally legit. Nearly, everyone in the mob and the media claiming the president colluded with Russian.\\n\\nAll that we're about to show you, it's false. They've never been held accountable. They've never apologized.\\n\\nWe were right on this program. Well, simultaneously, they missed the abuse of power, corruption scandal, premeditated fraud on a FISA court -- no, we did all that. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Multiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the briefing tells CNN that classified documents on Russian interference in the\\n\\n2016 election presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.\\n\\nRACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: A sort of dossier of alleged dirt that the Russians allegedly say they allegedly have on Donald Trump, alleged dirt that they allegedly used to allegedly cultivate him as basically a Russian asset.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The guilty that Robert Mueller got on October 5 and was revealed today was a guilty about collusion.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then candidate, Donald Trump, knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman, paid secret visits, multiple ones to Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump directed his attorney to lie to Congress.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nHANNITY: Bo-bop-bop-bop.\\n\\nAlmost everything you heard there is a total lie. Wrong. Dead wrong.\\n\\nWell, the mob busy pushing the psychotic anti-Trump conspiracy theories, they did miss the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history, and it was happening right before their eyes.\\n\\nWe are proud of our investigating team and our reporting here on Hannity, because we got it right. We've been vindicated by the inspector general and we expect further vindication. FISA abuse, premeditated fraud on a FISA court, we're right about that. We were right about the unlawful surveillance of the president. Yes, he was spied upon by our own government at the height of an election, and after.\\n\\nWe were right about Mueller's partisan witch hunt. We were right about Comey's abuse of power. Right about the bias, right about leaking in misconduct at the highest levels of the FBI, oh, being -- showing less than candor, lack of candor, lying McCabe, lying.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the mob too busy obsessing about a hoax. They got nothing right and everything wrong. They pushed the dirty Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier -- we now know unverifiable.\\n\\nEven The New York Times finally came around and said, yes, that dirty dossier the Hillary paid for was likely Russian disinformation from the beginning. That would tell -- mean, oh, it sounds like Russia wanted dirt out there on Donald Trump to help Hillary. They did this whole thing while pretending to be so upset about Trump-Russia collusion that never occurred.\\n\\nWell, Lev Parnas, he takes a million dollars according to prosecutors in New York from Russians. They don't care. They've learned nothing.\\n\\nAll they know is hatred, rage, all things anti-Trump. It is so intense that they've lost all touch with basic reason, common sense, intellectual honesty, equal justice and application of our laws.\\n\\nThe media is a mob. Their fellow Democrats, they're also part of a mob and they're all suffering from a full-blown psychosis.\\n\\nAnd today, one fake news reporter at fake news CNN who clearly is promoting Schiff's new Parnas evidence was confronted, by who, Arizona Senator Martha McSally -- good for her. Watch this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMANU RAJU, CNN REPORTER: She made it very clear that she wasn't going to answer that question. The question again was, whether or not the president, whether or not the Senate should considered any new to have evidence that all this come out as part of the deliberations the Senate considers whether to remove the president from office and this is what she said.\\n\\nSenator McSally, should the Senate consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial?\\n\\nSEN. MARTHA MCSALLY, R-ARIZ.: Man, you're a liberal hack. I'm not talking to you.\\n\\nREPORTER: You're not going to comment?\\n\\nMCSALLY: You're a liberal hack.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nHANNITY: You are a liberal hack. They're all liberal hacks. What a great battle for our Republican senators to deal with fake news industry.\\n\\nLev Parnas, or Avenatti, let's call him, 2.0, he shouldn't be trusted.\\n\\nUkraine is telling us not to trust him. Anyone with any small grasp on reality can see this.\\n\\nDemocrats, they don't care. Radio legend, Rush Limbaugh predicted months ago, in November, got to give him credit here, this may have been in the works for months. Nothing they do surprises me.\\n\\nRemember Julie Swetnick? Remember Kavanaugh? Seemed like, one after another.\\n\\nAvenatti brought in Swetnick, they wanted to believe here. In every -- every almost every other weekend, they had to line up and they spiked the punch balls and the boys would line in the halls and they would rape these young women almost every other weekend.\\n\\nWell, I never saw Justice Kavanaugh, oh, yes, he had a red solo cap, and he was in a hall, but he wasn't lined up in a hall, and that did flame out, too.\\n\\nBut it takes a long time to get to the truth. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Who's next?\\n\\nWell, I want to throw out a name. And let's see if I'm right. Let's just see.\\n\\nThe name is Lev Parnas. Lev Parnas could well be the next surprise twist, the surprise witness for the Democrats. I think this is going to be Schiff's next guy. This is the next bombshell, meaning the whistle-blower is no longer necessary. His information has been trumped, so to speak by Lev Parnas.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nHANNITY: November 11th, good call, Rush.\\n\\nHere with reaction, White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz.\\n\\nYou know, you think about this, doesn't it fit a pattern?\\n\\nReince, you lived through it at the beginning. Doesn't fit the same pattern of what they do, how the act, how wrong they always are?\\n\\nREINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Yes, I remember the night of the fake dossier, and trying to put that to bed.\\n\\nBut, look, you hit on something. If you watch the Rachel Maddow interview last night, when she finished her show and then Lawrence O'Donnell took over, he was congratulating her about the interview and he said, you must have been working on this for a long time. And she said, I've been working on this interview for months.\\n\\nIf you go back, that's what she said. So, in other words, Schiff knew, Pelosi knew, slow walking the articles of impeachment. They all knew. They were all in on it.\\n\\nSo, my point has been, as you and I have been talking about a lot lately, is to stop treating this as if it's a real trial and not a political operation. This is a new political weapon in modern political -- in our modern political world, and Donald Trump is the first victim.\\n\\nA hundred years from now, if a president doesn't have the House in the same party, that president is going to be impeached. So, it's time to play hardball.\\n\\nI love the phrase reciprocal witness list. It's exactly right, and Biden is needed in order for us to test the reasonableness of the president bringing up corruption and Biden on the call. But Hunter Biden is needed to test what this case is all about.\\n\\nHANNITY: Well said, Reince Priebus.\\n\\nMatt Gaetz, I think this is important. The president said something. They never talked about aid in the call.\\n\\nYou are surrounding yourself with some of the same people as your predecessors. I don't think that's a good idea. That was revealing, because it showed the president thinking, wait a minute, I don't know if I can trust you.\\n\\nThen, we have the whole issue of, you know, all of the corruption. You know, the president does have a sworn duty to faithfully execute the laws of our land, and then the five meetings after. They never once talked about aid, Matt.\\n\\nREP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: If anything, the Lev Parnas interview proves that the president was entirely correct to be skeptical about Ukraine and whether or not corruption would impact U.S. investment in that country.\\n\\nDemocrats are really scraping the bottom of the barrel if they think that Lev Parnas is their star witness. We've all successfully smoked out that the Steele dossier was a part of a foreign interference campaign against our democracy. It may very well be with these Russian payments to Lev Parnas that Lev himself is part of a disinformation campaign.\\n\\nAs this moves to the Senate and we look at witnesses, Sean, one witness I want to see is Adam Schiff. Even before the motion to dismiss, there should be a motion to disqualify Schiff as an impeachment manager, because he is a fact witness to the setup.\\n\\nHANNITY: I don't think the senators -- Republicans have the stomach for it.\\n\\nReince, that's sad. That bothers me.\\n\\nPRIEBUS: Yes, no doubt about it. And guess what, sometimes the best defense is the so what defense, which is if everything the Democrats said is true, it's still not impeachable, if everything Lev Parnas has said is true, it's still not impeachable. I mean, that's what this is about.\\n\\nHANNITY: Great point. It's great point.\\n\\nAll right. The only quid and pro and quo is Joe and zero experience Hunter.\\n\\nWhen we come back -- thank you both -- Senator Marsha Blackburn calling on key senators to recuse themselves from this Schiff sham show. She will be here to tell you and the great one, Mark Levin, coming up.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nHANNITY: All right. The Democrats' Schiff sham impeachment show is officially headed to the Senate and will take 2020 candidates, Senator Warren, Sanders, Klobuchar off the campaign trail.\\n\\nAlthough Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn has a good idea: just recuse yourselves. Tweeting that the senators are, quote, spending millions of dollars to defeat Donald Trump and we are supposed to believe they will be impartial during this trial? They should recuse themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\nHere with reaction, Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee.\\n\\nSenator, it makes total sense to me.\\n\\nSEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R-TENN.: Absolutely. I think that they should take themselves out of this trial and they took an oath that they're going to give impartial justice. And if you're spending those millions of dollars and hundreds of hours, Sean, how in the world can you do that?\\n\\nAnd if these guys are out there in Iowa campaign this weekend, they need to think long and hard about coming back and sitting and saying they are going to be an impartial juror in this trial.\\n\\nHANNITY: Well, did (ph) it take a sworn oath to be fair?\\n\\nBLACKBURN: They took an oath today. And, you know, the thing is, there is precedent for asking for recusal. When you look at the 1868 trial of Andrew Johnson, who was a Tennessean, there was a request there for someone who would have succeeded President Johnson to recuse themselves from that trial.\\n\\nSo, I think that those who are sitting as a juror, they have been sworn in and they are running for president and would benefit by President Trump facing this impeachment, I think that they should recuse themselves from this discussion.\\n\\nHANNITY: Why are some of your Senate colleagues talking about bringing in new witnesses? Because it's the House's sole constitutional authority to impeach. They've impeached him.\\n\\nBLACKBURN: Right.\\n\\nHANNITY: They'll now make their case.\\n\\nWhy do some Senate Republicans want to bolster their case? Either they make it or they don't make it.\\n\\nBLACKBURN: Well, you're right about that.\\n\\nAnd you said something very important. It is the sole responsibility of the House to impeach, the action item. It is our responsibility to review the impeachment once it is delivered to us, those two articles. And to go outside of that is to go outside of our constitutional duty.\\n\\nSo, we should review the articles. We should hear what the managers have to say from the House and the president's team, their position, and then we should ask our questions. And we should make a decision if we're going to proceed --\\n\\nHANNITY: Amen.\\n\\nBLACKBURN: -- toward a vote of acquittal or guilt.\\n\\nAnd, of course, I feel that the president will be acquitted.\\n\\nWhen you look at the partial record and the sloppy work that has been done over in the House, and now, they're bringing into us and they're saying, well, you need to expand this -- that is not our job.\\n\\nIf Jerry Nadler wants to hear from more witnesses, he should be doing his work himself.\\n\\nHANNITY: They'll start all over again.\\n\\nBLACKBURN: Yes.\\n\\nHANNITY: All right. Senator, thank you. A lot of clarification.\\n\\nBLACKBURN: Good to be with you. Thank you.\\n\\nHANNITY: All right. Also, tonight, the left is ecstatic over the GOA, included the White House Budget Office technically violated the little known Impoundment Control Act by delaying aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nNow, the acting director of OMB, he's firing back. He wrote this: The GAO opinion comes from the same people who said we couldn't keep national parks open during the shutdown.\\n\\nRecently, GAO flipped its position twice in just the last few months. We wouldn't be surprised if they reverse again. Regardless, the administration complied with the law at every step.\\n\\nAnd breaking tonight, The New York Times is reporting that the DOJ probe into leaks of classified material appears focused on Mr. Super Patriot himself. That's right, Jimbo Comey.\\n\\nHere with reaction, author of Guilt by Association, Professor Alan Dershowitz, along with Fox News contributor, Jason Chaffetz.\\n\\nLet's start with the legal side -- Professor.\\n\\nALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR, GUILT BY ACCUSATION: Well, first of all, the name of my book is Guilt By Accusation.\\n\\nHANNITY: All right, sorry.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: And you can now get by $1.99 on Kindle, the cost of a candy bar.\\n\\nLook, GAO got it exactly backward. Here's what they said: The law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities to those Congress has enacted into law.\\n\\nIt's exactly the opposite. The Constitution does not allow Congress to substitute its own priorities for the foreign policy of the president.\\n\\nConsider for example the Iran deal. Congress didn't support the Iran deal.\\n\\nThey didn't want the Iran deal. President Obama imposed the Iran deal because the president has exclusive power over foreign policy.\\n\\nOr imagine Congress in the future saying, we are going to give aid to Cuba and you have to send the money to Cuba. And the president says, no, no, no, that's not my foreign policy. My foreign policy is opposed to Cuba.\\n\\nIt is unconstitutional for a statute to take away the president's sole authority over foreign policy. The only limitation on the president's authority is he can't declare war. Other than that, he can decide the Jerusalem embassy for Israel without congressional authorization. He can decide who not to give money to.\\n\\nAnd what he did, he never stopped the money from going, but postponing it to make sure that there was no corruption. Completely within his constitutional power and Congress has no authority to compromise that. And the GAO is completely wrong.\\n\\nHANNITY: And, by the way, Jason Chaffetz, I found that the GAO thought that Obama broke the law many times and wasn't a big deal then, was it?\\n\\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, multiple times the GAO was found -- and, of course, the media never made any hay about it.\\n\\nBut, Sean, the thing is so frustrating is that the money flowed. It did so before the deadline. I mean, what's the problem here? The money actually went to Ukraine. It went before the deadline.\\n\\nAnd thank goodness, President Trump is doing what he promised to do. He is not just going to simply take hundreds of millions of dollars and throw it into the government without making sure that they are actually going to do things like clean up corruption. That's what the president said he was going to do. That's exactly what President Trump has tried to do.\\n\\nAnd the GAO, for them to come out with this result, is absolutely wrong. It is totally 100 percent wrong and I totally agree with Professor Dershowitz.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: Remember, too, the GAO is a congressional organization. They always side with Congress over the president, because they work for Congress, even though they are nonpartisan.\\n\\nHANNITY: Ahh, well said.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: They work for Congress, not the executive branch.\\n\\nHANNITY: By the way, I paid for a hard copy of the book. If I would have known you could get it for 99 cents, I want a refund.\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: He can give free one. He can give you a free one, Sean.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: All right.\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: I read both of your books. Thank you both.\\n\\nAll right. Buckle up. I talked to him before the show. You don't want to miss this. The great one -- what's really motivating the Democrats during this impeachment hoax, charade.\\n\\nAnd later, the war inside the Democratic Party, reaching a breaking point.\\n\\nWe are going to tell you why with Dan Bongino and Geraldo. Let's see if they fight again tonight, straight ahead.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nHANNITY: All right. So, last night, a Jeopardy contestants were stumped by a photo of a certain, well, compromised, corrupt, cowardly, congenital liar congressman. Pretty funny. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: U.S. representatives for 12.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: One fifty-third of California's House delegation is this Intelligence Committee chairman.\\n\\nHis name is Adam Schiff.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nHANNITY: Joining us now, the author of The New York Times bestseller, Unfreedom of the Press, we call him a great one. He hosted the number one show, 8:00 p.m., right here on the FOX News Channel, Life, Liberty, Levin, nationally syndicated radio host and friend of the program.\\n\\nGreat one, I know you've got a lot to say tonight. I won't even throw a question at you.\\n\\nMARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: I won't even have enough time but let's start.\\n\\nRemember this? Anybody remember this? This was the Mueller report. Remember all this? Hundreds of subpoenas, hundreds of witnesses, millions of pages of documents. Nothing. They still have nothing.\\n\\nI want to tell you how concerned the Democrats are about foreign interference in our elections. First of all, Obama did nothing to stop the Russians from interfering in the 2016 election. In fact, his administration spied on this president of the United States when he was a candidate.\\n\\nIt was Hillary Clinton who colluded with the Russians and the DNC. They paid for that dossier. You know all this.\\n\\nBut let's talk about the Democrats and how serious they are about foreign interference in our elections. I'll go to my book, briefly, if I may. Back in the 1990s, we had a president by the name of Bill Clinton. He was impeached, but he wasn't impeached for what I'm about to talk about. He was running for reelection.\\n\\nThe media really didn't care about the scandal that broke. The L.A. Times and a few others did. And here's what they wrote: The chief of China's military intelligence secretly directed funds from Beijing to help reelect President Clinton in 1996. Former Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung told federal investigators. Chung said he met three times with intelligence officials who ordered $300,000 deposited into the Torrance businessman's bank account to subsidize campaign donations intended for Clinton, according to sources.\\n\\nChung spent around a great deal of foreign money on Democratic candidates and organizations, and bought himself repeated access to the White House.\\n\\nHe contributed more than $400,000 to various Democratic campaigns. This is Chinese military money.\\n\\nVisited the White House no fewer than 50 times and brought numerous Chinese associates to events with the president and first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. That would have been Trump's opponent, you might have remembered in 2016.\\n\\nCharlie Trie, a longtime friend of President Clinton, raised $1.2 million in foreign dollars for the Clinton legal defense fund and the DNC. In March 1996, Trie dropped off a donation of $460,000 at the Washington office of the Clinton defense fund with some of the money and sequentially numbered money orders made out in the same handwriting. He visited the White House\\n\\n22 times.\\n\\nLos Angeles Times, James Riady, another longtime friend of President Clinton, who heads the worldwide Lippo Banking Group, pleaded guilty. He was involved.\\n\\nThe Times also noted that former Democratic fund-raiser, John Huang, a onetime official at Lippo, pleaded guilty in the scandal a few years ago. What did he do? Huang raised more than $1.5 million from illegal foreign source, visited the White House 78 damn times.\\n\\nThere is your Democrat Party.\\n\\nNow, what did Nancy Pelosi say when the Red Chinese military was spreading millions of dollars around to the Clinton campaign, to the DNC, and all the rest? She didn't say a thing.\\n\\nWhere was the independent counsel investigation? There was no independent counsel investigation.\\n\\nWhere was most of the media? They were nowhere.\\n\\nHere's another one for you, Democrats, out there. In the 1980s, we had a president called Ronald Reagan. He was phenomenally popular. But Ted Kennedy wanted to stop his reelection.\\n\\nWhat did he do? Information in the files. It's been reported by The London Times. Been reported by Professor Kengur (ph), in the files of the KGB, through back channels.\\n\\nThe Lion of the Senate, who many on the left wanted to be president of the United States, tried to collaborate with the KGB to defeat Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan, in his second term. There's your damn Democratic Party.\\n\\nWhat else? Oh, the GAO comes out. Perfectly timed. Gives a damn, another bureaucracy. Donald Trump broke the law.\\n\\nIt's not what it says. Donald Trump broke the law, they say. Well, if Donald Trump broke the law, as they point out in PJ Media today, well, then so did Joe Biden.\\n\\nRemember that billion dollars that Joe Biden said, hey, look, Ukraine, you're not getting that billion dollars unless you fire that prosecutor? Well, that billion dollars was appropriated by Congress in March, 2014 by a vote of 399-19 in the House, 98-2 in the Senate. And he tried to blackmail the Ukrainians and he tried to threaten withholding of funds. But where is the line that Joe Biden broke the law?\\n\\nNow, we have this guy, Lev Parnas. I told you, don't have a lot of time, but I'm moving. Who is Lev Parnas? Well, he is the latest guy that the Democrats are going to grab. He has been indicted on multiple felony counts. H is a foreigner who used foreign money and try to put foreign money into our campaign.\\n\\nNow, the Democrats want to hear from him and the media call it evidence. Evidence? Now, the media took here before with Michael Avenatti? Where is he today? His ass is in jail.\\n\\nRemember the porno star, Stormy Daniels? Where is she? No idea.\\n\\nMichal Cohen, remember him? He was going to bring down Trump on campaign charges. Where is he? He is in federal prison.\\n\\nNow, something funny about these two articles of impeachment. There is no constitutional violation. There is no statutory violation. There is no violation of a federal court order.\\n\\nThis is why they keep throwing up smoke. And I want to tell these five Republicans of the Senate, the weak links in the chain -- Romney, Collins, Murkowski, Gardner, and the other one skips my mind, luckily, Alexander.\\n\\nLet me tell you something. You have a duty to uphold the Constitution. What the House of representatives has done here is destroy the Constitution. It's your job to fix it. It's your job to stop them. Not aid and abet by calling witnesses that the Democrats want.\\n\\nNo. No witnesses. No witnesses. This should be dismissed. This is a disgrace. That's it.\\n\\nHANNITY: The one great one, Mark Levin. Sunday night, 8:00 p.m., right here, Fox News. Number one show Sunday night at 8:00 p.m.\\n\\nAnd up next, new reports, dark money group linked to AOC, spending money in the hopes of hurting Biden's campaign. Dan Bongino, Geraldo, straight ahead.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nHANNITY: All right. Here to react to all the left's hypocrisy, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, FOX News contributor, Dan Bongino.\\n\\nYou know, Geraldo, you've got to help me out here.\\n\\nGERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: OK.\\n\\nHANNITY: How do you get to the spot, and just totally ignore quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter. How does the left do that?\\n\\nRIVERA: Well, I don't think that they will be able to, Sean. If indeed they insist on calling witnesses, I think that Bidens are fair game. And once that starts unraveling -- you know, let me just say in a broader sense that the fact that Joe Biden is still the front runner is an indication of how weak the Democratic field is.\\n\\nI mean, with all due respect to the former vice president and the gaffes and all the rest of it, when you look at that field, that field -- there's no way on earth that they can stand toe-to-toe with the president. I think that's fueling the impeachment. But when I'm disappointed with, Sean, is that you failed to mention when you introduced me the fact that, you know, I have a robust life in terms of liking a drink now and then. I've been sober for a week, because I promised not to have a glass of alcohol until the president is acquitted, because I'm confident he will be. And the sooner, the better, so he can get the party back on.\\n\\nBut I think that Democrats --\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHANNITY: I've been out here, Geraldo.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nHANNITY: Selfie one night, Geraldo, out of those drinks, maybe it's a good thing.\\n\\nDan?\\n\\nDAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, listen, Sean, if this was any other prominent politician on tape like Joe Biden is on tape threatening to have a prosecutor fired who was in fact fired, was investigating his son, who had come as you adequately say, no experience to get this, what,\\n\\n$50,000 to $80,000 a job month, whatever it was, it's bad either way, in a country where his father is the point man connected to the Obama administration as his vice president, I mean, it would be an international scandal.\\n\\nThe fact that the media has downplayed this now, now that Joe Biden is running for president.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nHANNITY: Downplayed? They act as though nothing wrong happened.\\n\\nBONGINO: Yes, what's interesting about this is that they did cover it before Joe Biden started to run. Now that Joe Biden could potentially hurt Trump, now, all of a sudden, they want to bury it, which is even worse than never covering it at all.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nRIVERA: Sean, one thing, one point if I can -- you know, now that they've tried to implicate the Lev Parnes interview to implicate the vice president, so, they're going after the president, they're going after the vice president, guess who is president of the United States if they successfully remove the president and the vice president? Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nHANNITY: I'm getting the vapors.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHANNITY: Dan, that's frightening, right?\\n\\nBONGINO: It is frightening. I mean, Sean, listen, at some point, they're going to have to produce a victim in this case. Even the people Parnas is saying he told about this deal are on camera saying, I don't know what this guy is talking about. This is a crime with no victim.\\n\\nHANNITY: The foreign minister is saying don't believe a word this guy says.\\n\\nAll right, guys.\\n\\nWhen we come back, can't make this up, Humpty Dumpty, fake news CNN, low rated show, one of the lowest, a documentary of fake news. Wow. Straight ahead.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nHANNITY: All right. Fake news CNN's Humpty Dumpty announcing he's working with HBO on a documentary about fake news. Not a joke. Even Humpty Dumpty's friend, some guy assistant named Oliver whatever his name is, who thinks he knows me is tweeting, I may or may not be in this one. His aspiration, to be Humpty.\\n\\nAre they going to talk about CNN settling with Nicholas Sandmann, or their network had to correct multiple fake news stories about Russia collusion?\\n\\nDoubt it. If Humpty and his wannabe assistant want to expose bias journalism, watch your own network.\\n\\nLet not your heart be troubled.

{"original": "Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts blocked Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul from posing a question during the Senate impeachment trial Wednesday that would have named the alleged whistleblower at the center of the case, Fox News is told — and Paul may try to force the issue during the question-and-answer session that begins Thursday afternoon.\\n\\nRoberts, for now, has ball control because he actually receives the questions in note cards from senators, then reads the question aloud in the Senate chamber to be answered by either House Democratic managers or Trump's defense team. But Fox News has learned Roberts may soon lose his grip on the proceedings amid a torrent of criticism both inside and outside the Senate.\\n\\nThe Federalist co-founder Sean Davis condemned what he called Roberts' arbitrary and unilateral censorship of senators and Senate business, and reported that Roberts had initially sought to block even general questions of the intelligence community whistleblower. When Republicans threatened a vote rebuking and overriding Roberts, Davis reported, Roberts backed down and decided only to prohibit mentioning the whistleblower's name.\\n\\nA reporter for Roll Call observed that during a break in the trial Wednesday, Paul was fuming.\\n\\nI don't want to have to stand up to try and fight for recognition, Paul shouted, according to reporter Niels Lesniewski, who noted that Paul's complaint was audible from the galleries above the chamber.\\n\\nIf I have to fight for recognition, I will, Paul said.\\n\\nAsked by Fox News whether Paul, who has long raised concerns about possible intelligence community overreach, would press the issue during the upcoming question period, a spokesman for the senator told Fox News only, tbd -- short for to be determined. Last year, Paul was vocal about wanting testimony from the whistleblower on the record, as inconsistencies emerged in the whistleblower's claims.\\n\\nIf I have to fight for recognition, I will. — Kentucky GOP Rep. Rand Paul\\n\\nRoberts, under the Constitution, presides over the impeachment trial. But the precise contours of his authority are not clearly established, and remain up for debate; Democrats have even said they will attempt a long-shot motion to give Roberts the unprecedented power to approve or reject witnesses, for example.\\n\\n'GAME OVER': TRUMP DECLARES VICTORY AFTER BOLTON VIDEO EMERGES SHOWING HIM PRAISING UKRAINE CALL\\n\\nFederal law protects whistleblowers only from retaliation in the workplace, and does not ensure their anonymity; and Republicans have disputed whether this particular whistleblower would even qualify for those limited protections, saying his complaint concerns a policy dispute and does not allege criminal or civil wrongdoing by the president.\\n\\nRepublicans have sought more information on the whistleblower ever since the intelligence community's internal watchdog found several indicators that the person might have a political bias. Fox News has previously reported the whistleblower is a registered Democrat and had a prior work history with a senior Democrat running for president. Additionally, the whistleblower faces an ICIG complaint for allegedly violating federal law by raising money ostensibly to pay for his legal fees, including money that could be coming from from foreign sources.\\n\\nThe whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, openly admitted back in 2017 that a coup had started against the president from within the administration, and that CNN's coverage would play a key role in the effort.\\n\\nHe also openly solicited intelligence community members to help impeach and get rid of Trump, years before Trump's call with Urkaine's leader that triggered the current impeachment proceedings.\\n\\nAdditionally, Zaid acknowledged that the whistleblower had contact with a prominent Democratic presidential contender, amid reporters that he had served closely with Joe Biden when he was vice president. Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate Biden is at the center of the current probe.\\n\\nConspicuously, Democrats' lead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., has made public inconsistent statements concerning the House Intelligence Committee's contacts with the whistleblower. Schiff first denied that his panel had such contact, then reversed course and admitted that members of the committee had spoken to the whistleblower.\\n\\nSCHIFF, IN REVERSAL, ADMITS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HIS OWN CONTACT WITH THE WHISTLEBLOWER\\n\\nIt could be, Republicans have asserted, that the whistleblower coordinated his complaint with Schiff's panel for partisan reasons -- a disclosure that, if true, would likely undermine the credibility of the impeachment proceedings and possibly expose Schiff to his own abuse of power allegations. Thus far, the impeachment effort has arguably been elevated in importance from normal partisan bickering in part by the gravitas afforded to the supposedly well-meaning whistleblower at the center of the case.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Schiff again denied knowing the identity of the whistleblower, while Republicans accused him of deliberately lying. Schiff repeatedly shut down GOP questions during the House impeachment proceedings concerning White House leaks -- even though doing so at one point seemingly demonstrated that Schiff likely knew the whistleblower's identity.\\n\\nLietenant Colonel Vindman, did you discuss the July 25 phone call [between Trump and Ukraine's president] with anyone outside the White House on July 25 or the 26 and if so, with whom? Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes asked last year.\\n\\nGOP SEN ACCUSES DEM WITNESS OF CONSPIRING TO BRING DOWN TRUMP\\n\\nYes. I did, Vindman, who has also claimed not to know the whistleblower's identity, responded. He said he had spoken to Deputy Assistant Secretary George Kent but, before he could mention the other person, Schiff intervened and urgently blocked the questioning.\\n\\nWe need to protect the whistleblower, Schiff interjected. Please stop. I want to make sure that there is no effort to out the whistleblower through these proceedings. If the witness has a good faith belief that this may reveal the identity of the whistleblower, that is not the purpose that we're here for. I want to advise the witness accordingly.\\n\\n'COUP HAS STARTED,' UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER'S ATTORNEY PROMISED IN 2017, VOWING TO IMPEACH AND 'GET RID OF' TRUMP\\n\\nRoberts has mostly stayed out of the spotlight in the trial. In the first day of the proceedings, Roberts admonished both sides for misconduct in the chamber, saying their rhetoric had gotten too heated. That warning reportedly came after a stunned Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins passed a note to Roberts, following Democrats' claims that a vote against their witness resolution would amount to a coverup.\\n\\nDershowitz takes on Nadler, Schiff\\n\\nWednesday's lengthy question-and-answer session contained other notable moments, including another spirited constitutional argument by liberal Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz.\\n\\nMultiple media outlets, including CNN, mischaracterized Dershowitz throughout the day as saying that presidents can do anything as long as they can argue it's in the public interest. Additionally, several politicians, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., falsely claimed that Dershowitz argued Trump's conduct was OK.\\n\\nIn fact, Dershowitz maintained that criminal or criminal-like conduct is impeachable, regardless of its motivation. And he did not endorse Trump's behavior. Instead, Dershowitz asserted the Senate should not be in the business of removing elected presidents based on nebulous and unconstitutional abuse of power or obstruction of Congress charges that the framers expressly rejected.\\n\\nIt would be a standard Democrats would not want applied to their own presidents, he argued. (Neither abuse of power nor obstruction of Congress is a defined crime.)\\n\\nTo demonstrate that point, Dershowitz made thinly veiled references to President Obama's refusal to send lethal military aid to Ukraine, as well as his failed, unenforced red line warning for Syria not to use chemical weapons. Obama was also caught on a hot microphone promising Russia's president he would have more flexibility on missile defense issues after the 2012 election.\\n\\nLet's consider a hypothetical, Dershowitz said. Let's assume that President Obama had been told by his advisors that it really is important to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine. But then he gets a call from his pollster and his political adviser, who says we know it's in the national interest to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine, but we're telling you that the left-wing of your party is really going to give you a hard time if you start selling lethal weapons and potentially get into a lethal war with Russia. Would anybody here suggest that is impeachable?\\n\\nWATCH: DERSHOWITZ TURNS TO HOUSE DEMS, UNLOADS CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT IN DRAMATIC MOMENT AT IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\\n\\nHe continued: Or let's assume President Obama said, 'I promise to bomb Syria if they had chemical weapons. But I'm now told by my pollster that bombing Syria would hurt my electoral chances.' Simply not impeachable at all.\\n\\nIt would be difficult if not impossible, Dershowitz said, to determine that a president has acted with corrupt motive, given that countless presidents inevitably consider both the national interest and their personal political gain when making decisions. Rarely do presidents act with purely corrupt or purely noble motives, he said. Often, he went on, presidents want to help themselves but in doing so believe they are also helping the country.\\n\\nThere were signs Dershowitz's argument was making headway among moderate swing-vote GOP senators. Collins, R-Maine, was reportedly clearly unhappy with Democrats' explanation as to why they had not charged actual crimes in the articles of impeachment, and was shaking her head while they answered her question on the topic by claiming their allegations were akin to criminal conduct, Roll Call's Todd Ruger reported.\\n\\nWhen House Democratic impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed all scholars except for Dershowitz agreed that impeachment didn't have to involve crimes or criminal-like conduct, there were audible groans from the GOP side of the chamber.\\n\\nDershowitz rose, turned to Nadler, and said he was simply ignorant of the facts.\\n\\nBy the way, the congressman was just completely wrong when he said I'm the only scholar who supports this position, Dershowitz said. In the 19th century, which is much closer in time [to the founding of the country and the drafting of the Constitution,] Dean [Theodore] Dwight of the Columbia Law School wrote that 'the weight of authority,' by which he meant the weight of scholarly and judicial authority, this is in 1867, is in favor of requiring a crime. Justice [Benjamin Robbins] Curtis came to the same conclusion.\\n\\nDershowitz reiterated that the abuse of power charge was vague and indeterminate, and was precisely the kind of article of impeachment that the framers wanted to reject -- as evidenced by their explicit repudiation of the charge of maladministration,' which he said is synonymous with abuse or misconduct in office.\\n\\nHe then took a shot at fellow Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe for being a partisan hack, and warned that scholars often have partisan biases, too. Dershowitz noted that he voted for Hillary Clinton and would be making the same argument if she were on trial.\\n\\nLater, Dershowitz deployed another hypothetical to argue that Democrats' impeachment was itself, somewhat ironically, a partisan proceeding. That Biden was running for president, Dershowitz said, in fact gave Trump a plausible public policy justification for seeking a probe into possible corruption by the former vice president while in office.\\n\\nLet's assume hypothetically that the president was in his second term and he said to himself, you know, Joe Biden is running for president, Dershowitz said. I really should now be concerned about whether his son is corrupt, because he's not only a candidate ... but he could be the President of the United States, and if he's the president of the United States and he has a corrupt son, the fact that he's announced his candidacy is a very good reason for upping the interest in his son.\\n\\nWHOOPS: BIDEN CAMP TOUTS UKRAINE ACTIVIST WHO CALLED HUNTER BIDEN'S ACTION'S THERE 'VERY BAD'\\n\\nDershowitz continued: If he wasn't running for president, he's a has-been. He is the former vice president of the United States. Okay, big deal. But if he's running for president, that's an enormous big deal. So the difference the House managers would make is whether the president's in his first term or his second term, whether he's running for reelection or not running for reelection. I think they would have to concede that if he was not running for reelection, this would not be a corrupt motive, or it would be a mixed motive, but leaning on the side of national interest. If he is running for reelection, suddenly that turns it into an impeachable offense!\\n\\nSchiff rose to claim that Republicans surely would have impeached Obama if he sought to tie financial aid to a foreign country to secure a probe into Mitt Romney; he did not address Dershowitz's argument that such an impeachment, too, would be improper, especially if there was some evidence of potential overseas misconduct by Romney.\\n\\nTrump declares 'GAME OVER'\\n\\nA string of newly resurfaced video clips of former national security adviser John Bolton spurred Trump and his supporters Wednesday to highlight what they described as Bolton's serious credibility questions amid the Senate impeachment trial, as the president tweeted, GAME OVER!\\n\\nIn his tweet, Trump linked to an interview of Bolton in August 2019 where he discusses Ukraine policy. In the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty interview clip, Bolton made no mention of any illicit quid pro quo, and acknowledged, as Republicans have claimed, that combating corruption in Ukraine was a high priority for the Trump administration.\\n\\nBolton also called Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warm and cordial, without mentioning any misconduct. It seemingly contradicted reported assertions in Bolton's forthcoming book that Trump explicitly told him he wanted to tie military aid to Ukraine to an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. (Zelensky has said his communications with Trump involved no pressure for any investigation.)\\n\\nFox News later identified clips of Schiff, D-Calif., now the lead House impeachment manager, in which he says Bolton had a distinct lack of credibility and was prone to conspiracy theories. This week, Schiff said Bolton needed to testify in the impeachment trial as an important and believable witness.\\n\\nWHITE HOUSE TELLS BOLTON TO REMOVE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED MATERIALS FROM MANUSCRIPT, THROWING TESTIMONY INTO DOUBT\\n\\nThis is someone who's likely to exaggerate the dangerous impulses of the president toward belligerence, his proclivity to act without thinking, and his love of conspiracy theories, Schiff told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on March 22, 2018, when Trump named Bolton national security adviser.\\n\\nAnd I'll, you know, just add one data point to what you were talking about earlier, John Bolton once suggested on Fox News that the Russian hack of the DNC [Democratic National Committee] was a false flag operation that had been conducted by the Obama administration, he said. So, you add that kind of thinking to [former U.S. attorney] Joe diGenova and you have another big dose of unreality in the White House.\\n\\nSchiff made similar arguments back in May 2005, saying in an interview with CNN's Crossfire that Bolton was more focused on the next job than doing well at the last job when he was up for nomination as ambassador to the United Nations under then-President George W. Bush.\\n\\nAnd particularly given the history, where we've had the politicizing of intelligence over WMD [weapons of mass destruction], why we would pick someone who the very same issue has been raised repeatedly, and that is John Bolton's politicization of the intelligence he got on Cuba and other issues, why we would want someone with that lack of credibility, I can't understand, Schiff had said.\\n\\nBolton himself had admitted in the past that he would be more than willing to lie if he felt it was in the nation's best interest.\\n\\nIf I had to say something I knew was false to protect American national security, I would do it, Bolton said in an interview with Fox Business in 2010.\\n\\nBut, speaking to CNN on Monday, Schiff took a different approach -- calling Bolton essential to the search for truth.\\n\\nI think for the senators, and I'm just not talking about the four that have been so much the focus of attention, for every senator, Democrat and Republican, I don't know how you can explain that you wanted a search for the truth in this trial and say you don't want to hear from a witness who had a direct conversation about the central allegation in the articles of impeachment, Schiff said on CNN's New Day.\\n\\nWHITE HOUSE TELLS BOLTON TO REMOVE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED MATERIALS FROM MANUSCRIPT, THROWING TESTIMONY INTO DOUBT\\n\\nSeemingly responding to charges of hypocrisy, Schiff remarked on the Senate floor late Wednesday: I'm no fan of John Bolton, but I like him a little more now than I used to.\\n\\nWitnesses up in the air\\n\\nWhether or not the Senate will vote to call Bolton as a witness -- or whether he will legally be able to testify -- remain open questions. Enthusiasm on Captiol Hill for Bolton's testimony dampened somewhat following Trump's release of the GAME OVER! clip.\\n\\nRepublicans have suggested that Schiff himself, and Hunter Biden, should testify, if Democrats insist on Bolton.\\n\\nAnd, Republicans have argued that Democrats should not need additional witnesses, if they truly believe that their case is overwhelming and already proven beyond any doubt, as Nadler and other Democratic impeachment managers have said.\\n\\nAny witness resolution would likely require four Republican defections in the Senate, because in the event of a 50-50 tie, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts is highly likely to abstain rather than assert his debatable power to cast a tie-breaking vote.\\n\\nThe witness question will be decided later this week, after the question-and-answer session of the trial wraps up.\\n\\nRepublicans, who have a 53-47 majority in the chamber, have suggested to Fox News that they would amend any witness resolution that subpoenas Bolton to also require the appearance of several additional witnesses favorable to the Trump administration -- likely killing support in the Senate for the whole witness package altogether.\\n\\nRepublicans have also pointed out that in the House, Democrats approved mostly Democratic witnesses, and afforded few to their GOP colleagues. In the Senate, some commentators have argued, it would be fair play to tilt the ratio in the other direction.\\n\\nIn the meantime, concerns over Bolton potentially divulging classified information, as well as violating the legal principle of executive privilege, have emerged. On Wednesday, the White House revealed it had told Bolton not to publish his upcoming tell-all book about his time in the Trump administration until classified material is removed from the manuscript.\\n\\nUnder federal law and the nondisclosure agreements your client signed as a condition for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information, Ellen J. Knight, a National Security Council (NSC) aide, wrote in a letter to Bolton attorney Charles J. Cooper last week, which was obtained by Fox News.\\n\\nBolton's book has disrupted Trump's impeachment trial. The New York Times reported that Bolton's draft manuscript includes a claim that Trump explicitly linked a hold on military aid to Ukraine to an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden -- a central part of the case against Trump.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe letter from the NSC was transmitted to Bolton's attorney on Jan 23. The New York Times article about the manuscript came out on Sunday, Jan. 26 -- three days after the letter was transmitted. That indicates that the NSC had already made the determination that there was top secret information in Bolton's manuscript before anything became public.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, CNN reported that the letter amounted to a threat against Bolton. But sources told Fox News this was not a threat, saying the letter merely points out that there is top secret information contained in the manuscript that cannot be released to the public.\\n\\nFox News' Chad Pergram and Sally Persons contributed to this report."}

{"original": "Following the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the Senate Judiciary Committee referred several of his accusers to the Justice Department for lying to Congress, reminding us that the importance of taking accusations of sexual assault seriously must be balanced with a presumption of innocence for the accused.\\n\\nIt is precisely that balance that the U.S. Department of Education was aiming for when it recently proposed rules, under its Title IX authority, governing how institutions of higher education and K-12 schools handle students' accusations of sexual misconduct.\\n\\nThe overarching goal of the rules, which will have the biggest impact on college campuses, was articulated by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos: Every survivor of sexual violence must be taken seriously, and every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM CURT LEVEY.\\n\\nThe proposed rules, which will become final after a 60-day public comment period that will likely result in some revisions, are intended to replace seriously-flawed Obama administration guidance on the same subject. That guidance, issued without public input, gave accused students—nearly always male and, as journalist Emily Yoffe has documented in The Atlantic, disproportionately black—little opportunity to defend themselves despite possible expulsion, rescission of job offers and graduate school admission, and other career-damaging consequences.\\n\\nThe Obama era guidance was the result of lobbying by liberal activists who portray sexual assault on campus as an exploding crisis and insist that all accusers must be believed, while dismissing inconsistencies or untruths in an accuser's story as the understandable result of trauma - a theme that should sound familiar to those who followed the Kavanaugh saga. The guidance pressured schools to deny basic due process protections to the accused, while also mandating the lowest possible standard of proof—under which a 50 percent chance of guilt means conviction—and defining sexual misconduct so broadly that it infringed on free speech.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAmong the many due process rights commonly denied to accused students were cross-examination of the accuser and other witnesses, which the Obama administration worried could be traumatic or intimidating, and access to exculpatory evidence and the details of the charges. More than 200 such students fought back with lawsuits against their schools. In fact, the success of many of these suits is one reason Secretary DeVos made replacement of the Obama guidance a priority.\\n\\nHer proposed rules require schools to respond to any report of sexual misconduct and to investigate every complaint filed, while at the same time correcting the overbreadth problem in the definition of covered conduct and, most importantly, adding much needed due process requirements. These include written notice of the allegations, an opportunity for both parties to review the evidence, the presumption of innocence, the right of cross-examination—subject to the typical rape shield exceptions—and an end to the common practice of having a single school official serve as investigator, judge, and jury.\\n\\nHer proposed rules require schools to respond to any report of sexual misconduct and to investigate every complaint filed, while at the same time correcting the overbreadth problem in the definition of covered conduct and, most importantly, adding much needed due process requirements.\\n\\nThe new rules would also allow, but not require, schools to apply the somewhat higher clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. Given the severity of the consequences for students found guilty, many critics of campus kangaroo courts would have liked to have seen the rules also allow the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, the one used in the criminal justice system, where non-student claims of sexual assault are normally adjudicated.\\n\\nOne might hope that these common-sense reforms would meet with less resistance from the left than other Trump administration policies, given liberals' championing of due process protections for even enemy combatants and non-citizens residing unlawfully in the U.S. Instead, the Chronicle of Higher Education reports that Reaction to the regulations was swift, with ranking Democrats in the House and Senate condemning the proposals. A typical response was that of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who tweeted that DeVos was siding with predators over survivors …betray[ing] her responsibility to the students she's meant to serve. It's sickening.\\n\\nSen. Gillibrand and her like-minded colleagues fail to understand that only a fair adjudication process can determine who is the predator and who is the survivor, that DeVos is meant to serve male as well as female students—as is Gillibrand by the way—and that ruining the life of a wrongly accused student is as sickening as an unpunished sexual assault. Yoffe reports that she has yet to talk to an accused student, even one who was eventually cleared, whose life wasn't profoundly damaged; every one has told me that at some point he considered suicide.\\n\\nThe reaction of liberal activists outside Congress was similar. These changes are designed to flip Title IX on its head and give rights to accused students when Title IX was supposed to be protecting those experiencing sexual discrimination, said Carly Mee, an attorney for a survivors advocacy group SurvJustice. Putting aside Mee's mistaken belief that Title IX protects only accusers, it is a shame that critics of the proposed rules see the investigation and adjudication of sexual assault allegations as a choice between protecting women and affording due process to the accused.\\n\\nAs Secretary DeVos points out, there is nothing inconsistent with a policy that both strongly condemns and punishes sexual misconduct and ensures a fair adjudicatory process.

{"original": "Several Angel parents -- the mothers and fathers of U.S. citizens killed by illegal immigrants -- are accusing top Democrats of being out of touch with regular America after they claimed President Trump is manufacturing a crisis at the border to win support for the construction of his long-promised wall.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Ca., used the 'manufacturing' language Tuesday night during their tag-team rebuttal to Trump's Oval Office address -- his first ever -- on border security. The Democratic duo argued the president was merely trying to strike fear into the hearts of Americans in an attempt to get his central campaign promise across the finish line. But that spin didn't sit well with those who've lost loved ones due to illegal immigration.\\n\\nTRUMP LAMENTS 'CRISIS' IN OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS\\n\\nI'm just wondering if Nancy Pelosi had one of her children or grandchildren assaulted in the same way that my son was assassinated if she would speak the same way. I just wonder about that, Jeffrey Mazin, the father of Alexander Mazin, told Fox News' 'The Ingraham Angle'.\\n\\nAS TRUMP HEADS TO BORDER, DEMOCRATS DOUBLE DOWN ON 'MANUFACTURED CRISIS' CLAIM\\n\\nAlexander Mazin, 27, was shot and killed at a gym parking lot in San Diego in February last year. The suspected shooter, Ernesto Castellanos Martinez, is reported to be the ex-boyfriend of the woman Mazin had recently started dating. Martinez, investigators say, is also a twice-deported illegal immigrant who has since fled to Mexico.\\n\\nThe man straddled him and pumped four more bullets into his chest. My son died there in the parking lot, like a rat in the street, his father told Fox News last year. Obviously every time I tell it, the emotion pours out of me.\\n\\nJulie Golvach, the mother of Spencer Golvach – who was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant at a traffic light in Houston in 2015 – also told Fox News that Schumer and Pelosi's comments struck a nerve.\\n\\nIt may seem 'manufactured' to them because they are sitting safely behind walls, but for those of us out in regular America, we are victims, we are prone to the victimization of illegal aliens and crime, she said on 'Fox & Friends' Wednesday morning.\\n\\nPelosi, who delivered the first part of the Democratic rebuttal Tuesday night, said Americans all agree that we need to secure our borders while honoring our values.\\n\\nBut she added: the fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge – a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened. And the fact is: President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.\\n\\nPELOSI, SCHUMER ACCUSE TRUMP OF SPREADING 'MISINFORMATION', 'MALICE' IN OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS\\n\\nSchumer, in his remarks, echoed Pelosi in tone and substance, saying first that Democrats and the President both want stronger border security, before noting we sharply disagree with the President about the most effective way to do it.\\n\\nSchumer also reiterated calls to end the ongoing partial government shutdown and accused Trump of using the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his Administration.\\n\\nTrump, in a speech focused on what he described as a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border, appeared to reference parents such as Mazin and Golvach. Trump interacted with Angel parents frequently while he was campaigning for the White House, often invoking their departed sons and daughters during speeches and speaking about the parents on a first-name basis. His Tuesday remarks were delivered in a similar spirit.\\n\\nFor those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken, he said.

{"original": "Washington is literally at a standstill over the funding for a wall on the United States southern border. Putting aside the politics behind the gridlock for the moment, the substance of the debate hinges less on the need for border security and more on differing claims about the effectiveness of such a wall. President Trump has claimed a wall would be 99.9 percent effective at stopping illegal immigration while leading Democrats argue a border wall is unnecessary and would be ineffective. And so it may be worth stepping back from the politics of the day to view walls in their historical context. After all, states have been building walls since ancient times. Some were arguably quite successful, others less so. At the core of prudent policy lies a basic question: What can walls realistically accomplish?\\n\\nHistorically, walls were used to keep invaders out. The early Chinese states built what has become known as the Great Wall to protect themselves against the nomadic groups of the Steppes. Roman Emperor Hadrian constructed a wall across the British isle separating the Roman domain from troublesome northern tribes. More recently, Israel has employed several walls—along the West Bank and Gaza, as well as along its northern and southern borders, to protect itself from terrorism, smuggling, illegal immigration and other threats.\\n\\nAuthoritarian regimes have used walls to keep their populations in. During the Cold War, the communist German Democratic Republic constructed the Berlin Wall to separate East Berlin from West Berlin at least as much to keep their own residents in as their Western foes out. The same may be true of the barriers along the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula, which, in addition to its military function, serves to keep North Koreans from defecting.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE ON THIS TOPIC IN FOX NEWS OPINION\\n\\nMore recently, walls have been used to keep warring populations separated. Walls have long been a staple of counterinsurgency. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the British emplaced the so-called peace walls in Belfast to separate Republican Catholic neighborhoods from Loyalist Protestant ones in an effort to tamp down sectarian violence. Similarly, during the Iraq War, the United States military relied extensively on giant concrete barrier walls both to combat the improvised explosive device threat and later to help isolate sectarian hot spots, making concrete barriers one of the unsung heroes of the so-called Surge.\\n\\nNo matter their original purpose, some basic principles behind walls remain timeless. Walls do work, at least for a time. There is a reason, after all, why states across the centuries have turned to walls as solutions to strategic quagmires. As mentioned before, walls have proven notably effective in places like Iraq in tamping down violence. That said, walls also have a shelf-life. In military parlance, walls are delaying obstacles. They can slow down the attacker and in best-case scenarios deter them from attacking in the first place by making the effort not worth the reward. But no historical wall has proven impregnable. Determined adversaries have been able to breach them or tunnel under them in time. Despite Israel's technological edge, Hamas has infiltrated under the walls around Gaza. North Korea was able to tunnel into the demilitarized zone toward South Korea, despite it being one of the most fortified areas of the world.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nPartly because walls are only a delaying obstacle, building them is only half the issue. After their construction, they need to be constantly monitored—often the harder task, even with advanced technology. In this sense, the Israeli effort around Gaza is particularly instructive. The Israeli-Gaza border after all is comparatively tiny, about 60 kilometers or less than a fiftieth the length of United States-Mexican border, and the Israelis still need to devote ample technological resources and manpower to watching it. And even so, these walls have not been foolproof.\\n\\nWalls sometimes can create new ethical dilemmas. Walls can become the focal point for conflict. A recent example of this occurred when Palestinians—some of them armed—protested near the Gaza wall for seven months beginning in March. While accounts vary, human rights groups place the number of casualties at over 5,800 injured and 180 killed. Even in less extreme cases, walls—especially in populated areas—may disrupt trade and the free flow of people, inflicting a cost on the local population.\\n\\nIf the United States does indeed build a wall along its southern border and then monitors it effectively, it may succeed in curbing illegal immigration, but it will not end it. Walls cannot prevent people from overstaying their visas or being smuggled in another way. And if history is any precedent, illegal immigrants may attempt to tunnel under the wall, go over it or breach it some other way.\\n\\nFinally, walls are a tactic (if, at times, a critical one), but ultimately, not a strategy. Because they can provide immediate relief to the problems at hand, walls can buy decisionmakers the time and political space they need for other instruments of power to work, and for those tools to prove decisive. In this sense, walls can enable victory, but rarely are the reason for it. The Troubles in Ireland came to an end through negotiation and ultimately through a diplomatic accord. The Surge reduced violence in Iraq partially by co-opting Sunni insurgents. And some Israeli policymakers attribute the relative peace in the West Bank compared to Gaza—despite both having walls—at least in part to the West Bank's continued economic growth.\\n\\nIf the United States does indeed build a wall along its southern border and then monitors it effectively, it may succeed in curbing illegal immigration, but it will not end it. Walls cannot prevent people from overstaying their visas or being smuggled in another way. And if history is any precedent, illegal immigrants may attempt to tunnel under the wall, go over it or breach it some other way.\\n\\nAs long as life in the United States offers potential migrants more opportunities and fewer perceived dangers than their home countries, illegal immigration will likely persist.\\n\\nIf a border wall provides the political space for addressing these more systemic problems, then it may still be a worthwhile investment. That said, the proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border—like all previous walls —should be viewed as a means to an end, rather than an end unto itself."}

Lewis, On living in an atomic age, 1948.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE STORY OF THE GREAT REPUBLICAN CRACKUP\\n\\nIt's amazing to write, but the biggest political story in Georgia today is not about Tuesday's white-knuckle, two-seat runoff election with control of the Senate on the line.\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead, it is a recording of President Trump badgering the state's elections chief to swipe Georgia's electoral votes for him.\\n\\n\\n\\nOr, as Trump might characterize it, swipe them back.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a leaked recording of a weekend call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the president tells Raffensperger to find just one more vote than needed to reverse President-elect Joe Biden's 11,779-vote Georgia victory.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump told Raffensperger – who rejected the demand – that such corruption is merited because he really won the state by hundreds of thousands of votes.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe claim is, of course, hogwash. But the fact that Trump is still trying so hard to filch a second term and the fact that so many Republicans are still playing along despite Trump's conduct is one of the biggest stories of the century so far.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Trump is doing with the help of many members of his party is certainly the most historically significant part of his presidency – more than an impeachment, more than judicial appointments or any piece of policy. It is unprecedented and deals with matters central to the survival of the republic\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is truly Trump's legacy project, and its disposition will have a great deal to say about the future of a badly divided Republican Party and also our capacity as Americans for self-governance in the era of brain-dead partisanship and easy disinformation.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe've tried not to spend too much time on the flapdoodle of Trump's attempts. They may be significant for history taken as a whole but they are crushingly boring and mostly irrelevant as a matter of day-to-day news.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump team: Everyone is ignoring the massive fraud that destroyed our democracy!!!!!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\nJustices/judges/law enforcement/elections officials: Whoa! We're all ears! Please show us the evidence!\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump team: Trump was winning and then they kept counting votes and then he lost.\\n\\n\\n\\nJustices/judges/law enforcement/elections officials: Ah! That's because some states counted mail-in ballots last, and Democrats dominated among mail-in voters. Because of the pandemic, there were lots more mail-in votes this year. You're claiming fraud. You need proof of fraud.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump team: *shuffles papers and mumbles* Your demand PROVES that you are part of the Chinese Communist effort to destroy America. Do what we want or we will destroy you!!!!\\n\\n\\n\\nJustices/judges/law enforcement/elections officials: K bye.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has been the equivalent of a two-month-long Michael Avenatti interview and just as painful to endure. #basta\\n\\n\\n\\nBut with Trump on tape trying to bully an elected official into fabricating an election result and senators falling all over themselves to join Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley in turning Wednesday's congressional certification of results into reality television, it seems like today is the time to slip on our hazmat suit and get into it.\\n\\n\\n\\nFox News has lots of great coverage of the Georgia runoffs ahead of Tuesday's conclusion (though the actual counting may go on much longer – sorry) and we will be back before the polls close with our full analysis of the race. If you'd like some great context and deep background, Chris joined Abby Hornacek on her latest Getting Schooled podcast to talk about the peculiar history and details of this week's runoffs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe two subjects are certainly intertwined. If Republicans do manage to lose the Senate in Georgia, Trump's desperate bid to cling to power and the efforts by Republicans to help him will be the main reason.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe key swing voters in Georgia are those mostly-affluent suburbanites who split their votes between Biden for president and the Republican Senate candidates. If the purpose of having a Republican Senate is to support Trump, even to the point of this absurdity, then those folks won't really want a Republican Senate. In fact, they might want to send a message to the GOP about the way their senators have been behaving.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdd in those poor souls who really believe Trump's claims of massive, uncorrected, systemic electoral fraud who decide not to vote and you have created the only conditions under which Republicans really could lose the Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump has promised to bring lots of new allegations of misconduct against Georgia's elections officials to his rally tonight in Dalton, a small city just across the border from Chattanooga in a county where Trump won 70 percent of the vote.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe can imagine that in the wake of Sunday's revelations, Trump's attacks on the electoral system will be even more intense than in his December rally.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's a long way of saying: please enjoy the thread below which aims to trace the arc of the Republican meltdown and what it may portend. We think you'll get something out of it and, hey, you can at least say it was worth the price.\\n\\n\\n\\nSee you Tuesday with the nitty gritty on Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\\nBackbone backfire - Pity poor James Lankford, the unlikeliest member of the Senate's new election deflection brigade. His sudden and deep dive into the realm of the Kraken is quite reflective of how this mania spread in the GOP.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe junior senator from Oklahoma is up for re-election next year in a state Trump just carried by 33 points. But on Nov. 11, Republican Lankford did something the president very much did not like.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Lankford did not say the truth that Joe Biden had won the presidency, he did say that Biden needed to start receiving intelligence briefings immediately as part of a potential transition.\\n\\n\\n\\nLankford, a member of the committee with oversight of the agency that facilitates presidential transitions, said on Tulsa talk radio: I will step in as well to be able to push to say: 'This needs to occur.' So that regardless of the outcome of the election — whichever way that it goes — people can be ready for that actual task.\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite having been in the Senate for only five years, Lankford was esteemed among his colleagues. He replaced the legendary Tom Coburn and seemed to be growing into the job. In addition to his perch on Homeland Security and other high-profile committees, Lankford was chosen to be the chairman of the ethics committee.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo perhaps he didn't think it would be such a big deal that he would say Biden should be briefed. After all, Lankford had gently criticized Trump's Lafayette Park Bible brandishing photo-op in June and seemed to have suffered little for the president's rebuke.\\n\\n\\n\\nLankford was unlucky, this time, though. While other Republican senators would soon make less ambiguous statements about the need to get on with an orderly transition, Lankford's hit just before the wave crested and so got lots of coverage from reporters looking for evidence of a Trump-Senate GOP split.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike many Republicans, Lankford may have assumed that after Trump had used up his legal options for contesting the election that things would die down. What they did not know was that Trump was not running a legal effort, but rather another campaign.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe brunt of that campaign came down on Lankford and the senator soon buckled. Five days after saying that the matter needed to be resolved immediately, Lankford said he was not in a hurry to get Biden briefed.\\n\\n\\n\\nOof.\\n\\n\\n\\nLankford must have heard the drooling of his potential primary challengers. If a major question for primaries in states like Oklahoma next year will be how abject one's support for the former president has been, Lankford has trouble. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, for example, is about as abject as they come.\\n\\n\\n\\nBy allowing that Biden might win and saying that he would push the Trump administration, Lankford plopped himself in the prone position before the onrushing mass hysteria that grips the populist right.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that is how Lankford, once the boy wonder of the Boehnerite faction of the House GOP and up-and-comer of Mitch McConnell's Senate squad, ended up signing on to Cruz's radical effort to subvert the election.\\n\\n\\n\\nFailing forward - Not that it will succeed. Like a lot of the chicanery we've seen in Trump's effort to cling to power, Cruz's bid relies on the knowledge of its participants that it will fail.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's one thing to attempt to overturn an election for the sake of staging a made-for-TV spectacle on Wednesday, but neither Lankford nor any of the notorious self-promoters on Team Cruz would do it if it might actually work. None would want to be remembered by history as having precipitated what would surely be the worst crisis since the Civil War.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is only par for Cruz, whom many Americans first got to know as the architect of the bogus 2013 defund ObamaCare government shutdown. Then he succored Trump's 2016 candidacy when he thought it would benefit him but concluded his doomed run lashed up with John Kasich and Carly Fiorina in a desperate, goofball bid to block Trump. The guy who told delegates in Cleveland that year to vote your conscience may have abrogated his former views, but never his ambition.\\n\\n\\n\\nCruz, six other senators and four senators-elect have joined together to demand that Congress select a commission to perform a 10-day emergency audit of the election results and present its findings to state legislatures just a few days before the Jan. 20 inauguration so they could select new electors and strip Biden of the presidency.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnless their demands are met (which they won't be) Cruz, & Co. say they will vote against certifying the votes of disputed electors (of which there are none).\\n\\n\\n\\nBy procedural rules, though, their votes will trigger two hours of debate per contested state. That will allow Trump's supporters to repeat their thoroughly debunked claims.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, like Cruz's Green Eggs and Ham quasi-filibuster, the content is almost immaterial. The platform is the point. And for, say, a senator thinking of a presidential comeback or one being hounded by a mob back home, it would be invaluable.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, the consequences of this bit of keister covering will far outlast the fears and desires of its perpetrators.\\n\\n\\n\\nCivil War re-enactors - Unlike his possible 2024 presidential rival, Hawley, Cruz did not want to be so obvious in declaring his move a publicity stunt. So Cruz dressed it up with a proposal based on the electoral crisis of the fall and winter of 1876-1877.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the election of 1876, former Confederates finally had enough power to brutally crack down on the Black voters in the South – the beginning of a nearly century-long effort to deny African-Americans the vote. That year, in three states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – Republican elections boards threw out results they said were de-legitimated by terrorism.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs a result, officials in the three states each sent two slates of electoral votes to Congress: One intentionally inaccurate, the other accurate but the result of brutal coercion. Lawmakers deadlocked. The Democrat-controlled House backed their man, New York Gov. Samuel Tilden, and the Republican Senate stood strong for theirs, Ohio Gov. Rutherford Hayes. That left 20 electoral votes in limbo and the presidency dangling by a thread.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the big difference between then and now. All of the states have submitted their electoral votes and there is no dispute. That is not to say that there is no disagreement about the results, but there is no dispute in terms of the findings of the states.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivate citizens have opinions. Individual lawmakers have opinions. But in America, the states conduct elections, the results of which are confirmed by designated officials. Congress has no role in conducting elections, only in verifying that the results are official.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe official findings are complete and Biden won with 306 electoral votes. Congress has no power to change that.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn fact, rules like the safe harbor provision that helped conscientious lawmakers, officials and judges get to this point despite unprecedented efforts to subvert the results are the product of a law passed in the wake of the 1876 nightmare to prevent a repeat.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlaying with fire - Tilden or blood was the cry of the Democrats that year. If Congress did not give the presidency to Tilden, who had also won the popular vote, then Democrats said the sons of the South would be ready to resume hostilities against the Union.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt may have been a hollow threat given the devastated condition of the former Confederacy, but for a nation still traumatized by war in ways we can't imagine, it was enough.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe commission that Cruz & Co. say they would like to emulate was not for election investigation but rather for trying to find a solution for the deadlock and save a country splitting at the seams. Its members eventually voted eight to seven to award the disputed votes, and the presidency, to Hayes.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut Democrats had only dropped their threat to blockade the result after Hayes had agreed to pull the remaining federal troops out of the South. By then, there were just two significant garrisons in the former Confederacy. They were there to protect the duly elected governments of South Carolina and Louisiana from terrorists.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, knowing that he would not have the power in a divided government to do much more to protect Black Americans in the South anyway, Hayes capitulated and agreed to pull the troops out and let the terrorists drive Black lawmakers from power. So began a decades-long reign of terror and its lasting shame.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe resolution of the 1876 election was a disaster and the start of a dreadful period of American history. That Cruz would invoke it now as a model would be shabby enough even without his attack on one of the central pillars of federalism: state control of elections. These new nationalists really do mean business.\\n\\n\\n\\nLeaders 144 years ago were trying to find a way to resolve an inconclusive election without setting off another civil war. If these senators really were sincere in trying to do more than play political games, this would be the reverse.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's what you get - What Trump and his posse are hoping for on Wednesday is to have two mobs protesting the results: one in Congress and one outside in a promised wild rally of Trump supporters.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis will be the second consecutive transition that will be marked by mass protests. Like their pussycat-hat-wearing counterparts in the anti-Trump march of 2017, the red hats of 2021 want the world to know that the new president is not legitimate.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese kinds of mass demonstrations around the outcomes of elections are out of character for Americans. This is what you get in places where elections are not free and fair or where strongmen rule.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn historical terms, elections in our era are cleaner than they have ever been. Fraud is much, much harder than it was in the bad old days of political machines and stuffed ballot boxes. The degree of scrutiny and oversight far, far surpasses anything our parents or grandparents would have known.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd yet, voters increasingly believe they are rigged. That inverse correlation is the work of Trump, yes, but also of a coterie of folks across the political spectrum willing to exploit ignorance and fear for the sake of immediate gains – to survive a primary, to get clicks, to gain an advantage on rivals.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe American system survives because most citizens and most elected officials are holding the line. But it is reasonable to expect that work is going to get harder because of the recklessness of radicals.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf we have to repeat this misery in 2024, can we count on so many lawmakers, officials and judges to stand up to the threats of a sore loser of their own party? One would hope, but one would also assume that intervening primary elections will continue to punish individuals that prize propriety over party.\\n\\n\\n\\nLike Lankford, many will find that no resistance will be tolerated. Like Cruz, many others will find that there are significant advantages to be had in not just joining, but seeming to lead the parade.\\n\\n\\n\\nWill some future Congress cross the line from crass pandering and into the actual work of stealing an election? Will the results of some future election be decided not by counting ballots but by the partisan composition of statehouses? Will courts one day cower from angry mobs outside their chambers?\\n\\n\\n\\nThose things are not the likely outcomes in our near future. We hold fast to our belief that Americans tend to reject excesses in our leaders and that the pendulum will swing away from angry populism of the left and right. But it is certainly a possible future that could unfold in our lifetimes.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo decades from now, those of us still on this side of the sod will have a chance to reflect on the events of the fall and winter of 2020-2021. Will we say that Trump set a precedent that his successors followed? Will we say that the backlash against such efforts activated our small-r republican immune system against demagoguery?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe answers to those questions won't come on Wednesday or on Jan. 20. But how we as a people answer them in the years to come will determine whether America can endure in the Founders' vision and meet the duties that come with our privileged place in history.\\n\\n\\n\\nFellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We -- even we here -- hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. – President Abraham Lincoln in a message to Congress, Dec. 1, 1862\\n\\n\\n\\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.

A resumption of 20% enrichment could see that brinksmanship return.\\n\\nEven Ali Akbar Salehi, the U.S.-educated head of the civilian Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, offered a military analogy to describe his agency's readiness to take the next step.\\n\\nWe are like soldiers and our fingers are on the triggers, Salehi told Iranian state television. The commander should command and we shoot. We are ready for this and will produce (20% enriched uranium) as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe White House had no immediate comment and referred to a statement issued in December by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after Iran's parliament passed a bill on increasing uranium enrichment. Pompeo condemned the law as nothing more than the regime's latest ploy to use its nuclear program to try to intimidate the international community.\\n\\nA spokesman for President-elect Joe Biden's transition team declined to comment.\\n\\nIran's decision comes after its parliament passed a bill, later approved by a constitutional watchdog, aimed at hiking enrichment to pressure Europe into providing sanctions relief. It also serves as pressure ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Biden, who has said he is willing to re-enter the nuclear deal.\\n\\nTRUMP, OTHERS LINKED TO SOLEIMANI KILLING 'WILL NOT BE SAFE ON EARTH,' IRAN OFFICIAL WARNS\\n\\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency acknowledged Iran had informed its inspectors of the decision by a letter after news leaked overnight Friday.\\n\\nIran has informed the agency that in order to comply with a legal act recently passed by the country's parliament, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran intends to produce low-enriched uranium ... up to 20 percent at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, the IAEA said in a statement.\\n\\nThe IAEA added Iran did not say when it planned to boost enrichment, though the agency has inspectors present in Iran on a 24/7 basis and they have regular access to Fordo. The parliamentary bill also called on Iran to expel those inspectors, though it appears Tehran still hasn't decided to take that step.\\n\\nSalehi said Iran would need to switch out natural uranium in centrifuges at Fordo for material already enriched to 4% to begin the process of going to 20%.\\n\\nIt should be done under IAEA supervision, Salehi added.\\n\\nSince the deal's collapse, Iran has resumed enrichment at Fordo, near the Shiite holy city of Qom, some 90 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Tehran.\\n\\nShielded by the mountains, Fordo is ringed by anti-aircraft guns and other fortifications. It is about the size of a football field, large enough to house 3,000 centrifuges, but small and hardened enough to lead U.S. officials to suspect it had a military purpose when they exposed the site publicly in 2009.\\n\\nThe 2015 deal saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. The accord also called for Fordo to be turned into a research-and-development facility.\\n\\nUnder Iran's former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Tehran began 20% enrichment. Israel, which has its own undeclared nuclear weapons program, feared Tehran was building a bomb.\\n\\nAfter the discovery of Fordo, the U.S. worked on so-called bunker buster bombs designed to strike such facilities. As Israel threatened at one point to bomb Iranian nuclear sites like Fordo, U.S. officials reportedly showed them a video of a bunker-buster bomb destroying a mock-up of Fordo in America's southwestern desert.\\n\\nIsrael, which under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to criticize Iran's nuclear program, offered no immediate comment Saturday.\\n\\nAs of now, Iran is enriching uranium up to 4.5%, in violation of the accord's limit of 3.67%. Experts say Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium stockpiled for at least two nuclear weapons, if it chose to pursue them. Iran long has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful.\\n\\nIran separately has begun construction on a new site at Fordo, according to satellite photos obtained by The Associated Press in December.\\n\\nIran's announcement coincides with the anniversary of the U.S. drone striking Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad last year. That attack later saw Iran retaliate by launching a ballistic missile strike injuring dozens of U.S. troops in Iraq. Tehran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet that night, killing all 176 people on board.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAs the anniversary approached, the U.S. has sent B-52 bombers flying over the region and sent a nuclear-powered submarine into the Persian Gulf.\\n\\nOn Thursday, sailors discovered a limpet mine on a tanker in the Persian Gulf off Iraq near the Iranian border as it prepared to transfer fuel to another tanker owned by a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange. No one has claimed responsibility for the mining, though it comes after a series of similar attacks in 2019 that the U.S. Navy blamed on Iran. Tehran denied being involved.\\n\\nIn November, an Iranian scientist who founded the country's military nuclear program two decades earlier was killed in an attack Tehran blames on Israel."}

{"original": "The Big Idea is a series of Q&As with top lawmakers and figures.\\n\\nThe Trump administration announced new sanctions this week against companies related to Iran's metals industry as the Islamic nation said they are looking to enrich uranium to 20%. With President-elect Joe Biden taking office, former Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon hopes that the new administration will keep sanctions in place until Iran ceases its progress and renounces plans of acquiring nuclear weapons.\\n\\nBiden has said that he would like to form a new agreement with Iran to deal with their nuclear aspirations. A previous agreement was reached in 2015 when Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the multi-nation agreement, which Israel opposed before the U.S. ever joined it.\\n\\nREP. FLEISCHMANN'S BIG IDEA: HOW THE US CAN STAY AHEAD OF CHINA ON NUCLEAR ENERGY\\n\\nSince then, the Trump administration has brokered peace agreements between Israel and several Arab nations, all of whom recognize Iran as a threat in the region.\\n\\nDanon, who is now chair of World Likud -- an organization that represents the positions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party -- discussed these issues in an interview with Fox News, which can be found below. It has been lightly edited for clarity.\\n\\nQ: With a new U.S. president taking office in less than two weeks, how would you like to see the Biden administration handle the Iran nuclear situation?\\n\\nDanon: First I hope that the new administration will speak to allies in the region -- Israel and Arab countries -- before they take any steps regarding Iran. I think that would be the wise thing to do. And we hope that they will not try to appease the Iranians because we know that they're lying all the way around.\\n\\nIt's very rare that you have the Israelis and many countries in the region thinking the same way. I think that the U.S. should listen to their allies, respect their opinions, and regarding the regime you saw that – in 2014 even when they signed the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) they were lying all the way around.\\n\\nRON WYDEN'S BIG IDEA: DEFEND SECTION 230 AND PREVENT A 'GOVERNMENT SPEECH POLICE'\\n\\nQ: I understand that you'd like to see them continue sanctions moving forward. What would you want to see before any sanctions are lifted?\\n\\nDanon: We know that sanctions are very effective. We have nothing against the Iranian people, but the regime has threatened to do something against the U.S., against Israel. We hope the U.S. will continue to lead and get more European countries that will join. Then we can actually talk about changing the agreement. That's the only way to do it. Some of the European countries that have signatures on the JCPOA they acknowledge that the Iranians are breaching the agreement and seeing if it's feasible for them to support more sanctions and a tougher approach regarding Iran.\\n\\nQ: Joe Biden has indicated that he wants to reenter an agreement with Iran. Should that happen, what specific requirements would you want to see included?\\n\\nDanon: We have the idea of reentering the agreement and then negotiating with the Iranians. This is a mistake. That's not how you handle business. You don't enter the agreement and then negotiate. You do it in advance before you enter the agreement and I hope that will be the approach. And once there will be negotiations then I think we should be discussing a number of issues that are problematic. First is the issue of enriching uranium, which we just got a public announcement by Tehran that they are enriching to a level of 20% and from 20% it's really easy to jump to higher levels that will lead you to a nuclear bomb.\\n\\nKEVIN MCCARTHY'S 'BIG IDEA': 2020 ELECTION RESULTS A 'MANDATE AGAINST SOCIALISM'\\n\\nThe second issue is the ballistic missile tests that they have been conducting for the last few years. The third issue is funding terrorism. They are paying their proxies billions of dollars every year to promote terrorism all over the world. I think those should be the main issues we address if there will be any kind of negotiations.\\n\\nQ: The Trump administration has recently brokered landmark agreements between Israel and several Arab nations in recent months. In reaching these agreements, how important was it that the U.S. shared Israeli and Arab concerns about Iran?\\n\\nDanon: I think it was crucial. You can say a lot of things about the agreement with Iran, but one good that happened is it brought us together. Today we have very close relationships. I served in the U.N. for five years, we did it quietly but now we are doing it publicly. And I think you'll hear the same voices now publicly coming [from] Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv, and many other countries in the Middle East.\\n\\nQ: What do you think could happen if Joe Biden enters into an agreement with the same terms as the old one that President Obama entered, without consulting with Israel or Arabs?\\n\\nDanon: So I hope and I believe that will not happen. I also, when you follow the messages coming from the language of the president-elect, the language is a little bit different than it was from then. They're not saying they will rejoin the agreement immediately. I think we will hear a different language and we welcome it.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBut before it will happen, Israel will do whatever is necessary to defend ourselves. and for us allowing Iran to become nuclear is not an option. We said it in the past, we say it out loud today, and we will continue to say it in the future."}
{"original": "It's been a couple of days since now-Senator Mitt Romney's petty and divisive Washington Post op-ed smearing President Trump. The failed 2012 presidential candidate also made his feelings known about him in March of 2016 when he gave a speech condemning, again, the character of then-candidate Trump.\\n\\nIn that earlier screed, he also predicted that Trump's economic ideas would be a disaster for the country, and would lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America. That prediction, like all the rest of his enraged pearl-clutching that night, didn't age well.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of that 2016 attempted knee-capping of candidate Trump, I was especially struck by Romney's ostentatious moral preening. This week he returned, standing upon his same well-tended molehill of superiority to again point at and accuse the president of, sigh, being a bad, bad man.\\n\\nTAMMY BRUCE: MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY AND ROLE MODEL, RISES ABOVE DEMOCRATIC PETTINESS\\n\\nBut Romney's effort casting himself as the arbiter of character rings hollow for some who worked on, or were involved with, the Romney 2012 campaign for the presidency.\\n\\nOver the years, our current Ambassador to Germany and former Fox News contributor, Richard Grenell, and I became friends. Everyone was very excited when Romney, having won the GOP nomination in 2012, chose Ric to be his national security spokesman for the campaign. As the New York Times put it at the time, Mr. Grenell, a 45-year-old with a sharp wit, had joined the Romney campaign in April with sterling recommendations from Bush-era foreign policy figures, and an impressive résumé. He had served as a United States spokesman at the United Nations under four ambassadors during the Bush administration…\\n\\nChoosing Ric as his campaign national security spokesman was a natural and inspired choice. But when character mattered, Romney choked.\\n\\nWhile the following details have been presumed by many and written about by some, they have never been confirmed by Ric, who has a policy to never speak publicly about those for whom he has worked. Over the years, however, he has spoken to me about the details of his time on the campaign. But now, as Romney struts in with his smug rehab as the nation's moral arbiter, a more complete picture of the politician is warranted.\\n\\nAfter just three weeks with the Romney campaign, Ric resigned. There has been speculation about what exactly led to his departure. The fact of the matter is he was pushed out after Mr. Romney failed both a character and moral test: to stand up for someone he hired who was being attacked for being gay.\\n\\nBut it wasn't just refusing to stand up for someone he knew was the best person for the job. The Romney campaign responded to the criticism by asking Ric to stay quiet and not speak publicly about anything. The character-filled Romney was asking the gay man to go hide in the closet.\\n\\nThe last straw was when the Romney campaign told Ric to pretend he wasn't present during a conference call he arranged. In the aftermath, the New York Times reported of the bizarre scene, It was the biggest moment yet for Mitt Romney's foreign policy team: a conference call last Thursday, dialed into by dozens of news outlets from around the globe, to dissect and denounce President Obama's record on national security, reported the newspaper in May 2012, But Richard Grenell, the political strategist who helped organize the call and was specifically hired to oversee such communications, was conspicuously absent, or so everyone thought…\\n\\nRic, in fact, was present and listened as reporters asked if he would be joining the call and wondering why he wasn't there. The message was clear. He was facing a deliberately untenable situation, which would appall any serious person. He consulted with mentors and then resigned from the campaign.\\n\\nHe also made the decision to never say a bad word publicly about Mr. Romney. Ric even wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal endorsing Romney over Barack Obama, because it was the right thing to do.\\n\\nDid Romney recognize Ric's display of character over the years in how he handled that debacle? Likely not.\\n\\nDue to Romney's failure to defeat Mr. Obama, Ric had to wait four more years before the nation had a candidate and then president with the character to not just recognize Ric's talent but stand by him. Ric is now our Ambassador to Germany because President Trump made sure a passive-aggressive senate confirmed his nomination.\\n\\nMr. Romney says he doesn't like what Mr. Trump stands for. But perhaps the fact that Mr. Trump actually stands for something is what really outrages the also-ran.\\n\\nIn 2012, Mr. Romney's communications strategist was asked how the candidate's message would change now that they were headed into the general election. The answer revealed just how vapid, or dare I say, devoid of character, Romney really was.\\n\\nFrom the March, 21, 2012 edition of the New York Times, Mr. Fehrnstrom on Wednesday reached for a word to describe how Mr. Romney might pivot to the general election, the one that came tumbling from his mouth was 'Etch A Sketch,' the children's drawing toy in which nothing is ever permanent, reported the newspaper. 'Everything changes,' Mr. Fehrnstrom, 50, said on CNN, with a slight smirk that suggested he believed he was about to use a clever line. 'It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.'\\n\\nPresident Trump's personal mistakes have been the subject of non-stop public investigation, commentary and debate every single day, every hour, every minute, for years. We know the man, we know what he's done, and most of all, we know who he has become.\\n\\nDonald Trump, and his entire family, left comfortable lives, where their days were not filled with death threats, invective, lies, anthrax hoax letters, harassment on airplanes, in restaurants, mocking by the liberal media, accusations of being traitors, Nazis, and targeted by a weaponized federal government with the intention of nullifying his electoral success.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nYes, he became president, and family members have joined him, in working to deliver promises made on a campaign trail to bring back jobs, the economy, border security, the rule of law, and national security to this nation. In other words, he promised to bring back the future for American families.\\n\\nPresident Trump's promises and conversations with the American people during the campaign and every day since aren't written on an Etch A Sketch, and every day he pays the price for not being like Mitt Romney.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TAMMY BRUCE"}

Millions were captivated by her surprising 2018 primary victory over long-time liberal House member Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., and her achievement of becoming, at age 29, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.\\n\\nBut make no mistake about it: Despite receiving widespread positive attention from many in the press, Ocasio-Cortez's radical left-wing policy proposals and her socialist ideology present a significant threat to America's economy and its longstanding commitment to individual liberty. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't simply want to tweak our existing system, she wants to complete Barack Obama's goal of fundamentally transforming the United States of America.\\n\\nAt the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collective—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA doesn't merely want to create new government-run social programs, it desires, in the words of a member of DSA and the editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin, to in the long run … end capitalism. On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.\\n\\nDSA remains a fringe political organization in most of the country, but it was an integral part of helping its most famous member, Ocasio-Cortez, get elected in New York.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez's commitment to enacting democratic socialism is evident in many of her policy proposals, especially her plan for a Green New Deal. According to a draft resolution produced by Ocasio-Cortez to create a House climate change committee, the Green New Deal would eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in the United States by 2030 and instead force consumers to buy 100 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cost as much as five times more than existing fossil-fuel-power generation, and to purchase electric cars.\\n\\nEven more disturbing, Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal includes upgrading every residential and industrial building for state-of-the-art energy efficiency, comfort and safety, a plan that would cost trillions of dollars and give government access to every household in America.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States.

On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez's commitment to socialism isn't limited to energy and environment-related issues, either. She has also called for the passage of Medicare for All, legislation proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industry—at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez backs creating a radical government-funded program that would make public colleges tuition-free and cancel the $1.5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt, and she pledged during her campaign to support strict gun-control measures and plans to make housing a human right.\\n\\nHow does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez wants to impose her radical, socialist vision on every single American citizen, a fact most of those in the mainstream media who have spent the past several months fawning over her refuse to tell the public. We must stand against these assaults on capitalism and our personal freedoms, or else the next generation of Americans won't have access to the same liberties millions of our forefathers sacrificed for. For those of us who support free markets and personal liberty, losing this ideological battle is not an option."}

{"original": "I usually strongly disagree with Never-Trump leader Bill Kristol's constant criticism of President Trump. Kristol refuses to recognize the president's major accomplishments in improving the U.S. economy and making our country safer. He can't bring himself to admit that whatever flaws he thinks Mr. Trump may have, our country dodged a bullet with Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton since a Clinton presidency would have continued the disastrous domestic and foreign policies of President Obama. A President Hillary Clinton also would have undermined our freedom by naming at least two far-left Supreme Court justices.\\n\\nHaving said that, I respect Kristol for being a man of principle. I know where he stands. He has opposed Mr. Trump since the 2016 presidential campaign. Kristol hasn't changed his views for political expedience, to gain access to the president or to get a job with the Trump administration. The Weekly Standard – the conservative magazine founded by Kristol and Fred Barnes – recently went out of business in large part because Kristol refused to drop the magazine's anti-Trump corporate line. Sometimes sticking by your principles has a high price.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the new U.S. Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, who did his latest flipflop attacking President Trump in a January 1 Washington Post op-ed titled Mitt Romney: The president shapes the public character of the nation. Trump's character falls short.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FRED FLEITZ IN FOX NEWS OPINION.\\n\\nRomney excoriated the president in his op-ed by challenging his leadership and claiming he hasn't risen to the mantle of the presidency. Romney lamented the president's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and claimed his policies have divided the American people, caused dismay abroad and undermined democracy around the world.\\n\\nThese words echoed Romney's criticism of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign when he repeatedly attacked his character, calling him a fraud, a phony and a con man and vile. Romney also attacked Mr. Trump's foreign policy proposals as dangerous and not smart.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBut Romney was singing a different tune in 2012 during his presidential bid. After Donald Trump endorsed him in February 2012, saying Mitt is tough, he's sharp, he's smart, Romney replied in a speech at the Trump Hotel Las Vegas when he said: Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and getting his endorsement is a delight. I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement, and of course, I'm looking for the endorsement of the people of Nevada.\\n\\nRomney flipflopped again after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, doing what the Washington Post called a stunning 180 on Donald Trump and sucked up to Mr. Trump to be his Secretary of State. And then in early 2018, when Romney faced a serious primary challenge to be the Republican candidate to succeed retiring Utah Senator Orin Hatch, Romney gratefully accepted President Trump's endorsement which Mr. Trump expressed in this tweet:\\n\\nRomney replied:\\n\\nDuring Romney's Senate campaign he dropped his harsh criticism of President Trump and denied that he had been a leader of the Never Trump movement. Romney indicated in an October 2018 speech that although he has had some differences with the president, he was generally supportive of him and thought Mr. Trump had been pretty effective.\\n\\nPresident Trump was not the person I wanted to become the nominee of our party, but he's president now. The policies he's promoted have been pretty effective. And I support a lot of those policies. When there's a place where I disagree, I point that out.\\n\\nSo now, after speaking well of President Trump during his Senate campaign, Mitt Romney has turned on him again. One has to wonder that if Romney held such major objections to the president, why did he hide them from the people of Utah before the midterm election? The answer is obvious: revealing his true feelings about Mr. Trump could have cost Romney the election.\\n\\nSome have speculated that Mitt Romney wrote his recent op-ed slamming President Trump's character because he plans to run against him in 2020. Others have said Romney is trying to draw attention to himself and become a go-to congressman for media comments about President Trump.\\n\\nI don't know what Romney's reasons are for his new attack on President Trump. I do know that in light of Romney's flipflops on Trump, he cannot portray his op-ed as principled opposition to Mr. Trump.\\n\\nMr. Romney, you're no Bill Kristol."}

Democrats who controlled the redistricting process overhauled the district in 2011, turning what had been a reliably Republican stronghold into a Democratic district.\\n\\nSeveral Republican voters sued over the new district's boundaries, claiming it unfairly favored Democrats.\\n\\nA day after the November elections, a three-judge panel agreed with the Republicans who sued and ordered Maryland officials to draw a new congressional redistricting plan that isn't tainted by partisan gerrymandering.\\n\\nJudge Paul Niemeyer of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said in his opinion for the panel that the Maryland congressional map removed roughly 66,000 Republican voters from the district and added around 24,000 Democratic voters, bringing about the single greatest alteration of voter makeup in any district in the Nation following the 2010 census.\\n\\nTrone is not a party to the case, but he filed a legal brief in which he said he is no fan of partisan gerrymandering, but that does not mean it is a terminal disease, much less one that the judiciary can or should cure."}
{"original": "The hospitality industry will continue to face an unprecedented level of challenges amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2021, and success will rely on how companies and individual properties respond to the key trends that are poised to shape the year ahead.\\n\\nWith some valuable insight from data and analytics company GlobalData, here are some of the notable hospitality trends to watch for in 2021.\\n\\nEnhanced Hygiene Protocols\\n\\nThe hospitality industry was quick to implement elevated safety and hygiene procedures in the weeks and months after the COVID-19 pandemic was first declared in March 2020, but companies are likely to continue building on and improving their various healthy stay programs and partnerships in the new year as they look to not only assure guests but separate themselves from the competition.\\n\\nExtended Stays\\n\\nHotels and resorts introduced extended stay programs and packages en masse last year and that trend will continue in 2021 as guests pursue longer stays. Travelers will be looking to take fewer trips — if not forced to due to ongoing travel restrictions — but those that do travel are expected to also stay for longer to grab what they can when they can, says GlobalData Travel & Tourism Analyst Ralph Hollister. Uncertainty is strife and it may lead to people going 'all out' on one big trip, rather than risking several smaller ones that could be canceled.\\n\\nWork-Friendly Rooms\\n\\nWith many travelers opting for longer stays, their trip might not be limited to leisure, and thus they'll be looking for a room they can work from comfortably while enjoying more privacy compared to the on-site business center. Fast Wi-Fi and practical workstations could be the deciding factor for many travelers looking to blend work and play in 2021.\\n\\nTouchless Technology\\n\\nMinimizing touchpoints will continue to be a primary goal across the travel sector in the new year as hotels as well as airports, restaurants and other places have turned to mobile apps and QR codes to reduce the spread of potentially harmful germs. In 2021, hotels will increase their adoption of technology that reduces the number of touchpoints. Abilities such as online check-ins and check-outs, mobile keys and room settings controlled by Internet of Things (IoT) technology will become much more commonplace, added Hollister. Using IoT to control room settings also allows hotels to gather more data on guests, creating a more personalized experience when they next return.\\n\\nAdded Flexibility\\n\\nSuccessful properties will be ones that are able to offer guests added flexibility by way of 100% refunds for last-minute cancellations, along with other risk-reducing policies. Having a flexible cancelation policy on a hotel website will be vital in ensuring direct bookings, and these relaxed policies will continue in 2021. For example, Marriott International has just extended its 24-hour global cancelation policy through March 31, 2021. This extension into next year will be emulated by its rivals in order to remain competitive, Hollister predicts.\\n\\nIncreased Privacy\\n\\nIn addition to flexibility, travelers will be seeking increased privacy in 2021. Short-term home rentals through Airbnb and Vrbo as well as family- and group-friendly villa stays from Villas of Distinction and others that offer guests more space and privacy than a traditional hotel room will continue to be in high demand. Properties in secluded domestic destinations where travelers can worry less about local restrictions and close encounters with strangers will also continue to be popular.\\n\\nOutdoor Spaces\\n\\nIn 2021, travelers will feel safer spending time outdoors compared to enclosed spaces when it comes to being in public. Whether it's meeting and event space, outdoor dining, or inviting green spaces for socially distant coffee breaks or yoga sessions, more and more properties will be looking to incorporate the outdoors into the guest experience.\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\nHotels and resorts have been going green for some time now, and that trend is unlikely to go away in 2021 as more travelers look to limit their impact on the environment and experience the local culture. Reducing waste and water usage as well as sourcing locally produced products in on-site bars and restaurants will remain a key for properties looking to differentiate themselves moving forward.\\n\\nContactless Food and Beverage\\n\\nReducing contact through touchless technology means offering food and beverage in ways that limit human interactions, whether it's via grab-and-go options in the lobby, room service leaving meals at the guestroom door, or the aforementioned QR codes and scannable menus that allow guests to browse and order from the safety of their smartphone.\\n\\nValue Travelers\\n\\nMany will be facing limited travel budgets in 2021, so properties will need to appeal to value travelers who will be in search of low rates but also willing to spend a little bit more if it means an improved quality of stay, safer experience and increased flexibility or benefits."}
{"original": "Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post that savaged Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response Wednesday morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see.\\n\\nBut for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's well-worth reading. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.\\n\\nRomney's main complaint in the piece is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true, of course. But beneath the personal slights, Romney has a policy critique of Trump. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL EPISODE OF TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those, too. His piece throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago.\\n\\nThat's not surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a remarkable number of the companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\\n\\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support those goals enthusiastically.\\n\\nThere are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is entire populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\\n\\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions.\\n\\nBut they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be gone, too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live? These are the only questions that matter.\\n\\nThe answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. And yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\\n\\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would want if they cared.\\n\\nBut our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\\n\\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell us that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, meanwhile, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this.\\n\\nMembers of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the Democratic Party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow, they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\\n\\n\\n\\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\\n\\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: Culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. How do we know? Consider the inner cities.\\n\\nThirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and many other places and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal.\\n\\nWhat caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't even want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner-city dysfunction and it made sense: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what conservatives called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\\n\\nThere was truth in this. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit.\\n\\nThis is striking because rural Americans wouldn't seem to have much in common with anyone from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly.\\n\\nYet, the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic. Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. But mostly they're not. They don't have to be interested. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind.\\n\\nBut Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men.\\n\\nNow, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.\\n\\nThis isn't speculation. This is not propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. But increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\\n\\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\\n\\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\\n\\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.\\n\\nSheryl Sandberg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandberg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandberg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich.\\n\\nWe are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows.\\n\\nWhat's remarkable is how the rest of us responded to it. We didn't question why Sandberg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandberg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It is not. It is bondage. Republicans should say so.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest.\\n\\nWe're OK with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work -- consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, as our leaders should, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere.\\n\\nAnd that's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us.\\n\\nMaybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about us.\\n\\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close.\\n\\nUnder our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate as someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of our rich people do.\\n\\nIn 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Mitt Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating.\\n\\nOur leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other.\\n\\nThat happens in countries, too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. And nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are getting special treatment. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old.\\n\\nA country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up in no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point.\\n\\nBut first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\\n\\n\\n\\nInternalizing all this will not be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. They'll be criticized. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism.\\n\\nThat's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and very soon unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first.\\n\\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from Tucker Carlson Tonight on January 2, 2019."}

{"original": "Most Democrats identify as liberals for the first time, according to an analysis released Tuesday -- marking the latest sign of a leftward shift of the Democratic Party as it lurches to the fringes on issues such as Medicare-for-all, amnesty for illegal immigrants and a Green New Deal.\\n\\nAccording to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.\\n\\nThe study is the latest evidence of a party that is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate -- particularly on health care, economics and immigration.\\n\\nSOCIALISM RISING: DEMS TAKE HOUSE PUSHING MASSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPANSION, AS PARTY LURCHES LEFT\\n\\nOn Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to launch the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation to guarantee health care for all in the city -- including illegal immigrants.\\n\\nWhile the federal government works to gut health care for millions of Americans, New York City is leading the way by guaranteeing that every New Yorker has access to quality, comprehensive access to care, regardless of immigration status or their ability to pay, he said in a statement.\\n\\nDe Blasio's announcement came after California's new Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined a similarly ambitious health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting ObamaCare. Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, up from 19, according to Newsom's new agenda.\\n\\nThose left-wing voices presenting once-fringe ideas are also growing louder in Washington, particularly among the new intake of members in the House who have been bolder in embracing left-wing policy proposals and terms like Democratic Socialism.\\n\\nA New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls.\\n\\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the new members in the House and a rising Democratic star, has pushed universal health care as well as a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive Green New Deal that she said would be a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.\\n\\nA draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.\\n\\nIf that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. Its proposals on the economic front include a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.\\n\\nSo far a number of House members, as well as top 2020 prospects, have offered their support to the proposal.\\n\\nIt is therefore no surprise that Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the term Democratic socialism.

{"original": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday night that President Trump used his prime-time Oval Office address to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his Administration.\\n\\nThe President of the United States – having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill – has shut down the government, Schumer said in a response delivered jointly with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

We don't govern by temper tantrum.\\n\\nSchumer called on Trump to approve legislation ending the partial government shutdown while allowing debate over border security to continue.\\n\\nTRUMP LAMENTS 'CRISIS OF THE HEART AND A CRISIS OF THE SOUL' AT BORDER\\n\\nWe can re-open the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy, Schumer said. We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And, we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security.

Well, he's right. But it's an emergency and a crisis that he himself has created.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nSanders also accused Trump of trying to create fear and hatred in our country ... and, in the process, divert our attention away from the real crises facing the working families of this nation, specifically citing income inequality, climate change, health care, and student debt.\\n\\nMr. President, we don't need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones, Sanders said. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people."}

{"original": "The two U.S. Senate runoff elections that will be held in Georgia Tuesday will determine whether the Senate will work in partnership with President-elect Joe Biden to build a better future for Americans, or whether Republican obstructionists who put politics ahead of patriotism will be empowered to do everything possible to oppose our new president.\\n\\nGeorgia is a formerly red state that turned semi-blue in November, when a majority of voters wisely cast their ballots for former Vice President Biden.\\n\\nAnd yes, despite President Trump's baseless claims that he actually won in the state, recounts have proven beyond any doubt that Biden carried Georgia. Trump now makes the ridiculous and delusional claim that the state's Republican governor and secretary of state are part an imaginary plot that deprived him of a victory.\\n\\nRICHARD FOWLER: IN GEORGIA SENATE RACES, KEY VOTING BLOC GIVES DEMOCRATS EXCELLENT CHANCE OF WINNING\\n\\nIt's in the national interest for Georgia voters to follow up on their support for President-elect Biden by voting Tuesday to elect Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock to the Senate. Both men are highly qualified. Their election will give Biden the Democratic majority he needs in the Senate to repair the enormous damage Trump has caused to our nation in the past four years.\\n\\nThe incoming administration of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris needs a Senate willing to work with them to fully and effectively respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, systemic racism in our nation's law enforcement, the existential threat of climate change, and other important challenges our nation faces.\\n\\nUnfortunately and disgracefully, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made it clear that he will block, stonewall and try to derail every action by the Biden administration.\\n\\nRecall that McConnell famously stated in 2010: The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\\n\\nSo McConnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the American people. Not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. No, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt President Obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the American people. You can bet every penny you have that McConell feels the same way about our incoming president.\\n\\nThe best way to stop McConnell is to elect Ossoff and Warnock to give Democrats 50 Senate seats — creating a tie with the 50 Republican senators. Vice President Harris will cast the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats majority control of the Senate.\\n\\nTaking a page from Trump's angry and divisive playbook filled with a mountain of lies, Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler (running against Warnock) and David Perdue (running against Ossoff) have gone on the attack and have falsely and ridiculously labeled their respective Democratic challengers as radical socialists.\\n\\nNothing could be further from the truth.\\n\\nTrump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in Georgia or across the United States in the November election, and I don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in Georgia.\\n\\nThe truth is that Warnock and Ossoff are mainstream candidates dedicated to public service, and they echo President-elect Biden's hopeful unifying message. They are laser-focused on the facts, the issues, and the values that matter to suffering Georgians in these perilous times.\\n\\nWarnock, the only Black candidate in the Tuesday runoff, is the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the former pulpit of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\\n\\nThe demonization of this pastor who now preaches in Dr. King's church is part of a long and disgraceful history in Georgia of hostility to its Black residents. In fact, Georgia has never elected a single Black U.S. senator, governor, lieutenant governor, or secretary of state. And yet the Census Bureau estimates that 32% of the state's population is Black.\\n\\nWarnock rose in Georgia politics through his vocal leadership of the campaign to expand Medicaid for low-income residents of the state. He supports increased COVID-19 relief funding, expanding the Affordable Care Act (the ACA, also known as ObamaCare), and passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\\n\\nWarnock has been endorsed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter (a fellow Georgian) and Obama, and by former U.N. Ambassador and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. Warnock is also backed by former Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia and Georgia House of Representatives Minority Leader Stacey Abrams of Fair Fight, a national voting rights organization rooted in Georgia.\\n\\nOssoff is a Georgia native, media executive, investigative journalist, and small-business owner. He also previously worked as a national security aide for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., handling defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and economic policy issues.\\n\\nLike Warnock, Ossoff supports strengthening the ACA, increased COVID-19 relief, criminal justice reform, and lower taxes for working families and small businesses in Georgia.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nLoeffler and Perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge President-elect Biden's victory. They agree with anything Trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. They act as if they are running to be selected by Trump to be his employees on The Apprentice, rather than to represent the people of Georgia in the Senate.\\n\\nLoeffler and Perdue were both against additional $2,000 COVID-19 economic stimulus checks before they were for the checks (but only after Trump's belated tweet storm). They have both questioned the integrity of the November election and even demanded the resignation of a fellow Republican, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\\n\\nTruth be told, Loeffler and Perdue — not Warnock and Ossoff — are the radical candidates running in Georgia. The Republican candidates are out-of-touch with Georgia voters and values and reject their Senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Their only loyalty is to Donald Trump and to their own self-interest.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nI implore Georgians to turn history on its head and to get out the vote for Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff on Tuesday.

While there are no new announcements at this time, common-sense and national security both dictate that if a country wants to fully participate in U.S. immigration programs, they should also comply with all security and counter-terrorism measures -- because we do not want to import terrorism or any other national security threat into the United States.\\n\\nNevertheless, Omar and Tlaib both addressed the travel ban Friday.\\n\\nWhat do 5 out of 7 of these countries have in common?

Massive protests added to the disorder.\\n\\nTrump's first version of the travel ban -- dubbed by critics as the Muslim ban because it called for a 90-day travel from Muslim-majority countries Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, proposed blocking refugee admissions for 120 days and suspended travel from Syria -- was immediately blocked by the courts.\\n\\nA watered-down version was eventually upheld by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote.\\n\\nThe list of banned countries could potentially be doubled from seven to 14, two people familiar with the proposal told the Associated Press.

{"original": "China is betraying a level of strategic anxiety not yet seen as the impact of trade tariffs looms and its return to its historical power role in the Asia seems to have stalled.\\n\\nOn Dec. 20, Chinese Rear Adm. Lou Yuan, while speaking at a military trade conference, announced that what the United States feared most was casualties and that the easiest way to defeat China's main rival was to sink two American supercarriers, killing over 10,000 sailors in the process. When that has happened, Admiral Lou announced, then we'll see how frightened America is.\\n\\nLou's statements were followed just a few days later by China's president, Xi Jinping, who threateningly said China reserves the option of taking all necessary measures to ensure peaceful reunification with Taiwan, a democracy that has governed itself apart from China since 1949. Xi added that Beijing was willing to fight the bloody battle against our enemies, and menacingly predicted: Reunification is the historical trend and the right path, Taiwan independence is ... a dead end.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ 'STATE DEPARTMENT ISSUES NEW CHINA TRAVEL WARNING'\\n\\nThis is a stark escalation of language. Taken with other examples of bellicose rhetoric that have increasingly issued from Beijing officials, it is clear that Xi Jinping and his supporters have been badly rattled by the recent events.\\n\\nChina's leaders assumed after the 2008 global financial crisis that the Communist, centrally controlled economic state's time had come. It would regain its historic role in the region. It could cast off the cloak of a peaceful rise to assume a hegemonic role in the Asia-Pacific region.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBut Xi and his followers have watched their diplomatic, economic and military initiatives come up short, engendering increased resistance from other Indo-Pacific nations rather than the realignment China had expected. Now the Trump administration's trade tariffs threaten to destabilize the Chinese economy, resulting in a cascade failure of Xi Jinping's broader strategy and threatening to undermine the legitimacy of the Communist Party, hence the stronger and more strident attacks.\\n\\nChina's desperate attempts to regain the momentum, however, betray an ignorance of the American culture.\\n\\nChina perceived the lack of strategic focus of the George W. Bush administration and the passive lead from behind foreign policy of the Obama administration as American decay and decline. In reality, the foundational aspects of the American economy remain surprisingly strong and the American fighting spirit is not dead -- merely sleeping. Those who would believe that the sinking of two aircraft carriers would trigger an impulse toward retreat would do well to make themselves aware of the United States' history and the impact events such as the sinking of the Lusitania, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the collapse of the World Trade Center had on the national psyche. What some have labeled the Jacksonian impulse could be described as a tendency toward great power rage. To be sure, it burns itself out. After all, the U.S. is considering leaving Afghanistan, 17 years later.\\n\\nBut make no mistake: Any attack upon a single U.S. aircraft carrier by long-range aircraft, cruise missiles or ballistic missiles would surely generate a response against the bases from which those weapons were launched, the sensors associated with them and the command-and-control nodes that directed them, and then the United States would turn its attention on the Chinese naval and merchant fleet.\\n\\nBefore China knew what was happening, it would be cut off from the overseas sources of energy and raw materials that fuel its import/export economy. Within weeks it would be without fuel and its factories would be shuttered. The American economy, established in a nation that has most resources domestically available, would be able to ride out the storm, even if China attempted to climb the escalation ladder and attack targets in North America.\\n\\nFor China, it is better to get its more bellicose voices under control and approach the bargaining table with the United States over trade issues in good faith and with an openness to real compromise on the economic issues that divide our two nations, rather than resorting to nationalist saber rattling.\\n\\nXi Jinping should try harder to understand his real strategic position while remembering that he who rides the tiger finds it difficult to dismount. There will be no return to global hegemony or Middle Kingdom status. China brought its candle out from under the basket too soon, and its broader, aggressive ambitions have been revealed.\\n\\nAs for the United States, it should follow the lead of President Trump and his new acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who between them have identified that we are in an era of great power competition that will require more effort and that the focus of that competition is China, and China and China."}

I'll give you an update on exactly what she said and respond in just a moment.\\n\\nBut first, the City of San Francisco has just declared a state of emergency in response to coronavirus, and yet, you'll remember that for a month Western leaders told us that the virus was under control and was unlikely to cause serious problems for anyone in our hemisphere.\\n\\nNone of that was true, but saying it was less painful than rethinking the failed theology of globalism, so they went with it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in China, an aggressively nationalist country that if nothing else, definitely doesn't hate itself, authorities acted immediately and with force.\\n\\nWith military grade discipline, they shut down the City of Wuhan, home to 11 million people. The rest of the world watched this happen in real time, but yet assured themselves that everything was fine.\\n\\nIt wasn't fine. We know that now. At least 35 countries have confirmed cases of coronavirus as of tonight. Last Friday, Italy reported six, yet at midday today, they had 283 and then by tonight, that number had risen to 322. That is a steep trajectory.\\n\\nSo far 11 people have died in Italy and parts of the country are shutting down.\\n\\nIran has confirmed 15 deaths plus 95 cases, although the real number is believed to be higher than that. One of those infected is the country's own Deputy Health Minister, who was seen sweating profusely on Monday at a press conference downplaying the outbreak.\\n\\nHe later appeared on an Iranian news program to reassure the country that everything was under control, and then he coughed on the woman interviewing him.\\n\\nIn this country, there are more than 50 confirmed cases. Today, the Centers for Disease Control confirmed that a generalized outbreak is inevitable here, It's not a question of if this will happen, but when. Officials warned Americans to be ready for severe disruptions to their lives.\\n\\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\\n\\nNANCY MESSONNIER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES, C.D.C.: ... include dividing students into smaller groups or in a severe pandemic, closing schools and using internet based tele-schooling to continue education.\\n\\nFor adults, businesses can replace in-person meetings with video or telephone conferences and increase teleworking options.\\n\\nOn a larger scale, communities and cities may need to modify, postpone or cancel mass gatherings.\\n\\nDisruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now.\\n\\nPeople are concerned about the situation. I would say rightfully so. I'm concerned about the situation. C.D.C. is concerned about the situation.\\n\\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: So what exactly will a coronavirus pandemic mean for this country? Well, of course, you can't really say, it's impossible to predict with precision.\\n\\nBut here's one forecast that caught our eyes from The Atlantic. It is titled, You're Likely to Get the Coronavirus. That piece quotes extensively a Harvard epidemiologist. The article describes him as a cautious professional, the kind of person who carefully considers every word and then backs it with data.\\n\\nWhat the professor told the magazine is this, I think the likely outcome is the coronavirus will ultimately not be containable. He went on to predict that in the next year 40 to 70 percent of the people on Earth will be infected with coronavirus.\\n\\nNo, not all of them will become ill. Many he says will be asymptomatic or feel no worse than they do with a cold. But nevertheless, 70 percent of the world's population -- that is a big number. In fact, it's 5.4 billion people.\\n\\nCurrently, the coronavirus appears to kill about two percent of the people who have it. So let's be generous for a moment and imagine that asymptomatic carriers are not detected and the real death rate is only say half a percent that would be one quarter of the current estimates.\\n\\nEven under that scenario, there would still be 27 million deaths from coronavirus globally. In this country, more than a million would die.\\n\\nAnd according to The Atlantic, many experts fear this may not be a one-off epidemic. Cold and flu season could become cold, flu and coronavirus season for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWill that happen? Well, obviously we're praying that it doesn't. But we know one thing. Right now, as of tonight, America is not ready for this or for any major epidemic. Thanks to the C.D.C.'s flood rollout of coronavirus testing, few locations in this country are even prepared to monitor coronavirus and the economy of course isn't prepared either.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones just fell close to 900 points today. That's on top of yesterday's thousand point drop. Overall, U.S. markets are down eight to nine percent compared to earlier this month. If that continues, it's not good.\\n\\nAs of tonight, a total of 14 Americans infected with coronavirus are under strict quarantine at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.

How does this contagion look?\\n\\nSCHWEDHELM: Ebola was highly infectious, but not as contagious. And this virus that we're talking about the COVID-19 is more like influenza in how it spread through respiratory droplets.\\n\\nSo I think that that's, you know, the potential to be a lot more contagious.\\n\\nSIEGEL: Do you feel that here in the U.S., we're better off prepared.\\n\\nSCHWEDHELM: I think the U.S. has done a nice job in working through preparedness in the last year, but long ways to go. There's -- I'll go ahead.\\n\\nSIEGEL: She has to go now to the transport to bring the other patient in, Tucker. In the meantime, we're going to have more from the Medical Center tomorrow, but we also went to Dulles Airport last night and we looked at how the virus is slipping in to the United States. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nSIEGEL: This is the main terminal at Dulles International Airport where 65,000 passengers come at every day from 125 locations.\\n\\nKEN CUCCINELLI, ACTING DEPUTY SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECRETARY: Our borders are no guarantee that the virus won't find its way here.\\n\\nSIEGEL: We met up with Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, Ken Cuccinelli at Customs. He's a key member of the President's Coronavirus Task Force.\\n\\nCUCCINELLI: The President has made it very clear to us, whatever we need to do to stay ahead of this and keep America safe, he has told us to do.\\n\\nSIEGEL: Despite several hundred cases of coronavirus, flights continue to come in from Tokyo. In fact, one is currently in Customs.\\n\\nCUCCINELLI: We have some lines of folks who've come in internationally. This is all international here. Customs and Border Protection, they are looking at your travel history. They're asking you different questions than maybe they did a month or two ago.\\n\\nAnd we're looking backwards through travel records that we have in addition to your passport to identify whether or not you've been to a risky area. Wuhan, China, Hubei Province in China. Really, we look at now all of Mainland China that way.\\n\\nSIEGEL (voice over): Travelers who were recently in Wuhan face a mandatory two-week quarantine. A passenger who shows signs of illness gets health screenings administered by the C.D.C. But even with those measures, there are too many moving parts and the virus is too elusive to be stopped entirely.\\n\\nCUCCINELLI: Really what we're trying to do is slow down the virus getting here and reduce the impact when it does get here.\\n\\nSIEGEL (on camera): We still have very few coronavirus test kits around. So we don't know how much of the virus there is. We also still don't know exactly how contagious it is. And we don't know how deadly it is.\\n\\nBut one thing we do know, people are continuing to come to the United States, many of whom are traveling from countries where coronavirus is spreading.\\n\\nWith cases burgeoning in Japan and in South Korea, some in Iran, how are you going to change the process here?\\n\\nCUCCINELLI: Well, there's a difference of course with Japan and Korea and Iran. Iran is an enemy state and it's hard to interact there.\\n\\nKorea and Japan are friendly states and we have military forces in those countries. These are countries, they are first world countries. They have outstanding health care systems, and yet the speed of virus spread is very high.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nSIEGEL: Tucker, back to you in New York.\\n\\nCARLSON: Dr. Marc Siegel for us in Omaha tonight. Thanks so much for that.\\n\\nWell, at a time like this, it would be nice to have an effective World Health Organization, one led by serious capable professionals. That might be invaluable for beating coronavirus or at least containing it. But we don't have that.\\n\\nInstead, the WHO is a corrupt mess from top to bottom. The current Director General of the World Health Organization is a man called Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He was previously the Health Minister of Ethiopia.\\n\\nNow politically, Tedros was a member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, that's a Marxist-Leninist Ethiopian political party. It is part of the coalition ruling Ethiopia as a repressive authoritarian state.\\n\\nAfter taking control of the World Health Organization, Tedros promptly tried to appoint Robert Mugabe, the murderous dictator of Zimbabwe as an international goodwill ambassador for public health, if you can believe that.\\n\\nTedros delivered a speech praising Zimbabwe as, A country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide healthcare to all. Now, that's lunatic. But bad politics aside, Tedros has endangered human lives, which is a weird resume point for a man running a World Health Organization.\\n\\nAs Health Minister in Ethiopia, on three separate occasions, Tedros covered up cholera outbreaks in the south of the country. To downplay the outbreaks and to protect the Ethiopian's reputation, Tedros each time insisted that they were simply rashes of acute watery diarrhea.\\n\\nAccording to media reports, Ethiopian officials pressured aid agencies to cover up the truth about what was happening and hide the number of people affected.\\n\\nAs soon as the disease spread to neighboring countries, it was obvious that it was cholera and identified as such. If Tedros had told the truth at the time which he did not, lives could have been saved.\\n\\nThis is the man running the World Health Organization at the beginnings of a global epidemic.\\n\\nWhen coronavirus first broke out in China, China refused to admit international health experts into their country to assess it. To this day, it seems likely that China is lying about the number of infections and the number of deaths. Yet despite this, Tedros has publicly praised the Communist Chinese party for transparency.\\n\\nThe whole thing is Orwellian. And by the way your tax dollars are paying for it. The U.S. gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the WHO. It amounts to a huge percentage of their budget. So how do they spend the money?\\n\\nWell, every year about $200 million of the World Health Organization budget goes to travel for its bureaucrats and staff. They often fly business class, sometimes using fraudulent pretext to do so when it's otherwise forbidden.\\n\\nOther aid agencies, respectable ones like Doctors Without Borders, or our own C.D.C. banned officials from doing that because it's wasteful.\\n\\nThis is the organization the world is looking to for guidance as it battles a pandemic that could kill millions of people.\\n\\nJeff Stier is a Senior Fellow at the Taxpayer Protection Alliance. He's covered corruption at the WHO for years. He joins us tonight. Jeff, thanks so much for coming on.\\n\\nJEFF STIER, SENIOR FELLOW, CONSUMER CHOICE CENTER: Good to be here.\\n\\nCARLSON: So how did this man who seems not just unqualified but seems to have the kind of background that would make him exactly the wrong person to run the World Health Organization? How did he get this job?\\n\\nSTIER: Well, that's right, even though U.S. taxpayers cover about almost half the bill for the WHO, a $2 billion a year WHO budget, we have very little say over what they do, and they have elections. Different countries have voted to support Mugabe. There's been a corruption at the WHO before Mugabe.\\n\\nBut people like myself who were sounding the alarm bells to have a Marxist -- this guy was the number three official in a Marxist regime of Ethiopia.\\n\\nAnd as you pointed out, he went on to appoint Robert Mugabe of all people to be a goodwill ambassador. This says a culture of corruption at the WHO that goes beyond Tedros. It goes beyond the prior Director General. It's part of the culture.\\n\\nThis was not -- you pointed out the $200 million a year they spend on first class air travel and hotels, that's more than they spend on AIDS, tuberculosis, and other diseases combined, and there's no oversight.\\n\\nThere was a criticism of that five years ago. The Associated Press get a report just in 2017 and found that it was happening again, and Dr. Tedros, his primary goal, socialized healthcare all over the world. That's his goal.\\n\\nWe need to have faith in our public health institutions. But right now, the World Health Organization needs oversight. It has shown us time and again, it's not going to reform itself. And we, U.S. taxpayers who are funding this corruption need to do a better job of putting in some oversight.\\n\\nCARLSON: I mean, that's a shocking story, but it goes from annoying kind of head shaking to really a peril to our country in the middle of a rising epidemic.\\n\\nSo, a guy who denied the existence, who tried to cover up the existence of an epidemic is coordinating the world's response to this epidemic, a threatening one. Does this have implications?\\n\\nSTIER: It does. It does. Well, as he pointed out, he has been praising China -- Dr. Tedros has been praising China for transparency.\\n\\nThat's like Lance Armstrong crediting the Houston Astros for having good sportsmanship. It's totally absurd.\\n\\nNow, I have called for the U.S. to cut back funding for the WHO and the President has put that in his budget.\\n\\nAnd now people like the Mailman School of Public Health Professor, Chelsea Clinton are saying that this potential outbreak is Trump's fault, right?\\n\\nWe need oversight of the WHO. We need to reform it, but we need to do so, we need to give it money with strings attached because it is times like this that we need to have an institution that the public can trust and the WHO doesn't deserve it and they haven't earned it and we shouldn't be funding it at the same levels.\\n\\nCARLSON: So we're almost out of time, Jeff. But did you just say Chelsea Clinton is a public health professor?\\n\\nSTIER: At the Mailman School of Public Health there at Columbia University. She had a piece on cnn.com just yesterday, blaming this administration for not being prepared.\\n\\nThe problem is --\\n\\nCARLSON: I thought she worked at a hedge fund or was a documentary filmmaker. I didn't know she even had a job. How did she wind up as a public health -- I mean, how low are the standards?\\n\\nSTIER: Well, it is the Columbia School of Public Health here in Manhattan. So it's pretty troubling and, you know, she got her piece placed on cnn.com, so at least, she has an outlet.\\n\\nBut the WHO doesn't want to hear from its critics.\\n\\nCARLSON: No, obviously not. Our higher education in this country is a joke, and unfortunately, that can have really bad consequences. I hope we're not going to see them now.\\n\\nJeff, great to. Thank you.\\n\\nSTIER: Good to see you, Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, a California City is in uproar tonight over plans to transfer coronavirus patients there. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has the very latest on that story. Hey, Trace.\\n\\nTRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker, the Mayor of Costa Mesa says she was blindsided when the State of California informed her that dozens of coronavirus patients would soon be housed there.\\n\\nCosta Mesa is in Orange County and is home to about 100,000 people. It's also home to the Fairview Developmental Center, a state-owned facility, that one housed about 3,000 adults with developmental disabilities.\\n\\nToday, the center is almost empty and state authorities thought it would be the perfect place to send people who test positive for coronavirus. That is until the mayor, city council and local residents said uh-uh. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nKATRINA FOLEY, COSTA MESA MAYOR: I can't think of one situation that would lead us to believe that this is an appropriate location. Why? Why Costa Mesa? Why now?\\n\\nI think there must be politics at all levels involved in this because none of it makes sense.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nGALLAGHER: Politics in California, who would think? So the city filed a restraining order against everyone from the State of California to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to block the transfer of the patients.\\n\\nA Federal judge has now ordered city and state officials to convene on Friday to sort this whole thing out.\\n\\nThe State of California says the potential for transmission of the virus is negligible, but residents are vowing to fight on and the mayor wonders why the Fairview Center is suddenly appropriate to house coronavirus patients when just last week, the state said it was not adequate to house the homeless -- Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: Trace Gallagher. Amazing story. We will get more on the coronavirus later this hour and how the Trump administration is planning to respond.\\n\\nTomorrow, we're going to try and follow up with the idea that Chelsea Clinton is a Public Health Professor weighing in on the coronavirus. That ought to worry you.\\n\\nPlus, the South Carolina primary is just days away. One of the top two candidates can't remember what office he is running for and the other defends dictators. That's next.\\n\\nAnd then the judge in the Roger Stone case attacked the show today. We will respond to her claims, just ahead.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, assuming civilization endures until then, the South Carolina Democratic primary will be held this Saturday. Mark your calendars.\\n\\nFormer presidential favorite Joe Biden still hasn't won anything in the race so far, but he is counting on South Carolina to be his firewall.\\n\\nThat's a cliche the Democratic and Republican political animals use all the time, a firewall that will give him momentum going into Super Tuesday to make or break contest. At least that was the plan. At this point, it's not even clear Biden knows what office he is running for.\\n\\nOn Monday, he seemed to think he was running for something else.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Where I come from, you don't get far unless you ask. My name is Joe Biden, I am a Democratic candidate in the United States Senate. Look me over, if you like what you see, help out; if not, vote for the other guy. But give me a look though, okay.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Poor guy. We feel guilty even running that sound. But it gets even worse. Last week, Biden told you that he was arrested in South Africa for trying to see Nelson Mandela under apartheid.\\n\\nNow, he is saying he crafted a major treaty with a world leader who has been dead almost a quarter century.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBIDEN: One of things I proud of stuff is getting past, getting moved, getting control of the Paris Climate Accord. I'm the guy that came back after meeting with Deng Xiaoping and making the case that I believe China would go in if we put pressure on them. We got almost 200 nations to join.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Deng Xiaoping died in 1997. No wonder Biden is so proud of negotiating the treaty with him, it's not easy to negotiate with a dead man.\\n\\nYou just watched the candidate who thinks he's going to win South Carolina, but he does have a rival on Saturday, Bernie Sanders. He is surging in South Carolina after his wins in Nevada and New Hampshire.\\n\\nLast night at a Town Hall at CNN, Sanders defended his many past comments praising Fidel Castro.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He initiated a major literacy program. There was a lot of -- a lot of folks in Cuba at that point, who are illiterate.\\n\\nYou know what? I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing.\\n\\nCHRIS CUOMO, CNN HOST: But there are Democrats who say you don't say good things about Fidel Castro. He destroyed freedoms in that country. He played -- picked winners and losers and killed them and put them in prison forever. You don't give them a pat on the back for anything.\\n\\nSANDERS: You don't get -- it's not a quiet -- truth is truth. All right.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Can you get elected President repeating the single dumbest talking point of the 1970s? We'll find out. Richard Goodstein is a lawyer and a former adviser to the Clintons. He joins us tonight. So how's your primary season going, Richard?\\n\\nRICHARD GOOSTEIN, FORMER ADVISER TO BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON: Can I just say one thing? I want to pat you on the back about your coverage of coronavirus and make a political point, which is not to be needlessly critical of Donald Trump, which is if you have an administration that treats science as a joke about climate change, when you take a Sharpie to a map, the whole public when your issue is science, it doesn't really have faith in you.\\n\\nSo I just wanted to again, commend you.\\n\\nCARLSON: I get it. From the party that doesn't believe in sonograms, you're going to lecture me about science, that thinks that people can change their gender by saying so.\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: I am not lecturing, I am just saying --\\n\\nCARLSON: That's science. That's hilarious.\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: If the public doesn't have confidence in Donald Trump around these issues, there's a reason for it. So here's my answer on how South Carolina is going.\\n\\nCARLSON: Science. I mean, I could ask you -- I actually -- I am interested in science and watching it be trampled. What do you think of the whole gender thing?\\n\\nI mean, let's have this conversation later. Let me ask you, you're a more moderate Democrat. You're worried about Bernie Sanders. You are for Klobuchar or Michael Bennet, but you're probably now, Biden is one of your last hopes. How do you think Joe Biden is doing and what is he running for tonight, do you know?\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: So I think, you know, you could show a lot of gaffes about Joe Biden. You could have done the same thing if you covered him decades ago. This is him.\\n\\nThe good news for Joe Biden is he says is, don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And he'd be running against somebody who thinks that Frederick Douglass has a great future, who thinks that an American invented the wheel, who cannot pronounce the word anonymous or origin.\\n\\nSo that's the virtue of where a Biden presidential candidacy will be relative to Donald Trump. Is he doing well? No.\\n\\nCARLSON: So do you think he is capable -- but sincerely, do you think he is capable of governing the country, an honest question right now, Joe Biden.\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: Yes, I think if you listen --\\n\\nCARLSON: It doesn't seem like he is.\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: Yes. I think that's a fair question. Look, he obviously knows what he is running for. When Donald Trump couldn't say Namibia, but he said Nambia, did I think he kind of knew that there was a Namibia? Yes.\\n\\nBut I'm just saying, of course, I think if you listen to Joe Biden, over hundreds of hours during this campaign answer questions about all the issues that he had to deal with in the White House, yes, I absolutely think he is quite capable.\\n\\nCARLSON: So what's your plan for the Bernie ascendancy? Are you going to stay in the country?\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: Yes.\\n\\nCARLSON: Switzerland? Like, have you gamed this out yet?\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: For the first time, Bernie is being vetted. Hillary gave him a pass. Huge mistake, I think in retrospect, and frankly, all the other Democrats so far have given him a pass.\\n\\nFinally, he's an unreconstructed socialist. He's talked about nationalizing telecommunications and banks and everything, and he means it.\\n\\nAgain, just like he said, good things about Castro. Trump has said good things about, you know, the head of North Korea and Turkey and you know, other authoritarians.\\n\\nI am not quite prepared to throw in the towel.\\n\\nCARLSON: It might happen. Washington is lobbying for Turkey. If that's disqualifying, you've got nowhere to have lunch with as you know.\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: I am saying, I'm not prepared to believe that Bernie Sanders is going to be the Democratic nominee.\\n\\nCARLSON: Okay.\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: I think people will throw a fit if he gets a plurality, but doesn't get the nomination. And I'd say go. Go whoever you're going to go with. We need somebody who is going to be a good Democrat, not what you are.\\n\\nCARLSON: Okay. I will visit you as you're being re-educated. That's my pledge to you.\\n\\nGOODSTEIN: Please do.\\n\\nCARLSON: Richard Goodstein. Good luck. Well, Comrade Sanders and Old Man Joe were not the only Democrats running for President and not the only ones embarrassing themselves.\\n\\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend is still in the race. He's trying to execute his plan to become the first lab created American President. Just how artificial is he? Can you see the wires beneath the latex exterior?\\n\\nConsider this we're going to show you an Obama speech, the former President from 2012. Then we're going to show you a Buttigieg speech from last Saturday and we're going to let you decide if there are any similarities between the two. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT: One voice can change a room. And if it can change a room, it can change the city.\\n\\nPETE BUTTIGIEG, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And we can light up a neighborhood and we can light up a city.\\n\\nOBAMA: And if we can change the city, it can change the state.\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: If we can light up a city, we can light up this whole country.\\n\\nOBAMA: And if it can change a state, it can change the nation.\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: And if we light up this country, then everyone can make sure this country will now shine as a beacon around the world once more.\\n\\nOBAMA: And if it can change a nation, it can change the world.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCARLSON: Tammy Bruce hosts Get Tammy Bruce on Fox Nation. She joins us tonight. Tammy, great to see you. So that clip made me feel old because I know Pete Buttigieg in his teens or whatever, but that Obama clip was from 2012 which wasn't that long ago. Apparently, Pete Buttigieg thinks no one is going to remember that.\\n\\nTAMMY BRUCE, FOX NATION HOST: Yes, it's a little insulting, isn't it? But more insulting might be when he changes -- the only unique thing about Pete at this point is his last name. But if he changes that to Obama, then he will have everything wrapped up perfectly.\\n\\nLook, this is a guy -- I mean, what else can you do now? But it's not just that. It's tweets that were similar with that speech. He was tweeting the same out, but it's also the cadence. It's not even just plagiarizing the words. It was the rhythm of the delivery, and even some of the gestures, the way that he held his face.\\n\\nThis is a guy who wants to be President, who doesn't even have the confidence to be himself. This is a man where there's apparently has no confidence in his own ideas or his own rhetoric or his own ability to inspire people.\\n\\nYou know, this is -- the only good thing here is, is that after Obama campaigned with platitudes like that, he actually got into the White House and failed. At this point, we can have the guy fail before he gets real power.\\n\\nSo we could have this do over and that's fine with me. It can also be like when you're dating someone and maybe, you're thinking about marrying them, and then you see on America's Most Wanted that he is really an escaped prisoner from a year ago and you find that out before you get married.\\n\\nThat's one of the other benefits. It's sad perhaps for the Pete supporters, but this is what I think also is insulting. He has got about I think 10 percent now black support in South Carolina. It is that he may believe here, that if he copies an African-American who is well regarded by the black communities here in America, that he can somehow trick them into voting for him.\\n\\nAnd I think that Americans, regardless of our skin color deserve a little bit more respect for that, a little bit more regard that everyone, regardless of our complexion, wants to hear real solutions about real issues on policy and this is where he is really dropping the ball to say the least.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, it is kind of the end of the road for identity politics. I mean, he is running on who he is rather than what he would do or what he believes in, but he's really going to have to for this to work, convince people that he is a biracial community organizer. I don't think he can pull that off.\\n\\nBRUCE: Well, that's it. I don't think he can, too. He wants to run as being who he is as a gay man, but then he also wants to run as being someone else. And that's really breaking the barrier when it comes to identity politics, isn't it?\\n\\nCARLSON: I agree. I'm glad you're insulted as I was. Tammy Bruce, great to see you tonight. Thank you.\\n\\nBRUCE: Thank you, sir.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, the judge in the Roger Stone case, an open partisan lashed out at this program today by name. We will tell you what she said and we'll respond to it after the break.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Last week on the show, we covered the sentencing of Roger Stone who is perhaps the most undeserving of all the casualties of the Russia collusion hysteria.\\n\\nStone received more than three years in prison. He'll be over 70 when he gets out. Officially his crime was lying about e-mails, e-mails that were themselves entirely harmless.\\n\\nFrom the first day, Stone's prosecution was a transparent political hit job. Washington wanted him in prison because for 40 years, he was Donald Trump's closest political adviser.\\n\\nAmy Berman Jackson is the Federal judge who oversaw the case. She was appointed by Barack Obama. She is an openly partisan Democrat. She has made no attempt to hide that.\\n\\nJackson allowed the foreman of the jury to lie about her political background which in a normal court of law would have disqualified her immediately. But Jackson let her stay and then defended her.\\n\\nThen Jackson herself lied about the case. She claimed that Stone had been prosecuted because he covered up for the President, when in fact the charges against Roger Stone had nothing to do with that.\\n\\nAmy Berman Jackson is a disgrace to the judiciary. It's frightening that in a country like ours, she has power and she does.\\n\\nWe said that on this show last week. Today, during a hearing, Jackson attacked us. And once again she lied as she did it.\\n\\nJackson accuses the show of invading the privacy of the foreman of the jury, when in fact the jury her herself has spoken publicly and revealed her own identity.\\n\\nMany media outlets published her name, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, all of which, of course, Jackson approves up because they're on her side.\\n\\nThen Jackson accused the show of harassing the jurors, even encouraging violence against them. That is insane. Of course, we did no such thing.\\n\\nFinally, Jackson called our criticism of her, antithetical to our system of justice. Which proves that not only is Amy Berman Jackson corrupt, dishonest and authoritarian, and she is definitely all of those things, she also has no sense of self-awareness whatsoever.\\n\\nJeanine Pirro hosts Justice with Judge Jeanine and she joins us tonight. Judge, thanks so much for coming on. Can you imagine a Federal judge in the middle of a very serious proceeding and the question in hand was does Roger Stone deserves a new trial because of the partisanship of the foreman of the jury.\\n\\nIn the middle of that, lashing out with political attacks against a TV show. She went after the President by name. What does that say about her?\\n\\nJEANINE PIRRO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Well, you know, Tucker, I sat as a Judge in criminal felony cases, as well. This is Federal.\\n\\nBut I am stunned at her behavior. Number one, any judge who concerns herself with the media or the press needs to get a thick skin or at least wear a few robes to make it look like she has thick skin. All right.\\n\\nShe should not be worried about you or anyone else. She's got a job and she needs to stay in her lane. But everything that you said about her is accurate and right on point.\\n\\nShe is a judge who should be outraged that a foreperson on a jury that convicted a man on seven counts may have lied to her, may have exhibited such jury bias that it would demand a new trial. But no, she is mad at you. She is mad at the President. She wants to have a hearing on whether or not there was jury bias in private because she doesn't want anyone intimidating the jury.\\n\\nWell, here's the bottom line, the juror foreperson herself outed herself. We know that she is an anti-Trump person. She has posted many things about Donald Trump, about Russia, about Roger Stone at least once and she is a partisan. She ran for Congress.\\n\\nThis is the kind of stuff that we seek to find out in a voir dire. This judge should be outraged not at anyone other than that juror. And the fact that she decided that she wouldn't recuse herself when she has already prejudged the issue by saying, this jury acted with integrity and intelligence. How do you know, judge? Have you spoken to that juror? Do you know what was posted? Do you know how she answered the question?\\n\\nWhat do you know about her background? Did she want to get on that jury? And everything in my gut tells me she wanted to get on that jury and denied doing anything that was partisan. Shame on the judge.\\n\\nCARLSON: Shame on the judge. She should be impeached. She's corrupt. She's out of control and she has also muzzled Roger Stone, taken away his First Amendment rights.\\n\\nHe's not allowed on this show. She's threatened to send him to prison if he defends himself. Meanwhile, he's being attacked daily by CNN. How can that happen in this country? I don't understand.\\n\\nPIRRO: We've never heard of anything like this. We've never heard of a defendant who has been convicted and sentenced and be then told he can't talk. His lawyers can't talk. We'll put them in jail. She is a partisan. She is the one who put Paul Manafort in solitary confinement when everybody I know in the legal community was -- why is he in solitary confinement?\\n\\nShe is a partisan. Everything that she has done including her refusal to recuse herself, not even having a hearing about that, criticizing you, when she should be worried about the fact that she has a juror foreperson who is out there saying, I am upset that the Attorney General decided that the sentence should be less.\\n\\nThis sentence, Miss Hart has nothing to do with you. You decide the facts. And this judge is on the wrong side of justice in this case. She has aligned herself with someone who may have disrupted justice in a courtroom. And she has prejudged it and taken the side of that person. It's wrong. It's wrong. And her whole history --\\n\\nCARLSON: It is terrifying that someone like that sits on a Federal bench. Roger Stone needs a pardon. And let's get past this. That's my view.\\n\\nJudge Jeanine, great to see you tonight. Thanks so much.\\n\\nPIRRO: Good to see you. Bye.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, with brutal housing costs and a severe epidemic of homelessness, Seattle has become San Francisco with worse weather. So what's the priority of lawmakers there?\\n\\nWell, of course, encouraging the intentional spread of the HIV virus. We're not joking by the way. We've got details after the break.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Washington State isn't quite as screwed up as the State of California. It's beautiful in a lot of parts, a lot of nice people there.\\n\\nBut lawmakers in Washington are trying their best to keep up with their southern neighbor. The statehouse there just approved a bill that, if passed, would downgrade the intentional transmission of HIV from a felony to a misdemeanor.\\n\\nJason Rantz is a Seattle area radio show host. He joins us tonight. Jason, thanks so much for coming on. So the word here is intentional. I think that that's the essential word. So they're saying that if you do -- if you infect someone with the disease for which there is no cure on purpose, that's a misdemeanor.\\n\\nJASON RANTZ, RADIO SHOW HOST: It will be when this bill passes and this bill is going to pass. All of the Democrats in the House said yes.\\n\\nLast night, there was a committee hearing in the Senate where all the Democrats again said yes. It's likely going to be passed in the coming days. So intentionality is the key here.\\n\\nThey're not talking about someone who has HIV, doesn't know about it and gives it to a sexual partner. They're talking about knowing your status and you're either choosing to lie about your status to the person you're engaging in sexual intercourse with, or just not telling them.\\n\\nOf course, the reason why you wouldn't tell someone is the fear that they're not going to give you any consent. So the state that talks about affirmative consent when it comes to HIV infection, all of a sudden they're saying, oh, you know, it's not that important.\\n\\nThe reason that they give behind this is what's most troubling to me. So they argue that by treating HIV as a negative by criminalizing HIV, that you're stigmatizing people who are living with HIV. That's a ludicrous argument.\\n\\nWe're stigmatizing people who choose to infect someone else with HIV. And they say, well, you know, Science and Medicine is so much different now that you can take a one a day pill, and you're basically going to be okay. So it's not that big of a deal to have HIV. That's their argument, which of course, there's certainly truth to the point of Medicine and how it's no longer the death sentence it once was.\\n\\nBut tell that to someone whose life has been completely impacted having take that pill a day, assuming they can afford the medication over their lifetime. Because when you look at the studies that suggests and depending on when you get it and how long you live, you're doing $500,000.00 to a million dollars over your lifetime, just on HIV medication.\\n\\nSo it's not like --\\n\\nCARLSON: But that's not it -- I mean, even at the level of principle, it's like completely insane that that one illness has been politicized. So it's hard to see clearly, but intentionally transmitting any illness to another person on purpose.\\n\\nRANTZ: Yes.\\n\\nCARLSON: Wouldn't that be a crime? I mean, can they hear themselves talk when they say this kind of thing?\\n\\nRANTZ: They try actually not to make it so that we can hear them talk. That's the problem. So this bill was kind of snuck in there. Not a lot of people were paying attention to it until we just caught wind of it and we talked about it on the show.\\n\\nAnd then all of a sudden, people started to complain about it and I spoke to a senator who told me that he had already pledged his support of this particular bill, but didn't actually read it or know what was inside of it.\\n\\nSo now, people know what's in this bill and it's on them. It's a morally reprehensible position to take that you're okay with lessening a crime of a monster who chooses to give someone HIV and to conflate that --\\n\\nCARLSON: So isn't -- or any disease -- so isn't intentionally infecting some of the disease, why is it different from bio warfare? A sincere question, why is that different?\\n\\nRANTZ: Yes, from their perspective, they see a victim class that this is being pushed by social justice Democrats, who see people living with HIV as victims that are in need of protection.\\n\\nAnd I generally agree that we obviously have to have compassion for people who are living with HIV, but we should not extend that compassion or understanding to criminals to go from a felony to a misdemeanor. And keep this in mind, in Washington State, particularly Western Washington, they don't prosecute misdemeanors.\\n\\nSo there's someone who's going to do this intentionally, and they're not going to be punished at all, all because Democrats want to protect her a larger group. It's absolutely ludicrous.\\n\\nCARLSON: Well, I'm for protecting people, too, particularly with HIV. I'm protecting everybody from crazy people who would intentionally if in fact the disease -- lunacy, hard to believe it's real. Apparently it is. Jason, thanks so much. Good to see you.\\n\\nRANTZ: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nCARLSON: A major coronavirus outbreak in this country is now inevitable. That's the finding of the C.D.C. today. So how do we respond? How is the Trump administration working to fight this? A member -- a key member of administration joins us to answer that question after the break.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCARLSON: Coronavirus is coming to this country on a large scale. We're not certain when, but the consensus among scientists is it is coming.\\n\\nSan Francisco has no cases yet reported. But the Mayor has already declared a state of emergency there. Coronavirus is a major test for our government. What is the response to the virus? Could the virus drive this country into a recession? And what exactly is administration doing to respond to all of this?\\n\\nPeter Navarro is one of the point men in the administration on coronavirus. He's the White House trade adviser, and he joins us now for answers. Peter, thanks so much for coming on.\\n\\nSo if you could sum up -- I assume you agree that this is a grave concern. The C.D.C., I think confirmed that today. What's the response to it?\\n\\nPETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE DIRECTOR: So Tucker, there's a four part strategy that we're pursuing in Trump time, which is to say as quickly as possible. You start with the personal protective equipment. This is the masks, and the gloves, the Tyvek suits, things like that that our public healthcare workers need. We're making sure that we can secure those supplies tomorrow. H.H.S. is going out with an RFP to secure a half a billion face masks alone.\\n\\nSecond thing is the treatment options. We've got three balls in the air on that. There's a drug called remdesivir which is administered intravenously, going through clinical trials. We're trying to secure the dosage for that. We're trying to develop oral antivirals in a very rapid time.\\n\\nAnd there's something called monoclonal antibodies which help build up the immune system. H.H.S. is working with a company called Regeneron on that.\\n\\nSo then the next thing, which is the magic bullet, that's the vaccine development. We've already set out a plan to develop a vaccine in less than half the time it usually takes with the combination of private sector efficiencies, and regulatory streamline and then finally, and importantly, there's point of care, diagnostics.\\n\\nThe problem, Tucker that we have now is if somebody has symptoms, they have to go to a hospital, take a sample, send it to a lab and wait 48 hours for that. What we're trying to do is adapt existing handheld devices to the coronavirus so that workers out in the field can get instant results.\\n\\nAnd Tucker, the President has been working on this from the day that he pulled down the planes from China on, I think, it was January 29th. We're focused like a laser beam on this to keep the public secure. We're hoping for the best, preparing for the worst and we're doing it all on Trump time.\\n\\nCARLSON: Interesting. Are you confident that the administration has a sense of how many people might be infected in the United States?\\n\\nNAVARRO: Yes, I am. The problem is what's going on in the rest of the world and how these vectors are going to impact us. But the issue here is to be ready, be prepared.\\n\\nThe important thing, Tucker, in contrasting this with the China situation is, if it comes here, what you want to do is stretch out the amount of time where people get contagious and infected, that will give our healthcare system the ability to process that.\\n\\nWhat's going on in China now is horrific. There's triage so that if you have anything but the coronavirus, heart attack, broken leg, whatever, you don't get care and you die. We don't want that to happen here obviously.\\n\\nCARLSON: It seems that -- no, we don't. Peter Navarro, thanks so much.\\n\\nNAVARRO: Thanks, Tucker.\\n\\nCARLSON: Good to see you. As we go tonight, we have a fixture on the screen. It is the birthday of our executive producer Justin Wells. We can't tell you how old he is because we don't know, but we do know he is the single best producer in all of television.\\n\\nHe's put on the show since the very first day and we are grateful to have him. He's the one on the other side. Happy birthday.\\n\\nThat's it for us tonight. Tune every night, eight o'clock, the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. A lot going on tonight. Sean Hannity takes over from here.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: He said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely I said that.\\n\\nI'm very proud of doing what I'm doing.\\n\\nWALLACE: With Nancy Pelosi back as speaker, we'll discuss the new challenges facing the president in this era of divided government with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\\n\\nAnd we'll find out what House Democrats hope to accomplish from congressional leader David Cicilline.\\n\\nPlus, President Trump takes incoming from both sides.\\n\\nSEN. MITT ROMNEY, R-UT: I haven't decided who I'm going to endorse in 2020. I'm going to wait to see what the alternatives are.\\n\\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: We are going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\\n\\nWALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about an even tougher road for the president in Washington.\\n\\nAnd our Power Players of the Week. Two new members of Congress and how they intend to work across the aisle to get things done.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For me, its mission. And when you are serving in the CIA and the military, you wake up everyday and you know what you're doing and why you're doing it, and I think it's no different in Congress.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got to start socializing together. The polarization, the balkanization has taken us apart.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right now on Fox News Sunday.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nWALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.\\n\\nPresident Trump now says the government shutdown could go on for months or even years. With the standoff over the border wall now in its third week, White House officials and congressional staffers met Saturday to work towards a deal, but prospects for a breakthrough remain dim as the new Democratic majority in the House seems determined to stand up to President Trump.\\n\\nIn a moment, we'll speak with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, but first, let's bring in Kevin Corke live at the White House with the latest on talks between the two sides -- Kevin.\\n\\nKEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, with no end to the shutdown in sight, top White House officials will join the president at Camp David today for a 2019 agenda strategy session, and as you can imagine, at the top of the list, ending the shutdown.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nCORKE: From the Situation Room, Rose Garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to Congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.\\n\\nSCHUMER: It's very hard to see how progress would be made unless they open up the government.\\n\\nCORKE: Now, 16 days into the shutdown, it is clear that despite increased face-to-face engagement, cooler heads haven't prevailed. In fact, the president turned up the heat, warning that he would consider using a national emergency to get his wall funding if Democrats won't budge.\\n\\nTRUMP: Absolutely. We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nCORKE: So, while the president stays here and then heads to Camp David, remaining in Washington will be Vice President Mike Pence. In fact, he will be here conducting yet another working discussion with congressional Democrats who, of course, are here with their staffers hoping to find a way, Chris, to end the shutdown.\\n\\nWALLACE: Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thank you.\\n\\nAnd joining me now here in the studio, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\\n\\nSarah, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\\n\\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Great to be with you.\\n\\nWALLACE: So. What is the latest on the negotiations? Did they make any progress yesterday?\\n\\nSANDERS: Well, they made some progress yesterday. The fact that they're sitting down at the table is some progress, in and of itself. But, they've got a long way to go. I mean, Democrats set down, the first thing that one of the individuals from the Democrats' side said in the meeting was, we're not here to make an agreement.\\n\\nSo, this was the beginning of a conversation that still has I think a lot left to be worked out. They're going to meet again later this afternoon, and hopefully, they'll continue to make progress and continue to move the ball down the field.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, though, Democrats have said over and over again that they support border security, that they support protecting American citizens -- now, it's time to fulfill some of those statements that they've made -- work with the president, let's get this done; let's open the government back up.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, of course, the question is -- is the wall the best way to do it? And I'm going to ask you about that in a minute.\\n\\nBut again, going back to Friday, the president meant what he said, that he is prepared to fight for the wall, to continue the shutdown for months or even years?\\n\\nSANDERS: Well, I think that's one of the things that people misunderstand. The president's not fighting for the wall; he's fighting for the protection of American citizens.\\n\\nWe cannot --\\n\\nWALLACE: But he wants the wall to do that.\\n\\nSANDERS: Absolutely. He wants the wall and he wants a number of other things. We have a completely broken immigration system. We have national crisis, not just of safety and security, but a humanitarian crisis.\\n\\nWe have drugs, we have human traffickers, we have terrorists that come across our border and there has to be a stop to that and we want to do -- not just the wall; certainly that's one of the most important factors. We know that it works; we know that in the places that it's been, it's 95 percent effective.\\n\\nWe want to be effective across the board and that includes the wall and other technology along the --\\n\\nWALLACE: But you're not answering my question. He meant what he said. He's prepared to continue this fight, this shutdown, for months or even years?\\n\\nSANDERS: Absolutely, the president means what he says when he says that. But it would be outrageous for Democrats who agree with the president -- that's what's the most outrageous thing to me, and something that frankly is so just incomprehensible -- they agree with the president. They agree that we need border security. They just are unwilling to let this president win.\\n\\nAnd I think at some point they have to decide that they care more about Americans than fighting the president. And so far, we haven't seen a willingness on their side to fully do that.\\n\\nWALLACE: But let's talk about caring about Americans, because House Democrats this week passed six bills that would fund eight agencies, unrelated to Homeland Security, unrelated to the wall, that would get them back going right now.\\n\\nAnd the question is, why not sign that bill, fund those agencies that have nothing to do with the border wall, and not hold those hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and the services they provide, hostage?\\n\\nSANDERS: We're not holding anybody hostage. The president wants to fund the government; he wants to open the government --\\n\\nWALLACE: But you could open those eight other agencies.\\n\\nSANDERS: Chris, we've been having this debate for years. At some point, we have to say, enough is enough. Until we can come together, we can be reasonable, which we have put forth in good faith multiple offers to Democrats to say, let's make a deal. Let's have a discussion; let's get to a place where we agree.\\n\\nWe have to stop kicking the can down the road and just continuing to say, let's do it again in 30 days. Let's do it in 45 days.\\n\\nLet's do it now.\\n\\nWALLACE: No, no, no. But do you -- but I'm not talking about Homeland Security. That -- you can continue to fight about that, if you want, and you shut it down -- but why hold agriculture hostage? Why hold justice hostage? Why hold the Treasury Department hostage?\\n\\nWhy not fund them? They have nothing to do with a border wall.\\n\\nSANDERS: The president wants to do this all at once. He knows it's better if they can focus on getting all of these packages done at one time.\\n\\nWALLACE: Isn't the real reason, because you want the leverage from all the agencies?\\n\\nSANDERS: It's not just -- it's not that. But you also have to look at the six bills. Those aren't the budget that we submitted, either. There are a lot of discrepancies between what we --\\n\\nWALLACE: Those have all been approved by Republicans in the Senate.\\n\\nSANDERS: They have. I'm not saying we oppose those six. I'm just saying, to make it like this is an easy deal; we want to be able to negotiate, but at the same time you can't just keep passing the buck. This is a major point of contention. And let's just sit down and work it out.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK. But if this shutdown lags on, not months or years, but even in to February, it's going to start to hurt real people.\\n\\nTake a look at this, Sarah. Federal tax refunds will be delayed. Food stamps for 38 million Americans will be cut. Millions of people will lose rental assistance payments and union leaders say hundreds of TSA workers are already off the job because they can't afford to get to work. President Trump thinks the border wall is worth all of that?\\n\\nSANDERS: Look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. But you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? He never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to Officer Singh of California's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. This shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.\\n\\nEvery life -- that's what sets America apart from every other country; we value life. That it's what makes us unique. And the day that we stop doing that, even if it's one, 10 or 100,000, that's when we stop being the greatest country on the face of this earth.\\n\\nNot only people like that, but we also have a massive influx of drugs that come across the southern border. Ninety percent of the heroin that comes into this country comes across through the southern border and 300 Americans are killed from that every single month.\\n\\nWALLACE: But let's talk --\\n\\nSANDERS: We have to look at it across the board.\\n\\nWALLACE: Let's talk about the wall. Because there is no question that there has been a big spike in the number of family units coming across the border.\\n\\nThe president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border. And here is Secretary of Homeland Security Nielsen. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nKIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: The CBP has stopped over 3,000 what we call Special Interest Aliens trying to come into the country in the southern border. Those are aliens who the intel community has identified are of concern.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: But Special Interest Aliens are just people who come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist. They're not terrorists themselves. And the State Department says that there is, quote, their words: no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from Mexico.\\n\\nSANDERS: We know that roughly, nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.\\n\\nWALLACE: Wait, wait, wait -- I know the statistic; I didn't know you were going to use it. But I studied up on this.\\n\\nDo you know where those 4,000 people come -- where they're captured? Airports.\\n\\nSANDERS: Not always.\\n\\nWALLACE: At airports.\\n\\nSANDERS: Certainly a large number --\\n\\nWALLACE: The State Department says there hasn't been any terrorists that they've found coming across the southern border with Mexico.\\n\\nSANDERS: It's by air, it's by land and it's by sea. It's all of the above. But one thing that you're forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border, and we have to protect it.\\n\\nAnd the more individuals that --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: But they're not coming across the southern border, Sarah. They're coming and they're being stopped at airports.\\n\\nSANDERS: They're coming a number of ways. They're certainly -- I'm not disagreeing with you that they're coming through airports. I'm saying that they come by air, by land and by sea.\\n\\nAnd the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do American citizens harm.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK. The president now says, and this was a revelation on Friday, that he can go around Congress and build this wall on his own. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: We can call a national emergency, because of the security of our country, absolutely. No, we can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it. But we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: How serious is he about that? Has the White House drafted an emergency order? A resolution that he could, that he could -- that he could announce tomorrow -- we're going to declare a national emergency; we're going to build the wall. Has he set a deadline for when he's going to end talks and simply say, I'm going to go off on my own and do it? And is he really prepared --\\n\\nSANDERS: That's a lot of questions.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, three.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Is he really prepared -- it's still the same question, which is - - how serious is he? Is he really prepared to go off on his own and use money that was authorized for military construction and build a wall instead?\\n\\nSANDERS: The president's prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders, to protect the people of this country; he knows that the number one job he has as president and commander-in-chief is to protect its citizens. And if he doesn't take that seriously, whether it's at our southern border or whether it's from terrorists coming from whatever way they come, or any other place that --\\n\\nWALLACE: And does he really think he has --\\n\\nSANDERS: -- they can try to do harm to Americans, then he is not going to be the president that he knows himself to be, and he has shown himself to be over the last two years.\\n\\nWALLACE: And he really, just quickly -- does he really think that he has the authority to build the wall with funds that were appropriated for the military construction without congressional approval?\\n\\nSANDERS: As we've said for the last several weeks, we're looking and exploring every option available that the president has, whether --\\n\\nWALLACE: And is that a viable option?\\n\\nSANDERS: Whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful and we're looking at every option we can. This is something the president takes incredibly seriously, is very passionate about, and is not going to stop until he figures out the best way to make sure we're doing everything we can to make America safer and more secure.\\n\\nWALLACE: I've got less than a minute left.\\n\\nPresident Trump is at Camp David today to meet with White House senior officials about his priorities for 2019.\\n\\nWhat can you tell us about the meeting and about what his agenda is?\\n\\nSANDERS: We had an incredible first two years under the President Trump. The economy is strong. ISIS has been on the run. The judiciary is being made.\\n\\nWe have just a number of successes over these first two years. We want to look at how we're going to continue to build on those as we move into 2020.\\n\\nWALLACE: Top priority?\\n\\nSANDERS: I think the president's got a lot. Immigration certainly has to be at the forefront. Right now, that's one of the biggest things that we have to get done is securing our border.\\n\\nBut not just securing the border, but fixing the immigration system as a whole; it's completely broken. The president wants to make sure we look at all of the different things, loopholes we can close, to make that better. Infrastructure, fighting the opioid crisis -- those are going to be things that also not only are the president's big priorities, but things we think we might be able to get Democrats to actually work with us.\\n\\nThe American people elected them to come here and do more than just fight the president and we hope that they'll fulfill their constituents' hopes for them and do exactly that.\\n\\nWALLACE: Sarah, thank you.\\n\\nSANDERS: Thank you.\\n\\nWALLACE: Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk to you.\\n\\nSANDERS: Always great to be here.\\n\\nWALLACE: Up next, reaction from a top House Democrat - what's their plan to end the shutdown? And what about those calls to impeach the president?\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: House Democrats have an ambitious agenda as they take over the majority from infrastructure to health care, to investigations of the Trump administration. But their first priority is to end the government shutdown.\\n\\nJoining us now from Rhode Island, one of their new leaders, Congressman David Cicilline, chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\\n\\nCongressman, what's the latest on where negotiations stand? Are your -- is your side willing to compromise with the president on the border wall, or are you, in effect, demanding his surrender?\\n\\nREP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: No, I don't think we are demanding a surrender, but what we're demanding is that the government be reopened. We passed appropriations bill that were passed unanimously by the Senate. They were supported by Republicans. There was an agreement on those bills.\\n\\nThe president at the last moment changed his mind and that deal fell apart. So, we are trying to isolate the disagreement. So, we passed again the Senate approved version that -- it was the Republican path forward. That passed the House in a bipartisan way with Republicans and Democrats. We sent that to the Senate.\\n\\nWhat we are saying is open of the government. We'll have a short-term extension so we can resolve this disagreement. But we need to reopen the government and the president has really held this --\\n\\nWALLACE: I just --\\n\\nCICILLINE: I'm sorry.\\n\\nWALLACE: Let me just interrupt for a second, because Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Schumer have been hinting at this on Friday after the meeting, is that the Democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government?\\n\\nCICILLINE: I mean, I think we believe the government must reopen immediately. I mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the TSA. I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.\\n\\nAnd so, what we are saying is open the government. There's agreement, bipartisan agreement on funding the government. Let's isolate the disagreement, the Department of Homeland Security and continue talking.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Let's talk about the merits of a border wall. Here's what new Speaker Nancy Pelosi says.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We are not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? The wall, in my view, is an immorality. It is, again, a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the American people. But it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: I want to ask you a specific question, Congressman, why is a wall immoral? I'm not asking why it's ineffective or why you think the money could be spent better, but the speaker keeps saying the wall is immoral. There's a wall or a fence around the White House. People build walls around their homes.\\n\\nWhy is a border wall immoral?\\n\\nCICILLINE: I think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders. We have appropriated $1.7 billion over the last two years for border security. The department has spent less than 6 percent. But we are prepared to do more because we need to do more, but we want to do it in a way that's effective.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: If I may just press, why is a wall immoral?\\n\\nCICILLINE: Well, that's a question the speaker will have to answer, but I think what she means by that is it doesn't reflect our values as a country, that America has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants, people who are fleeing violence and war.\\n\\nBut I think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. It doesn't achieve the objective. Democrats are committing to securing our borders. We have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK.\\n\\nCICILLINE: But let's use technology, let's use drones, let's use satellites, let's do cargo inspections, which aren't happening. Let's do things that will actually secure the border.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK. But let's talk about the effectiveness of it. Brandon Judd is the president of the National Border Patrol Council. He's been a border patrol agent for 21 years. Here's what he says.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBRANDON JUDD, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Anywhere that you look where we have built walls, they have worked. They have been an absolute necessity for border patrol agents in securing the border.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Here's a guy who has been on the front lines, on the border for two decades. He says border walls work.\\n\\nCICILLINE: Well, look, I think there's no question there are places we have walls and fencing and other kind of barriers. I think good border security is going to be a combination of things. But what we've heard of from the president is he wants a big great concrete wall that will be a thousand miles --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: No, no, he's given up on the concrete wall. He is talking about steel fencing out.\\n\\nCICILLINE: But I think the reality is this is actually a fight the president has created to distract from the real issues that he's facing. The fact is the Republicans were in control of the House, the Senate and the White House for two years.\\n\\nAnd if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why? Because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. His foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. The gentleman heading the ISIS effort resigned.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK.\\n\\nCICILLINE: It was a bad couple of weeks. So what does the president do? He shuts the government down and he's distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown.\\n\\nWALLACE: But, sir, the fact is, even The Washington Post today said that there is now a crisis at the border. There has been a dramatic spike in the number of family units coming across the southern border.\\n\\nI want to put up some statistics. In November of 2017, a year plus ago, the border patrol apprehended 7,000 family units at our southwest border. This past November, two months ago, they caught 25,000 family units coming across.\\n\\nAnd look at these recent incidents were border patrol agents had to fire tear gas at migrants who were trying to climb the fence and who were throwing rocks at the border agents.\\n\\nI mean, Congressman, the president is not making this up.\\n\\nCICILLINE: No, the reality is this is a complicated problem. It requires a sophisticated answer and I think the incoming chief of staff for the president and the outgoing chief of staff have both set up border wall doesn't solve this problem.\\n\\nWe need to have comprehensive immigration reform. We need to have additional personnel. We need to use technology. So we want to secure our border and respond to these challenges but we want to do it in a way that works, a way that will achieve the objective.\\n\\nAnd so, what we are saying to the president is open up the government. These other departments have nothing to do with this. Do not punish the American people by shutting down government if you don't get your way.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. I got --\\n\\nCICILLINE: And --\\n\\nWALLACE: Let me just interrupt because I have two minutes left and I want to get to questions in.\\n\\nCICILLINE: Sure.\\n\\nWALLACE: The president said on Friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from Sarah Sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. If he goes ahead and does that, what will House Democrats like yourself do?\\n\\nCICILLINE: Well, I don't think the president has that authority. He would have to meet a very high standard. Article One establishes the Congress of the United States and gives us the responsibility of appropriating money.\\n\\nSo I don't think the president has the authority to do that, and I hope you will continue to try to work with Congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first. This -- the government will reopen when the Republicans in the Senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn't be shutting down the government if they don't get their way.\\n\\nWALLACE: Finally, I've got less than a minute, finally, freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib -- and I know you were expecting this question -- of Michigan said this on Thursday night.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: When your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won. Bullies don't win. And I said, baby, they don't, because we're going to go in there and we're going to the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\\n\\n(CHEERS)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: What do you think of the language and what do you think of the idea of moving right away to impeach President Trump?\\n\\nCICILLINE: Well, look, Democrats ran on the agenda for the people, to drive down health care costs, drive down the cost of prescription drugs, raise family incomes by rebuilding American.\\n\\nWALLACE: I got all of that and I got a little time but specifically --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCICILLINE: Look, I think we need to move forward on our agenda. At the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. I'm one of the people who think we have to wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.\\n\\nWALLACE: And really quick, yes or no, do you condemn that language?\\n\\nCICILLINE: Look -- I'm not going to -- look, it's kind of odd to hear people on the Republican side who have not condemned the president's language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language. Like, look, this is a private event, she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate. The fundamental issues Democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we're going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives, and we're going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way.\\n\\nWALLACE: Congressman Cicilline, thank you. Thanks for your time, sir. Please come back.\\n\\nCICILLINE: I will. Thanks for having me.\\n\\nWALLACE: Up next, how long will the shutdown drag on? We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the deadlock and when most Americans will start feeling the pain.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Coming up, the shutdown over the border wall tests the new divide in Washington.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: Without a wall, you cannot have border security.\\n\\nPELOSI: We're not doing the wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the political power struggle, next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: The southern border is a dangerous, horrible disaster. We've done a great job, but you can't really do the kind of job we have to do unless you have a major powerful barrier.\\n\\nPELOSI: We recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government. And we made that very clear to the president.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: President Trump and House Speaker Pelosi giving no sign of progress in talks to end the partial government shutdown and resolve the fight over funding for a border wall.\\n\\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, Marie Harf, co-host of Benson and Harf on Fox News Radio, and Jonah Goldberg of The National Review.\\n\\nCongressman Chaffetz, there was an interesting development in the last couple of days. A few -- three, as I could them, Senate Republicans who were up for re-election in 2020 are now beginning to break with the president and say, we need to reopen the government. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine, Tom Tillis of North Carolina.\\n\\nHow do you see this shutdown ending? When do you see this shutdown ending?\\n\\nJASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and I hope it's sooner rather than later. But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.\\n\\nAnd I'm sensitive to Cory Gardner, who's a great member of the United States Senate, but now is the -- Congress always gravitates to deadlines and pressure points. And that's what I think is ultimately going to get this solved is the need, the desire to solve this now rather than continuing to punt it down the road.\\n\\nWALLACE: Mo, are the Democrats the one who were in a hole and are going to need to get out of it?\\n\\nMO ELLEITHEE, CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. I think most Americans would agree that this is the president's shutdown and that the president is basically holding hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage over -- over this. And it's not just them. It's the people who contract with the federal government, people who aren't getting paid, people who are worried about paying the bills, people who are worried about paying their rent, people who may get stuck at airports. This is all -- these are the pressure points that are really going to move this.\\n\\nAnd I think to say that you're going to continue this for years over an argument, an immigration argument that is actually not proven to be effective, that is sort of in -- where there has bene a wall, we have seen breaches time and time again, almost 10,000 breaches among certain sectors of the wall that exist now. Rather than taking that money and investing in actual technologies that would provide real border security, investigating in more Border Patrol agents, that, to me, seems like a better way to go.\\n\\nTo keep the government shutdown and hurt all these people over kind of a fantasy answer I think is going to come back and hurt the president.\\n\\nWALLACE: I'll let you answer about the fencing answer. But -- but, I mean, here's the problem it seems to me. If the -- if Nancy Pelosi were to say tomorrow, all right, we're going to give you the money for the wall, she'd be thrown out as speaker. Her -- her House Democratic caucus would not stand for that. If the president were to say, you know what, I give up on the wall, his political base, that 39, 40 percent would turn on him.\\n\\nWhere does the pressure come and is going to be a surrender by one side to the other? Are they going to sort of lay down the instruments of war? Or is there going to be a compromise that involves something that the president ends up giving to Democrats, whether it's on DACA, the dreamers, people with temporary protected status,, whatever?\\n\\nJONAH GOLDBERG, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, so that' -- that's part of the irony here, right, is the fight over this is almost purely symbolic now. It is a, if they win, we lose, zero sum understanding that if Trump gets anything he can claim victory for, Democrats will feel like it's a loss, and vice versa.\\n\\nThe irony is, is that there are serious public policy compromises that could be found here on DACA. There are serious restriction, like my friend Mark Krikorian (ph), who argued for, you know, things like e-verify that are much more important than a wall. But the problem is --\\n\\nWALLACE: And, incidentally, e-verify is -- is not --\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Shut down right now. Yes.\\n\\nWALLACE: Right. It's shut down as a part of the government shutdown. That's the system that -- that people can use to check as to whether somebody's in the country legally or not.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Right. And so I -- to answer the question about the pressure point thing, it seems to me that if you actually end up -- right now it's a lot of posturing from the TSA and their union. But it seems to me that if - - if -- if airports start essentially shutting down and rip people out and the rest of the country start to feel the bite, that is where I think the pressure really starts to build. That moves markets. That's going to cause congressman to start buckling.\\n\\nRight now overflowing garbage cans on the mall is not exactly -- I drove past it this morning. It's not exactly like a scene from a Mad Max movie out there. But as time goes by, I think those are the pressure points. And you can see a lot of senators get weak in the knees about it.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right, I'm -- I'm going to ask all of you for a prediction in a moment, but if not for the shutdown, the big political story this week would be the House going back to the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi regaining the speakership after eight years in the minority, in the first speaker to regain the gavel since Sam Rayburn in the 1950s.\\n\\nHere she was on Thursday.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPELOSI: I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unifying, that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this chamber and across divisions across our nation.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Marie, whatever you think of her policies, Nancy Pelosi is clearly a heck of a politician. How effective do you think she'll be dealing with President Trump on this and other issues?\\n\\nMARIE HARF, ANALYST: Absolutely. And I -- I think I was one of those Democrats that underestimated her ability to win back the speakership with the kind of numbers she got. The fact that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez voted for her in the end is just a symbol of the fact that she was able to win back that speakership in a way that showed her strength and her legislative ability.\\n\\nThe two things the Democratic House have done now legislatively, they've introduced a bill to -- on voting rights, to get corruption out of Washington, and they've passed bills to reopen the government. So I think they put down a marker this week that they are not here to play. They have an agenda. They're going to push it forward.\\n\\nShe will have, I think, some challenges bringing together this moderate block of Democrats who re-won the House in places like Michigan. Elissa Slotkin, coming up later on the show, she's one of them. She is a moderate. She is not an abolish ICE Democrat. Combine that with AOC and the liberal wing of the party, going into a presidential election --\\n\\nWALLACE: AOC, folks --\\n\\nHARF: That is now how we refer to Alexander Ocasio-Cortez. It's like JFK or LBJ, AOC.\\n\\nHARF: Exactly. Thank you.\\n\\nBut I think, you know, if we've seen anything from Nancy Pelosi in the few months since Democrats retook the House, it's that she can bring those members together. And as long as Donald Trump's in the White House, I think she's going to be pretty effective. And she's shown that this week in holding the line.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK, we got a minute left in this segment and I want to ping-pong back and forth and get your predictions.\\n\\nOn Friday, as it goes into the 21st day, if it does, the shutdown would be the longest in history, midnight Friday. Will we, a week from today, will the shutdown still be going on? And when it ends, which side is going to be seen as winning?\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: Still going on and I think the next pressure point is actually the State of the Union at the end of January. I think if -- you will see some --\\n\\nWALLACE: So that's like January 29th?\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: Yes. I think it will continue on to -- to go on to that -- to that point.\\n\\nWALLACE: And who's going to win?\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: I think the Republicans are going to win. They're on the right side of the argument.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK.\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: Protecting our borders is the right side of the argument.\\n\\nWALLACE: Mo.\\n\\nELLEITHEE: I think it goes on probably for at least a couple more weeks. But I think the points that Jonah were making and others were making, when this starts to be felt in people's homes or in their community or in the airports --\\n\\nWALLACE: And who caves?\\n\\nELLEITHEE: The president will -- will -- will cave and Democrats will actually find a way to help him cave a little bit less painfully is -- is what's going to be really interesting.\\n\\nWALLACE: Marie.\\n\\nHARF: I actually hope that Democrats get something like DACA out of this. I don't want this to keep going on. But, you're right, the more real people that feel this, people that can't pay rent, if it goes on till the State of the Union, I think that's insane. That is crazy.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: I think it goes past the State of the Union --\\n\\nHARF: Oh, my God.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: And I think the living will envy the dead.\\n\\nNo, I think -- I do think it goes past the State of the Union and they will find a way for everyone to declare a victory.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, that's very sensible. And, actually, I do think that's true. I mean it can't be a complete surrender.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Right.\\n\\nHARF: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: It has to be the kind of compromise.\\n\\nAll right, panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, the living will envy the dead. President Trump takes incoming from both sides. A freshman Democrat makes an obscene call for his impeachment, and a longtime Republican rival arrives in Washington and wastes no time taking a shot.\\n\\nAnd what would you like to ask the panel about Mitt Romney's criticism of the president? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. MITT ROMNEY, R-UT: I've laid out time and again places where I disagree with the president.\\n\\nThey are places that relate to the, if you will, forming of national character that I think we can do a better job.\\n\\nTRUMP: If he fought really hard against President Obama, like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: President Trump responding to a brand-new Senator Mitt Romney, who wrote a controversial article this week saying the president has not risen to the mantle of the office, which understandably got a lot of attention.\\n\\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\\n\\nCongressman Chaffetz, you were -- are a former congressman from Utah. What do you make of -- of Mitt Romney, before he is even sworn in, having an op- ed in The Washington Post that -- that basically says this president is living -- not living up to his responsibilities as president, certainly in the image department, and what's the reaction been back home?\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: Well, this is not the -- candidate Romney didn't -- didn't talk like this. That's not who he was. He accepted his endorsement in October. In a debate he was asked a question and he said he's putting the past behind him. He looks to working forward.\\n\\nI think it was an unforced error. And he was elected to represent the state of Utah to solve problems. This didn't solve a problem, it created a problem. I think it was an unforced error.\\n\\nWALLACE: Why do you think he did it?\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: I think he does believe it. I think it's in his heart. But -- and I don't think that it's going to do anything to actually move the meter and accomplish things. I don't -- I don't know why he would do it before he was sworn in. I think a lot of people are scratching their head.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on Romney's criticism of President Trump. Mike Johnson sent this on FaceBook. When is he switching to the Democratic Party, because he obviously is no longer a Republican? And Jean Caragher tweeted this, is he positioning himself to challenge President Trump for the 2020 nomination?\\n\\nMarie, how do you answer them?\\n\\nHARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.\\n\\nI don't think Mitt Romney's going to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. That's just my instinct. I do think John Kasich might. I think Jeff Flake might. And a lot will depend on the Mueller report. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and once we get that, I think you'll see some Republicans make some decisions about that primary.\\n\\nWALLACE: Then there was, and we talked about this before with Congressman Cicilline, Congresswoman -- freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and her attack this week on the president, her obscene attack, and President Trump's response.\\n\\nTake a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: We're going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\\n\\nTRUMP: I think she dishonored herself and I think she dishonored her family.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Jonah, this clearly, in the very first week that the House Democrats took over and had done a lot of very careful things in terms of messaging, stepped on their message, the fact that we're talking about it, the fact that cable news has feasted on this. And I think, one, what do you think of that, and, two, the fact that this really indicate how much trouble Nancy Pelosi is going to have controlling some of the firebrands in her party?\\n\\nGOLDBERG: No, I think that's right. I think there are two issues here. One, the expletive, which she should have apologized for and just moved on. I don't think President Trump has an enormous amount of credibility condemning that kind of language or debasing discourse in any way.\\n\\nBut then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. And Nancy Pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides Republicans, that peels off Republicans. And the one thing that will keep Republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the Mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. If it just becomes -- if the Democratic Party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the Republican Party, which I think is a real concern, of just the anti-Trump party, than that will unify the Republicans.\\n\\nAnd so get -- staying quiet about impeachment is totally in Nancy Pelosi's and the Democrat's long-term interest until there's a reason to actually talk about impeachment.\\n\\nWALLACE: I mean, in fairness, we heard Congressman Cicilline today say exactly that, and Jerry Nadler, who is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which is where this issue of impeachment, if it's going to come up, would come up, said the same thing this week.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Right.\\n\\nWALLACE: So --\\n\\nGOLDBERG: But it's a problem. But that's not with the rank and file want, right? In the same way that the Rank and file of the Republican Party wants it to be an always Trump all Trump party, the rank and file of the Democratic Party wants it to be an always anti-Trump party here.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, let me ask Mo about that.\\n\\nOne, what do you make of Tlaib's statement, plus her refusal afterwards to apologize? And how much of a fever is there in the House Democratic Caucus to move right now and impeach Donald Trump?\\n\\nELLEITHEE: So, on the comment, I'd -- I'd -- I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with anything Jonah said. The -- I spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and I think that is wrong and I don't think Democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize Democrats for acting like him. So I wish he wouldn't have used that language.\\n\\nBut I do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment.\\n\\nGOLDBERG: Right.\\n\\nELLEITHEE: And I do think it is premature. I think most members of House Democratic leadership agree with that. Most members of House Democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way Tom Steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. There may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and Bob Mueller will let everyone know when that time is.\\n\\nBut, until then, Democrats have a policy agenda to push. They've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. And they have an election to win. If they want to beat Donald Trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. They've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. That should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.\\n\\nWALLACE: We've got about a minute left, Marie.\\n\\nThere was a very interesting moment on Friday because President Trump came out to the Rose Garden after his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on Democrats who want to impeach.\\n\\nHARF: I think that's right, but they always condition it -- always, always -- in the leadership of the Democratic caucus right now on the Mueller report. That we cannot do this for political reasons, like it appeared with Bill Clinton or like Tom Steyer is doing. So I think they will keep it on the table conditioned on Mueller.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.\\n\\nUp next, our Power Players of the Week. We're going to introduce you to two new members of Congress and ask how they plan to reach across the aisle and end the shutdown.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: With the old guard in Washington not getting much done, we met this week with two new members of the 116 Congress to get their fresh ideas. We sat down with Democrat Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who served three tours in Iraq with the CIA, and with Republican Mark Green of Tennessee, who was on the special ops team that captured Saddam Hussein. And they are our Power Players of the Week.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nWelcome to Fox News Sunday.\\n\\nREP. MARK GREEN, R-TENN.: We're delighted to be here. Thanks, Chris.\\n\\nREP. ELISSA SLOTKIN, D-MICH.: Thanks for having us.\\n\\nWALLACE: You both talk about trying to get things done, trying to compromise, to break the gridlock in Washington. Be specific.\\n\\nLet me start with you, Congresswoman Slotkin. How?\\n\\nSLOTKIN: Sure. Well, the perfect example is the government shutdown right now. We have the basis of a deal, right? Both sides are saying they care about border security. They believe in national security. Start having a real negotiation about border security, border forces, more technology at the border, fencing if we needed it in some areas. It doesn't just have to be a wall. That's the essence of a negotiation.\\n\\nSo I think we can start now if people really care about getting something done.\\n\\nWALLACE: You're talking about the issues, I guess I'm talking more about attitude. Because it's -- you know, there are problems there and people have known about possible deals, possible solutions for a long time, but it never gets done. Why not?\\n\\nGREEN: I think what we, as a class, the freshman class, brings, particularly the congresswoman and I, is, you know, a life of service to the country. You know, she's prior military, I'm prior military and we want solutions. And we're just sick and tired of it not happening. And our constituents sent us here to get it done. So we're -- we're rolling up our sleeves and going to -- going to get it done.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, I want to pick up on that because Congressman Green was a special operations flight surgeon in Iraq, part of the capture of Saddam Hussein. You served for years in the CIA, then for Presidents Bush 43 and Obama, a Republican and Democrat. What's the one thing that you think you can take from your service in national security and maybe help you here in Washington?\\n\\nSLOTKIN: I mean, for me, it's mission, right? You have a mission. And when you're serving in the CIA or military, you wake up every day, you know what you're doing and why you're doing it. And I think it's no different in Congress. Some people have treated it as if they don't have a mission, that they're there for themselves, they're show horses, whatever. I think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing.\\n\\nWALLACE: There are a lot of very well-intentioned people in that building behind me and somehow it doesn't get done.\\n\\nLet's take the shutdown. The wall that the president says has to be a wall or, you know, some version of a wall. You hear Nancy Pelosi say a wall is immoral. How do you compromise from that kind of rhetoric?\\n\\nGREEN: I think we find, you know, some common ground with what is border security and we get it done. I mean that's really what we have to do. And, you know, the president has looked at this and has said, this is what we need to do and, you know, I'm supporting him in this -- in this effort.\\n\\nSLOTKIN: I just think it -- literally, life is about negotiations. There is no one who lives their lives just saying I'm going to unilaterally decide what happen. So, negotiate. Get in the room, kick out the cameras and get something done.\\n\\nWALLACE: Where are you both on Donald Trump?\\n\\nQuestion for you, Congresswoman Slotkin, are the Democrats, particularly in the House, too anti-Trump?\\n\\nSLOTKIN: I think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that I love. And, for me, that's critically important. I don't like policy by Twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. If we're only anti-Trump, we are not doing our job.\\n\\nWALLACE: On the other hand, congressman, you said during the campaign you can't imagine an issue where you would differ with Donald Trump.\\n\\nGREEN: So far every action he's taken has been spectacular, from cutting taxes that created massive growth at least in our state in Tennessee, to one of the biggest pay raises for our veterans -- our soldiers in -- in ten plus years. You know, I -- I think the actions that he's taken are spectacular and I can't see an area where I would disagree with him at this point.\\n\\nWALLACE: What about the tone?\\n\\nGREEN: I think maybe in some cases there are better ways to say things. But, again, I 100 percent support the actions that have been taken.\\n\\nWALLACE: Over the next two years, and I'll start with you congresswoman, how confident are you that you're going to be able to change Washington instead of Washington changing you?\\n\\nSLOTKIN: I think the nice thing is, we have over 100 new members in a body of 435 people. Any organization with that many new people, the culture changes. So I'm not saying it's going to be easy, and I've seen it already, you know, that sucking sound of people trying to get you to be very political, you know, salute the party instead of the country. You've got to be strong enough to push back. And that happens when you have people that you can link arms with and say, no, we're not going to do it that way, and I think we have that.\\n\\nGREEN: I came from a dirt road in a small rural town. My friends are not going to let me go off the rails. Many years in the military. You know, the night stalkers that I went to combat with are going to be on the phone with me saying, Mark, what -- what are you thinking if I -- if I do make the wrong decision or go the wrong way.\\n\\nTip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan would fight like cats and dogs in the daytime and in the evening they'd go out as Irishmen and have a scotch. And we've got to get back to doing that. And that's how we become friends. Maybe not agreeing, but -- but those relationships I think are what's really missing right now and something that I want to be a part of fixing.\\n\\nWALLACE: Congresswoman Slotkin, do you like scotch?\\n\\nSLOTKIN: You know, I'm going to suggest Michigan beer. You might want to try it. But --\\n\\nGREEN: Tennessee whiskey.\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. We'll leave it there.\\n\\nYou see, can't even agree on that.\\n\\nSLOTKIN: Never.\\n\\nWALLACE: Congresswoman, congressman, thank you both.\\n\\nGREEN: Thanks for having us.\\n\\nWALLACE: Good luck.

{"original": "It's probably America's most controversial list. You can be put on it without your knowledge, and getting off it is extremely difficult.\\n\\nIt's the federal no-fly list, a collection of names of people who are not allowed to board commercial flights into or out of the United States. According to leaked documents obtained by The Intercept, more than 47,000 people were on America's no-fly list as of August 2013. That number reportedly includes 800 Americans, many of whom don't even know they're on it. The government sends no official notification to those on the list; many times, people don't find out until they're denied boarding at the airport.\\n\\nA number of high-profile lawsuits have claimed the government unjustly added people to the list and blocked their efforts to have their names removed. Last summer, a federal court ruled in favor of 13 people who claimed the government violated their constitutional rights to travel by placing them on the no-fly list. The government was ordered to tell the plaintiffs whether they're on the list, spell out the reasons they are barred from travel, and to give them a chance to challenge the government finding.\\n\\nThe case was one of the biggest challenges yet to the super-secret government list, but the veil that shrouds the no-fly list still remains.\\n\\nThere is this black box procedure which operates purely behind the curtains and no one is able to part those curtains and find out what really goes on, airline industry analyst Robert Mann explained to Yahoo Travel.\\n\\nThe government maintains that the secrecy about the no-fly list is necessary for national security. A potential terrorist can be tipped off that the government is watching him, the logic goes, if he gets a letter saying he's now on a government blacklist.\\n\\nI think it's like any high security process, says Mann. You don't want to reveal sources and methods because knowledge of those sources and methods permit nefarious individuals to compromise them.\\n\\nDespite the secrecy, various court cases, news reports and leaked documents have shed some light on the process behind the no-fly list. Here are eight possible ways one can end up on it.\\n\\n1. Being suspected of direct terrorist activity\\n\\nThis one may be obvious, but of course known terrorists end up on the no-fly list. The man who tried to bomb a Northwest Airlines flight in 2009 and the man convicted of planting a car bomb in Times Square in 2010 both were on the no-fly list (they were able to board planes anyway). Last year, the Intercept obtained a secret document issued by the National Counterterrorism Center that details how the government puts people on the no-fly list as well as on terrorist databases. It lists people convicted of or arrested for acts of terrorism, bombers, hostage takers, assassins, associates of terror groups, and others. According to the document, federal agencies can nominate someone for a government blacklist if an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\\n\\nAccording to The Guardian, the Justice Department has also said that authorities must have a reasonable suspicion that someone poses a threat before they put them on a watch list. However, civil liberties activists have argued that reasonable suspicion is extremely subjective.\\n\\n2. Travel to certain countries\\n\\nFrequent trips to a known trouble spot can raise a red flag. If you travel to certain places, the likelihood is you get more scrutiny, says Mann. If you travel frequently to countries that are known to be involved in terrorism or financial crimes, you do run the risk of having your travels alerted more carefully.\\n\\n3. Something you said in the past\\n\\nThere are numerous complaints from non-violent political activists who say they ended up on a no-fly list for something they said. Former Princeton University professor Walter Murphy told The Guardian that in 2007, he was denied a boarding pass in Newark International Airport. He suspects it was because of a high-profile lecture he gave that had been critical of then-President Bush. In 2012, Wade Hicks, the spouse of a Navy lieutenant, claimed he was told he was on a no-fly list. He thinks it was because of comments he made about 9/11.\\n\\n4. Have a similar name to someone on the no-fly list\\n\\nThis is a common complaint from those who claim they are on the no-fly list unjustly. If you have a name which is similar in sound or spelling or in phonetical interpretation to someone who probably legitimately should be on the list, you're at risk for finding yourself on the list, says Mann. He cites a friend of his who shares a last name with an Irish Republican Army operative who was active in the 1960s and 1970s. That unfortunate coincidence, says Mann, landed not only his friend on the list but also the man's son — who wasn't even born during this operative's heyday.\\n\\nIn 2007, 60 Minutes famously brought together a group of people named Robert Johnson who experienced problems flying, likely because a man also named Robert Johnson had been convicted of plotting to bomb a Hindu temple and a movie theatre in Toronto.\\n\\n5. Not becoming an informant\\n\\nAccording to a federal lawsuit heard in New York this summer, four Muslims say they were put on the no-fly because they refused to spy for the FBI. The men's names were removed from the list but they sued FBI agents for damages.\\n\\n6. Clerical error\\n\\nAccording to a lawsuit detailed in Wired magazine, a Stanford University doctoral student was placed on the no-fly list in 2004. After seven years of federal lawsuits, it was determined she was unjustly put on the list because an FBI agent had checked the wrong box on a form.\\n\\n7. Law enforcement issues\\n\\nMann says you may not even have to be suspected of terrorism to get on a no-fly list. In some cases, people have either open warrants or some other characteristic indicating criminal activity and then they find themselves on this list, he says, even when the alleged activity has nothing to do with aviation security. Mann believes that's a sign the no-fly list has morphed beyond an air security tool into an all-out law enforcement tactic. This has mission-creeped into something that is much wider in scope than was originally intended, he says.\\n\\n8. Controversial Tweets\\n\\nThe government guidelines published by the Intercept barred agencies from blacklisting people based on information that is unreliable or not credible. But it does point out that social media posts should not automatically be discounted when deciding whether someone belongs on a blacklist. Agencies are instructed to evaluate the credibility of the source, as well as the nature and specificity of the information, and nominate even if that source is uncorroborated.\\n\\nBut don't worry: chances are your tweet will not land you on a no-fly list. Writing the TSA on Twitter with some negative comments about your experience at such-and-such airport won't do anything other than get you a 'sorry' from the TSA, says Mann. There's so many of those, half the traveling public would be on the darned list.\\n\\nThe government, either via policy change or court order, has made some changes to the no-fly list that have opened up the process somewhat. But everyone agrees, it's still a slow and secretive process.\\n\\nMore from Yahoo!

{"original": "In a reversal of a years-long decline in support for the U.S.-Cuba trade embargo among South Florida Cuban-Americans, a new poll shows more now agree with the restrictive policy that was eased by the Obama administration, but remains in place.\\n\\nThe poll, conducted by Florida International University, was evenly split between the 45 percent who said the U.S. should keep the embargo, the 44 who want it to end, and the 11 percent who said they were unsure.\\n\\nThat's almost a 10-point change from the poll that roughly two years ago found 54 percent wanted the U.S. to end the embargo - and showed more optimism about the prospect of improved U.S.-Cuba relations.\\n\\nAn overwhelming 80 percent of the 1,001 Cuban-American respondents viewed the embargo as a failure, which has not wrung enough democratic reforms from the Cuban government. But the change in the amount who support the embargo seemed to reflect a frustration with the lack of progress in Cuba since the sanctions were eased in recent years.\\n\\nPresident Barack Obama announced a restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014, and loosened travel and trade restrictions. In 2016, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge, in 1928.\\n\\nYounger Cuban-Americans, including those from the second and third generations, expressed the most opposition to the embargo. Cuban Americans who came to the U.S. after 1995 also viewed the embargo more negatively than others.\\n\\nBut it was among older Cuban-Americans that support for the embargo jumped more than 10 points – from 57 to 68 percent - in the latest poll. And more than half of Cuban-Americans who are registered voters agree with maintaining the embargo.\\n\\nAt the same time, 63 percent said they supported Obama's decision to open diplomatic relations with Cuba.\\n\\nThe mood of the community has changed in the last two years,'' said Guillermo Grenier, the principal investigator on the project, and chairman of the Department of Global and Sociocultural Studies in the Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs, the primary sponsor of the poll. We see a community divided on the issue of the embargo, while still willing to maintain and even expand business relationships established as a result of the Obama initiatives.\\n\\nCuban-Americans continue to welcome and support many of the changes in U.S. policy since December 2014, such as travel, the maintenance or expansion of limited economic relations and the willingness to allow U.S. citizens to invest in Cuban businesses, the poll authors wrote. Yet, there is a retrenchment of old, less conciliatory positions by the old, less conciliatory segments of the community.\\n\\nThe embargo long has been described as symbolic by both its supporters and critics, who view it as a solitary move in a world that keeps diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba.\\n\\nThe new poll results explain why many Cuban Americans support the embargo, even as they concede it has not pushed real change in Cuba.\\n\\nDulce Canal, spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Cuban Observers of Human Rights, told Fox News: The survey results reflect the rejection of the Cuban regime and its policies and practices. There is a collective weariness that has festered over time after so much frustration and oppression. The reaction among these Cuban Americans is a natural one toward the Cuban regime's intolerance and inflexibility.\\n\\nCuba each year urges the U.N. General Assembly to pass a resolution critical of the embargo, a text that normally obtains majority backing. According to Cuba, the U.S. embargo has cost the island more than $800 billion since it was was implemented in 1962.\\n\\nSucceeding U.S. presidential administrations and many members of Congress have said the embargo will not be lifted until Cuba moves toward more democratic reforms, like legitimate elections and freedom of expression. During his presidential campaign, and as president, Donald Trump said Obama's decision to ease trade and travel restrictions essentially played into the hands of a regime that had made virtually no concessions in return.\\n\\nCuban government officials typically deny the existence of political prisoners, saying instead that counter-revolutionary activities, or trying to incite others against the regime, is a crime.\\n\\nObama earned praise by moving forward with normalizing relations, particularly among those who said it was time to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations. But others said Obama gave away too much, and got back little or nothing in return. And not only did Obama's actions not benefit the U.S., the critics said, they did nothing to help the Cuban people.\\n\\nThe survey results reflect the rejection of the Cuban regime and its policies and practices. There is a collective weariness that has festered over time after so much frustration and oppression — Dulce Canal, spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Cuban Observers of Human Rights\\n\\nCuba's new president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, who took over last year from Raul Castro, who in turn succeeded his brother Fidel 2008, was the hand-picked successor of Cuba's leadership. And while some significant changes did take place under Raul Castro, including more access to the Internet by critics of the government, and the chance for Cubans to run their own businesses.\\n\\nTravel outside the island became less restrictive, and some of the government's most vocal critics, including Guillermo Farinas and Yoani Sanchez, were allowed to travel abroad – where they firmly assailed the island's political leaders in speeches and media interviews -- and return to Cuba. Many of those moves did not occur under Fidel Castro's leadership.\\n\\nBut much has not changed. Political opposition is discouraged and often punished, with threats of job loss and imprisonment. Dissidents still report incidents of beatings and arrests for participating in peaceful marches or expressing opposition.\\n\\nIf the polling is an accurate portrait, likely an 'exasperation factor' contributed to the increase in those supporting the 'embargo,' said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, Inc., in New York. From December, 2014 through November, 2016, there was an expectation, perhaps more of a rational hope, that the Obama administration changes to the bilateral commercial, economic and political relationship with the Republic of Cuba would continue through [a Hillary] Clinton administration. That was faulty thinking because of the outcome of the election.\\n\\nThere was also an expectation, and, again, rational hope, that changes taking place in the Republic of Cuba would continue but, more importantly, would increase in velocity, Kavulich said to Fox News. The transition from the Castro administration to the Diaz-Canel administration would bring a new dynamic.\\n\\nBut the result has been a continuing struggle by the government of the Republic of Cuba in determining the definition of success and the level of success permitted for a citizen, he said. Finally, there has been a disappointment by individuals of Cuban descent who reside in Florida with the abject lack of Obama Administration initiatives permitted to be implemented by the government of the Republic of Cuba.\\n\\n?"}

{"original": "Shortly after he took office on Monday, California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unearthed an unprecedented new health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering dramatically more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting the embattled Affordable Care Act, which a federal judge recently struck down as unconstitutional.\\n\\nThe sweeping proposal appeared destined to push California -- already one of the nation's most liberal states -- even further to the left, as progressive Democrats there won a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature in November and control all statewide offices.\\n\\nPeople's lives, freedom, security, the water we drink, the air we breathe — they all hang in the balance, Newsom, 51, told supporters Monday in a tent outside the state Capitol building, as he discussed his plans to address issues from homelessness to criminal justice and the environment.

The future depends on us, and we will seize this moment.\\n\\nNewsom unveiled his new health-care plan hours after a protester interrupted his swearing-in ceremony to protest the murder of police Cpl. Ronil Singh shortly after Christmas Day. The suspect in Singh's killing is an illegal immigrant with several prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that so-called sanctuary state policies, like the ones Newsom has championed, contributed to the murder by prohibiting state police from cooperating with federal immigration officials.\\n\\nAs one of his first orders of business, Newsom -- who also on Monday requested that the Trump administration cooperate in the state's efforts to convert to a single-payer system, even as he bashed the White House as corrupt and immoral -- declared his intent to reinstate the ObamaCare individual mandate at the state level.\\n\\nANALYSIS: AS CALIFORNIA'S PROGRESSIVE POLICIES GET CRAZIER, WHAT'S THE SILVER LINING FOR THE GOP?\\n\\nThe mandate forces individuals to purchase health care coverage or pay a fee that the Supreme Court described in 2012 as a tax, rather than a penalty that would have run afoul of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Last month, though, a federal judge in Texas ruled the individual mandate no longer was a constitutional exercise of Congress' taxing power because Republicans had passed legislation eliminating the tax entirely -- a move, the judge said, that rendered the entire health-care law unworkable.\\n\\nAs that ruling works its way to what analysts say will be an inevitable Supreme Court showdown, Newsom said he would reimpose it in order to subsidize state health care.\\n\\nMedi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, according to Newsom's new agenda. The previous age cutoff was 19, as The Sacramento Bee reported.\\n\\nAdditionally, Newsom announced he would sign an executive order dramatically expanding the state's Department of Health Care Services authority to negotiate drug prices, in the hopes of lowering prescription drug costs.\\n\\nIn his inaugural remarks, Newsom hinted that he intended to abandon the relative fiscal restraint that marked the most recent tenure of his predecessor, Jerry Brown, from 2011 to 2019. Brown sometimes rebuked progressive efforts to spend big on various social programs.\\n\\nFor eight years, California has built a foundation of rock, Newsom said. Our job now is not to rest on that foundation. It is to build our house upon it.\\n\\nNewsom added that California will not have one house for the rich and one for the poor, or one for the native-born and one for the rest.\\n\\nThe country is watching us, the world is watching us. — California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\\n\\nIn a statement, the California Immigrant Policy Center backed Newsom's agenda.\\n\\nMaking sure healthcare is affordable and accessible for every Californian, including undocumented community members whom the federal government has unjustly shut out of care, is essential to reaching that vision for our future, the organization said. Today's announcement is an historic step on the road toward health justice for all.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe Sacramento Bee reported on several of Newsom's recent hires, which seemingly signaled he's serious about his push to bring universal health care to California. Chief of Staff Ann O'Leary worked in former President Bill Clinton's administration on the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which offers affordable health care to children in families who exceed the financial threshold to qualify for Medicaid, but who are too poor to buy private insurance.\\n\\nAnd, Cabinet Secretary Ana Matosantos, who worked in the administrations of Brown and former GOP Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, has worked extensively to implement ObamaCare in California and also worked with the legislature to expand health-care coverage for low-income Californians.\\n\\nFox News' Andrew O'Reilly and Corbett Riner contributed to this report."}
{"original": "President-elect Joe Biden released a crucial element of his new coronavirus vaccine plan Friday, as his office announced he doesn't intend to hold back doses of the authorized vaccines to ensure that people already vaccinated have a waiting dose for a second shot.\\n\\nThis is a reversal of what the Trump administration has been doing.\\n\\nThe president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, said Biden spokesman T.J. Ducklo. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now.\\n\\nDR. MARC SIEGEL: COVID VACCINATIONS WILL INCREASE RAPIDLY — GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT IN VACCINE HISTORY\\n\\nBiden's strategy apparently assumes drug manufacturers will be able to produce enough vaccines to enable people to get their second dose in a timely manner, and he pledges to invoke the Defense Production Act to make sure that enough vaccines and supplies are made available.\\n\\nOn the surface this plan would appear to contradict Food and Drug Administration policy. This policy authorizing the emergency use of vaccines produced by drug companies Pfizer and Moderna was based on clinical trials that showed the vaccines were safe and about 95% effective for people receiving two shots at set intervals\\n\\n.It is impossible to ascertain with certainty exactly what one shot alone would mean in terms of persistent immunity, since this has only been studied in conjunction with a second shot.\\n\\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn spoke with me about this on SiriusXM's Doctor Radio this week and stated that he believes the second shot must be given at the predetermined studied interval under the terms of the emergency use authorization for the two vaccines.\\n\\nThis is not necessarily the same thing as saying the second vaccine doses should remain in federal deep freeze. In fact, I have no problem whatsoever with the Biden plan providing that the recipients adhere to the terms of the FDA's conditional approval. In other words, increase the vaccine supply, but ensure proper administration based on current science and federal law.\\n\\nThe part that needs to change is the strict adherence to the pecking order. This is meant as guidance only, but is being too strictly enforced.\\n\\nThis is the main reason that with over 22 million vaccine doses distributed as of Friday night, only 7 million shots have been administered.\\n\\nStories abound of vaccines being discarded when they haven't been used in time after being unfrozen.\\n\\nIt is tragic that regulations are getting in the way of immunizations, especially when there are plenty of custodial workers, food preparers, elderly patients and other high-risk individuals who would line up to take vaccines that suddenly became available.\\n\\nEvery hospital, clinic, pharmacy and vaccine center that is administering the COVID-19 vaccines needs a B list of people who are eager to get a shot. At the same time, we need more vaccine centers, staffed around the clock, and more flexibility — not more red tape.\\n\\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has announced an informal rule for his state that he has named after his mother, called Matilda's Rule.\\n\\nAs of Monday, everyone listed as 1-B for vaccine priority — people over age 75; those at high risk of COVID-19 complications; and essential workers including police, firefighters, postal workers and teachers — will be eligible a the vaccination.\\n\\nBut at the same time, the governor said Friday that it could take up to 14 weeks (mid-April) before this group is fully vaccinated. His mother, he indicated, would be no exception.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nI received dozens of calls and emails from my elderly patients Friday asking for a vaccine, but I have had to tell each and every one of them that a reservation is a promise — not an appointment.\\n\\nEven though there are plans to build a vaccine center in the Javits Center in New York City and to expand capabilities all around the state, it will be a long time before the supply is there to meet the full demand.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Cuomo's excess regulations and prioritizations and threatened fines clearly slow the wheels of progress towards widespread vaccinations that will lead to herd immunity. Cuomo announced Monday that hospitals in his state could be fined $100,000 if they did not administer all their vaccine doses this week, and could be denied further doses.\\n\\nAs I wrote in my book, COVID: The Politics of Fear and the Power of Science, the last thing we need is for political posturing and blame to impede the vaccine rollout.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTo realize how fumbled the current vaccine rollout is, we can look to back to 1947, when a single case of smallpox in New York City led to a mass vaccination program of 6 million people in less than a month, using glass syringes as opposed to modern techniques.\\n\\nIt is disturbing to consider that even as vaccine science itself advances so dramatically, the deployment of our new best weapon against the burgeoning pandemic might be better accomplished using a simpler more old-fashioned historical model.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DR.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, Joining me straight ahead right here on Sunday Morning Futures, let the oral arguments begin. Coming up this morning, an exclusive interview with Senator Ted Cruz ahead of the Senate impeachment trial beginning this Tuesday. Also, one of the newest members of President Trump's legal team, former federal prosecutor Robert Ray, is here to discuss the president's case. Then, Donald Trump Jr. here on the trial, the attempts to take down his father and the election year ahead. Plus, breaking news this morning into John Durham's criminal investigation into the FBI with Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee. Joining me ahead to look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. So, the week has arrived. The Senate trial will begin this Tuesday. How long will this impeachment trial last? Here is Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham on this program two weeks ago.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Well, I hope to have the trial over by the end of January. We would use the Clinton model, where you take the record established in the House, let the House managers appointed by Pelosi make the argument. Let the president make his arguments of why the two articles are flawed. And then we will decide whether or not we want witnesses. But this should be done in a couple weeks.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Joining me right now, in an exclusive interview, is Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. Senator, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for being here.\\n\\nSEN. TED CRUZ (R), TEXAS: Thank you, Maria. Good morning.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So, this is the first time we will hear from the president. Of course, the president and the White House coming out with a statement last night ahead of the trial. Would you agree that this could be as shore as two weeks? What is your expectation?\\n\\nCRUZ: I think it is certainly possible that this trial could last one to two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it six, eight weeks, or even longer. So I think there are really two paths here. But what you just noted there is important. This week is going to be the first time in a year that the president has had the opportunity to defend himself, to lay out the facts, to lay out the law, to lay out the actual substance. We have seen months and months and months of a one-sided show trial from House Democrats, where they didn't want to hear from the defense, where they shut out the White House, where they shut out the minority. The good news is, in the Senate, what I'm confident of is, we're going to have a fair trial. We're not going to give in to the kind of games that House Democrats have played. Instead, we're going to give both sides a full and fair opportunity to present their case. The House managers will have every opportunity to stand up and to present their arguments, to put forth whatever evidence they have. But for the first time, the president and the White House defense team is going to be able to walk through the facts and substance. And I think that's a very, very important development.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Let's talk about your reciprocity resolution. So if you were to go down the road of witnesses, you want it to be reciprocal. Tell us about that.\\n\\nCRUZ: Well, that's right. It's kind of strange how we got here. So Democrats have been having hearings, have been doing impeachment for months in the House. They brought in all sorts of witnesses. They blocked the minority from having any witnesses. And then, as soon as we get to the Senate, the Democratic talking point is, we want more witnesses. Never mind all the witnesses they called before. They want yet more. And they're trying to delay this. They're trying to drag this out. They want this trial to go on forever, because they have a political objective of attacking the president. What I have said and what I have urged the conference is, is, listen, if we go down the road of witnesses, we're not going to do what the House did. We're not going to have a one-sided kangaroo court. Instead, we're going to respect reciprocity. What does that mean? That means, if the prosecution gets a witness, the defense gets a witness. If the prosecution gets two, the defense gets two. That means, if the prosecution gets to call John Bolton, then the president gets to call Hunter Biden. And I got to tell you, the Democrats are terrified about seeing a witness like Hunter Biden testify, because they don't want to hear evidence of actual corruption, of corruption, potentially, of Joe Biden, corruption that occurred during the Obama administration. They blocked all those witnesses in the House. They're not going to succeed in blocking them in the Senate. If they want to go down the road of witnesses, that means the president enjoys the rights to due process, which means he can call witnesses and lay out his defense.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: What would that open up a whole 'nother can of worms? I mean, obviously, this whole focus on the president and this impeachment trial has put Hunter Biden and Joe Biden to the backseat. No one is actually talking about what went wrong there and why he accepted this money from foreign countries, leadership of foreign countries, while his father was sitting vice president.\\n\\nCRUZ: Well, Maria, you're right. And the Democrats desperately want to keep that topic off the news. And, sadly, an awful lot of folks in the media are very compliant with that. But that's why I said this week the president having the opportunity to defend himself is so important, because I think one of the fundamental defenses that I expect to hear from the White House this week is that the president has inherent authority and, in fact, a responsibility to investigate corruption. And when you look at what happened with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, there is, at a minimum, prima facie evidence of corruption. You have got Hunter Biden getting paid $83,000 a month by Burisma, the largest natural gas company in Ukraine; $83,000 a month is a million dollars a year.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Wow.\\n\\nCRUZ: Hunter Biden had zero experience in oil and gas. It's not like he was a geologist or geophysicist. He was getting that money, the obvious inference is, because his daddy was vice president. And Joe Biden is on video at the Council of Foreign Relations bragging that he blocked a billion dollars in foreign loans and foreign aid to Ukraine until they fired the prosecutor who was potentially investigating Burisma, the company on which Hunter Biden sat on the board. When -- if the Biden family is profiting to the tunes of millions of dollars, the president is entirely justified to say, let's investigate and find out what happened. That's why Hunter Biden is such an important witness and why the Democrats don't want to focus on, what was the evidence of actual corruption? I expect to hear a lot from that -- from the White House defense team this week.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: You have got a 51-vote threshold in terms of getting that vote to hear witnesses. Do you want to hear from witnesses? Then I want to get your take on the White House's letter sent last night, basically calling the articles of impeachment violations of the Constitution.\\n\\nCRUZ: Well, starting with the second part first, I do think what we have seen coming out of the House is an abuse of the Constitution. And the reason is that they're using this for political purposes. This is the first time in history any president is alleged -- has been impeached without the articles alleging any criminal conduct at all, without alleging any federal crime was violated. They don't allege any federal law was violated. They don't even allege as much as that the president has a speeding ticket, and that has never happened in our country's history. And to use impeachment, like the House Democrats are doing, to express their political disagreement with the president, to try to overturn an election they're unhappy with, that is an abuse of the Constitution. Now, the first question you asked about process and witnesses, let me tell you what we can -- what we can expect to see in the next week or two going forward. On Tuesday, when we come back, the Senate will convene at 1:00 p.m. And we will start with pretrial motions. We will start with probably battling motions. What I expect the Senate to do is adopt a scheduling order laying out the next couple of weeks. That scheduling order is modeled after the scheduling order for the Bill Clinton impeachment. It's very, very similar. So it provides that we start with the House managers getting 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. They can argue evidence. They can argue law and argue whatever they want. After that, the president and the White House, they get 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. Then we shift questions from senators. Senators get 16 hours. Our questions have to be in writing, and the chief justice asks them for us. All of that, I would anticipate, takes about a week -- a week to a week-and-a-half. At that point, what the scheduling order provides is, the Senate is going to vote on whether or not additional witnesses are necessary. That's a 51- vote threshold. I don't know how that vote is going to come out. I think all 47 Democrats will vote yes. The open question is whether there will be four Republicans to join with those 47 Democrats. And, look, I think some of that depends on what happens in the first week- and-a-half, what arguments the House managers put forward, what arguments the White House puts forward, what questions comes out. I hope, at the end of the week-and-a-half, where Republican senators are is -- is, we have heard enough. The evidence they have put forward doesn't satisfy the constitutional standards. The Constitution says, impeachment lies for high crimes and misdemeanors.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nCRUZ: This wasn't a high crime or misdemeanor. They didn't allege any crime at all. And so I hope, at the end of this process, that we will get at least 51 votes to say, let's move to final judgment. And when we move to final judgment...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nCRUZ: ... the outcome of this is going to be, the president will be acquitted. The Senate will vote not guilty. And the reason I can say that with confidence is because, on their face, the articles of impeachment, they don't allege high crimes and misdemeanors. They fail on their face. And so I hope we get 51 votes in a week-and-a-half to say, this is over. If not, if not, if there are at least four Republicans who joined the Democrats for witnesses, then we're looking at a trial that will probably last six, eight weeks or longer...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: ... because you have to assume there's going to be litigation over the witnesses, there's going to be delay. But if we go down the road of witnesses, all of the Democrats, envisioning only prosecution witnesses and no defense witnesses, they're in a fantasyland. The Senate is not going to do like the House and play political games.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: We're going to be fair, and we're going to give the president a full opportunity to defend himself.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Real quick, how likely is it that we see a motion to dismiss in the first -- after the first 48 hours, after you actually look at those articles?\\n\\nCRUZ: You know, I don't think it is that likely.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: OK.\\n\\nCRUZ: And the reason is, I think dismissing this cases is a much less attractive option than rendering final judgment and acquitting the president.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Sure.\\n\\nCRUZ: And the reason is twofold. Number one, if you do a dismissal, a dismissal doesn't reach the merits. An acquittal, a verdict of not guilty, that verdict stands for all time. Nancy Pelosi is going out on TV crowing that the president has been impeached forever.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nCRUZ: Well, when will we get to final judgment, the president will have been acquitted forever of these bogus impeachment charges.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: That's a much better outcome for the president and for the country.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And we're going to speak with...\\n\\nCRUZ: Secondly, if we dismissed at the outset, the president would never get a chance to defend himself. The president -- the White House lawyers would never get the opportunity to put on the affirmative case.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: That's true.\\n\\nCRUZ: Think about it. In the months and months of House hearings, what I said on Hunter Biden, you didn't hear any of the witnesses say that, because the House Democrats didn't want those facts and evidence.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Sure.\\n\\nCRUZ: They didn't want to explore the evidence of corruption.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: The president is entitled to have his case laid out, laid out persuasively, to be able to point out, as the brief the president filed this weekend points out, that these House Democrats have wanted to impeach the president since November of 2016.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: That's right.\\n\\nCRUZ: Since Election Day, they have been saying, we're going to impeach the president, which means this has nothing to do with Ukraine. It was long before anything had happened with Ukraine.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nCRUZ: This was before the president had been sworn in. House Democrats were saying they wanted to impeach him. This is pure politics, and it's abusing the Constitution.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right. What a week this will be. I want to take a break. When we come back, there are some areas where you agree with your colleagues on the left. One of them is about big technology and how powerful technology companies have come. There were worries that the big tech companies cheated in the 2016 election. I want to ask you if you expect them to cheat in 2020.\\n\\nSenator Ted Cruz, stay with us. Back in a moment with more.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And I am back with Texas Senator Ted Cruz ahead of a historic week, with the impeachment trial starting. Real quick, before we get to technology, Senator, in terms of that resolution, is there any concern that you have got, the senators, basically having allegiance to Joe Biden? He's served 36 years in the Senate. There are some senators who will be -- quote, unquote -- jurors who are running for president. Of course they have a -- they have their motive. And then there are others who perhaps have an allegiance to Joe Biden.\\n\\nCRUZ: Well, look, there's no doubt Joe Biden served with an awful lot of senators. There are a number of senators who consider him a personal friend. I am hopeful and I believe that senators will do their constitutional duty, which means that they're not going to decide this case based on friendship, but, rather -- there was a reason that the framers of the Constitution gave the responsibility of conducting an impeachment trial to the Senate. They debated quite a bit where to do the impeachment, particularly of a president.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nCRUZ: And one of the options they considered was the U.S. Supreme Court. They also considered the Senate. They also considered a third option of sort of a combination of the two, combining the two.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: And that's sort of what they did by bringing the chief justice the United States in to preside over the Senate. But if you look at the Federalist Paper -- Papers...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: ... Alexander Hamilton explains, the reason they chose the Senate was two things. Number one, they wanted an institution with the credibility to resolve issues.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nCRUZ: The impeachment of the president is a big deal. They knew it would be politically contentious. They wanted an institution that could have the credibility with the American people to be fair.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: Secondly, they wanted an institution that could withstand the buffeting of politics, that wouldn't be like the House. The House is designed to respond to momentary political surges. The Senate is designed to be more stable, more consistent.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Sure.\\n\\nCRUZ: That's why the framers gave it to the Senate. And I'm hopeful that my colleagues will fulfill that responsibility.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Senator, let me switch gears and ask you about a testimony in front of your committee by Robert Epstein as it relates to Google and big tech.\\n\\nCRUZ: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Listen to this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDR. ROBERT EPSTEIN, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY: In 2020, if all these companies are supporting the same candidate, there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Fifteen million votes. Go back for us. What happened in 2016? And are you worried that big tech wants to put its finger on the scale in the upcoming 2020 election?\\n\\nCRUZ: So, I'm very worried. That testimony that you just showed is Dr. Robert Epstein, who's a very respected academic. He's a psychologist, used to be the editor of Psychology Today. And he did an empirical study on Google in 2016 and on the search results they came back -- and he was astonished by the results. He found that, based on manipulated search outcomes, biased search outcomes, that Google in 2016 shifted 2.6 million votes towards Hillary Clinton. Now, here's the interesting thing, Maria. Dr. Epstein is not a Republican. He is a liberal Democrat. He voted for Hillary Clinton. So, politically, he was happy to see more votes for Hillary. But he was horrified to see big tech have that kind of power. And he went on to testify what you just played, which is, if they do the same thing in 2020, which all indications are that they're going to, they could shift up to 15 million votes. It is terrifying that a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires that now control over $5 trillion of the American economy have no accountability and the ability to censor, to deceive and to manipulate votes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: And I think that's a threat to our democracy we need to take very seriously.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, let's not forget Michael Bloomberg, who is running for president, said that he's willing to spend...\\n\\nCRUZ: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: ... up to a billion dollars, even if he's not the nominee. He's already spent $217 million.\\n\\nCRUZ: He's already spent -- Bloomberg has already spent more than every other candidate combined. And it is kind of striking. With all the rhetoric, it's fairly interesting...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: ... that the two top spenders on the Democratic side are two gazillionaires, billionaires, who are just writing massive checks. And that often is the case when you see people with socialist rhetoric, is, they often are doing so from position of great wealth themselves. And so they're happy to redistribute other people's wealth, not so much themselves.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Wow.\\n\\nCRUZ: I think we ought to be the sort of economy where everyone has a fair opportunity, where people -- people like my dad, when he came from Cuba in '57, with nothing...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: ... washing dishes...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: ... have an opportunity to achieve the American dream.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, that's...\\n\\nCRUZ: And big government socialists, which the 2020 Democrats are advocating, it doesn't give that economic mobility. It freezes the billionaires in place.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: And it freezes everyone else in place also.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Senator...\\n\\nCRUZ: That -- that's not America.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nCRUZ: And that's not the freedom that this country was built on.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: You're going to have some week ahead. We will be watching. Senator, good to see you. Thank you so much.\\n\\nCRUZ: Thanks.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Coming up, a member of the president's defense team right here on set.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back. With opening statements in President Trump's impeachment trial set for this Tuesday, he's added several high-profile names to his defense team, including Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz, not a full-time fledged member of the team, but he will present constitutional arguments against impeachment. Former federal prosecutor Robert Ray is a new full-fledged member of the team. And he joins me right now on set. Good to see you, Robert. Thanks so much for being here.\\n\\nROBERT RAY, MEMBER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DEFENSE TEAM: Thanks. Thanks for emphasizing that. And, on a personal note, thank you very much for all the appearances going back now many, many months. I'm not sure -- if not for you, I don't know that I would have come to the president's attention.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Thank you.\\n\\nRAY: So, I very much appreciate it.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, congratulations. This is a big deal. Tell me what the president..\\n\\nRAY: Of course it is.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: What the defense is.\\n\\nRAY: Well, it's a big deal because, ultimately, in the eyes of history, we are all going to be judged about whether or not we acted in the best interests of the country. I think the president's principal defense -- and you saw it in the answer that was interposed over the weekend -- is very simple. This is an entirely partisan and, therefore, illegitimate effort by House Democrats to remove a president from office. And the remedy for that is the United States Senate, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. In order to overturn the will of the electorate in the 2016 election, and particularly given the fact that we are now in the middle of a presidential campaign for 2020, ultimately, that will can only be overturned with a bipartisan effort and overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, with a two-thirds majority, in order to remove a president and overturn the will of that electorate. It's very simple.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Do you expect any Republicans to vote for impeachment?\\n\\nRAY: I don't, no.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, let's look at the letter that the White House, your team, sent last night, because the conclusion of that letter from the White House, says: The articles of impeachment violate the Constitution. They are defective in their entirety. They are a product of invalid proceedings that flagrantly deny the president any due process. Ted Cruz just said the first 48 hours will determine a lot. What are you expecting?\\n\\nRAY: Well, I think he's right about that. But I think you have also saw from the speaker, Pelosi, about essentially celebrating the notion that the stain of impeachment exists and exists forever. And the only rejoinder to that -- and that's the rejoinder that it is my job, and together with the rest of the defense team, to place before the United States Senate for their consideration -- is the question about the rejoinder being that there will be an acquittal forever as well. And that's what we expect. That's the -- that's the task ahead during the next several weeks.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Do you think you would like to see witnesses? I mean, witnesses can go either way. I know that. But they could also open up this can of worms around Hunter Biden, which seems to have been forgotten at this point.\\n\\nRAY: Well, that's a -- that's a relevant issue to consider, obviously, because, if you get into the question, as the Democrats have alleged, that anything having to do with the Bidens was completely, in their words, a sham, obviously, your views about that are affected by whether or not you think there was merit to a Biden investigation. But before we ever get to that, I think the core issue -- and Senator Cruz alluded to this -- well-founded -- and I have said this many times -- many times on your show -- well-founded articles of impeachment both allege that crimes were committed and that those are the type of crimes that constitute abuse of the public trust. Abuse of power alone -- and history has shown this -- similar to also obstruction of Congress, those types of articles of impeachment have been tried on for size before, but they have not fared well. The core of the impeachment parameters allege that crimes have been committed, treason, bribery, and things like that, in other words, other high crimes and misdemeanors.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right. Unbelievable. Robert, thanks very much.\\n\\nRAY: Thanks very much.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Robert Ray. We will be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP JR., SON OF DONALD TRUMP: I think it's going to be a great team. I think you have people that have experience. We have seen that this has been a one-sided sham from moment number one. So, I guess a lot of it depends on what happens from this point on, right? I -- I would like to personally hear from everyone. I'd like to hear from Hunter Biden. I'd like to hear from Joe Biden, because, frankly, these are the reasons we're even having this conversation right now.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Would you rather see the Senate file a motion to dismiss right away, which is what Lindsey Graham came on this program and said he's going to do a couple of weeks ago, or do you want to hear from these people?\\n\\nTRUMP: If we're hearing from all of those witnesses, then I want to sort of hear it, because I realize, again, having watched this thing transpire over the last few years and the nonsense perpetuate itself, I definitely want to hear from the other side. If the Republicans -- and some of them, the, let's call it weaker Republicans -- I sort of like the Rand Paul model -- make them vote on it. If some of those guys don't want to hear from the witnesses that we'd want to hear from, but we will hear from the others, I want to know about it, because they don't deserve to be in office. So it really depends. We have to play the game the way the Democrats have played the game. We have to play hard, but fair. Hearing from everyone is totally fair. That's not what we have seen so far, while the Democrats have controlled the process. It's not been fair in any way, shape or form.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: We should have expected that Nancy Pelosi wanted the president out just from the State of the Union last year. She delayed it.\\n\\nTRUMP: Of course. This has been their -- impeachment started November 9, 2016, OK? That's when it's been going on. The Washington Post wrote the first -- the case for impeachment 20 minutes after the inauguration. OK? This has been an ongoing saga forever. The other thing I think Nancy's trying to do with the delay is prevent other people, like Bernie, from actually being on the campaign trail.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nTRUMP: In other words, to try to guarantee...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Once again, they're colluding against Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nTRUMP: Yes. By the way, I love that they collude against themselves in this way, because the last time they colluded to rig the Democrat primary, it worked out perfectly for us because we got Hillary, and that was a godsend.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, it is pretty unbelievable. You mentioned Hunter Biden. When your president -- and when your father became president, you and your brother Eric, running the Trump Organization...\\n\\nTRUMP: Right.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: ... you stopped doing international deals.\\n\\nTRUMP: We said we wouldn't do any new international deals going forward. And that's -- hey, a big part of why I'm so involved in politics right now is because that's what I did. I did our international deals. Unlike Hunter Biden, we were actually international businesspeople before daddy got into politics, OK? Hunter Biden magically becomes an international business the second his father's pulling the purse strings. OK? That's the difference. Now, people don't want to talk about that. They don't want to talk about that.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, he got $1.5 billion, his hedge fund, from China. He took that trip on Air Force Two.\\n\\nTRUMP: Imagine Donald Trump Jr. took one-and-a-half-dollars from China, after traveling on Air Force One with his dad to go do -- imagine I took one-and-a-half dollars.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nTRUMP: It would be outrage. Hunter Biden comes back...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And then he was making, what, $50,000 or $60,000 a month from Burisma.\\n\\nTRUMP: Eighty-three thousand dollars a month from Burisma.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Eighty-three thousand dollars a month.\\n\\nTRUMP: More from Ukraine.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Let me ask you about this Lev Parnas news. Obviously, this is a guy who's indicted. He's also releasing a trove of documents to the House Intel Committee. Your name comes up in one of these text messages exchanged between Parnas and a GOP fund-raiser. How well do you know Parnas? There are pictures of, obviously, Lev Parnas with the president.\\n\\nTRUMP: Met him at some fund-raising events. He was a donor to a super PAC, shows up at some of these things, like anything else. Like, I -- honestly, it was funny. I didn't even realize he was Ukrainian. I thought he was Israeli. The reality is, you don't know him that well. But that's the problem with how this world works, right? You take a couple pictures with somebody, if someone's a donor. They get in line. They sit at a dinner with 50 people. And that's how it works. The media then takes it, oh, they're buddies. I guarantee you, my father couldn't pick this guy out of a lineup. That doesn't mean he hasn't taken pictures with him.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Right.\\n\\nTRUMP: But when you do the average click line of my father, and it's 200 people in an evening, and you do that a couple times a week, you know, this is how the game works. But, again, the media pretends that they don't know that that's how the game works.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: ... handing over these pictures. I was reading a couple of posts and tweets of yours. And you accuse Yovanovitch of monitoring you. Tell me what happened.\\n\\nTRUMP: I saw the reports that they were -- put -- assigned people in the Ukrainian Embassy, apparently, to monitor myself, other conservative figures, Sean Hannity, Dan Bongino, numerous others. So, of course, now it's -- now she's accusing people of doing the same to her, because that's what happens. When they do it, it's sort of the -- what -- the old liberal -- the Democrat politics, accuse them of doing all the things that you're doing. So, a year later, they come back to try to accuse us of it.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, throughout 2016 and 2017, we saw this hysteria in terms of collusion. And yet they just continue to look for more things to try to attack your father.\\n\\nTRUMP: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: It's...\\n\\nTRUMP: They will double down, again, any opportunity to hurt Trump. And that's the reality. I have said it over and over. I mean, the Democrats and the media hate Trump much more than they love America, because you can't dispute the numbers. You can't dispute all-time low unemployment for every group in this country, every demographic.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nTRUMP: You can't...\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, we're at a 50-year low in unemployment. And we have got a consumer that is obviously -- the sentiment and spending is very strong. Economic growth has moved.\\n\\nTRUMP: Correct.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: You're talking about close to 3 percent expectations in 2020.\\n\\nTRUMP: But it's not by magic. It's because he's implemented policies that have allowed the markets to work, that have allowed small business to thrive, that have allowed people to actually invest in themselves. And that's lifted everyone. That affects a lot of people.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, you make a good point, because it looks like income inequality is narrowing. When you look at the bottom earners, their wages have gone up 4.5 percent.\\n\\nTRUMP: Correct. And, I mean, isn't that the statistic that we want? Isn't that the way we want to lift, that rising tide that lifts all ships? Like, that's what we want to do. And that's what he said he was going to do. And he's done it.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So let's go to 2020 and the election. Who do you think is going to be the nominee?\\n\\nTRUMP: I think you could see the media has got it in for -- to sort of doing the full press to make sure that Biden is the guy, which is great, in a way, because, I mean, I'd sort of like to see Trump go one-on-one with Biden. When I see Joe Biden talking to a group of 20 people with a teleprompter, because they're afraid of what he may say otherwise, that tells me all I need to know. And in a large and stacked Democrat field, I think it's fine. You can probably hide some of that. Get him on the trail for five, six months one- on-one with Donald Trump, it's going to be awesome.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: What about the Bloomberg factor?\\n\\nTRUMP: Honestly, he's going to spend money one way or the other. I mean, he doesn't have the personality for this. He doesn't -- he can't relate to people. He probably inherently dislikes people. So he just doesn't have the retail side of it, which is a big part of it. You can't -- he doesn't have a stage presence. He doesn't have that personality. So he will spend a lot of money, but what's he going to spend it against? And that's the reality.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Well, he also gave the Democrats $100 million-plus at the end of the year last year, and they -- in fact, that was effective. He...\\n\\nTRUMP: I think it was for the House.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: They won the majority in the House.\\n\\nTRUMP: I don't think it helps him, because, again, he doesn't have what it takes to be a politician.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the president and how he's doing here, in the face of all of these attacks, and getting ready for impeachment.\\n\\nTRUMP: Listen, honestly, he's doing fine. You can see that through his actions. He's used to taking these punches. He's used to getting hit. And guess what? He's just going to keep working. He's actually more of a game time player than anything. So when the pressure is on, he gets things done. And what you're seeing is unprecedented success.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Don, it's great to have you on the show.\\n\\nTRUMP: Great to be back.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Thank you so much.\\n\\nTRUMP: Thank you.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Donald Trump Jr. We will be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning. President Trump's Senate impeachment trial begins this Tuesday. What should we expect? Bringing in right now Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan. He's the ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee. And, Congressman, so it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.\\n\\nREP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): You bet. Good to be with you.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: You have been helping the president in terms of his defense behind the scenes. What has been your role, sir?\\n\\nJORDAN: Well, we have talked with the White House counsel's team, but they got a great team. And, look, you got great lawyers, and you got all the facts and the truth on your side. So I think this is going to go well for the president, because, again, when you got the facts, when you got the truth, you just go make the arguments. And they got a great group of folks they have put together who are going to do just that over the next couple weeks.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And you have made four points in terms of going back to the basic facts here. And this has to do, obviously, with the transcript, which the president released right after the -- right after this began.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes. No, I mean, look, they never expected him to do this. One of the great moves the president made is actually release the call transcript. The transcript itself shows no quid pro quo. The two individuals on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, have repeatedly said there was no pressure, no pushing, no linkage of any type of investigation to the security assistance dollars. Third point, there Ukrainians didn't even know at the time of the call that the aid was on hold, that the aid have been paused. They didn't learn until about a month later from the Politico article. And the most important fact -- and this is one that the Democrats can never get past -- the most important fact is, the Ukrainians took no action, i.e., no announcement, no promise to start, no investigation, no announcement whatsoever about doing an investigation into the Bidens or Burisma to get the aid released. The aid was released because, over that pause time, that 55 days when the aid was paused, the president became convinced that Zelensky was a genuine reformer, and he decided to go ahead and release the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: I want to switch gears ,ask you about what's taking place at the FBI investigation. Obviously, you have done an incredible amount of work in terms of exposing the wrongdoing in 2016 and possibly early 2015, actually. We know now that General Michael Flynn is going to be reversing his plea.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Sidney Powell, his lawyer, says documents show prosecutors knew they pressed him to lie. Take a listen to this sound bite of Jim Comey on another network talking about the way he decided to send a few FBI agents over to the White House to question General Michael Flynn.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: I thought, it's early enough. Let's just send a couple guys over. We placed a call to Flynn, said, hey, we're sending a couple guys over. Hope you will talk to them. He said sure. Nobody else was there. They interviewed him in a conference room at the White House Situation Room, and he lied to them.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Sidney Powell says that this is strong inference that the prosecutors themselves conspired to cause Mr. Flynn to make false statements, basically encouraging him not to have a lawyer present. Don't - - we're just going to send a few guys over, as if it's a casual meeting.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes. And one of them even -- one of the FBI agents even said they didn't think he was lying at the time. But they later then said that he -- that he did. Yes, they tried to set him up. They did set him up. But this is not unusual, because -- well, it should be unusual, but the FBI did it another time as well. They did it on January 6 at Trump Tower, when it was president-elect Trump. They went up there and briefed president-elect Trump on the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false. They went and briefed the president on it, so they could go then leak it to the press, and the press could write about it. And they tried to set up the president-elect of the United States in the same manner. So this is how they operate. And they got caught. Think about what Mr. Horowitz told us last month, Maria. He told us that the FBI, when they went to get the Carter Page warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they lied to the court 17 times in the initial application and the three renewals; 17 times, they lied to the court. And now what's interesting, is Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two individuals who were in charge of that investigation, got in a little spat now with Rod Rosenstein, who was also involved. I find that kind of interesting, that the people who were running this all are now fighting amongst themselves.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes, they got caught, but will they actually face accountability, Congressman? You mentioned Rod Rosenstein. And now the story going viral this weekend is that Rosenstein said that he authorized the release of the Page-Strzok texts.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And some of them are just extraordinary. We have got some of those texts here on screen to show our audience, but, of course, our audience knows that there was an insurance policy and saying that she was going to be the next president, so be careful, the tone that you take with her. One more thing. She might be our next president, wrote Lisa Page.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Be careful as you go in there.\\n\\nPeter Strzok says: I saw Trump won. Figured it would be a bit. Now the pressure really starts to finish the investigation into Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes. They were out to get the president. You had on Don Trump Jr. I thought it was a great interview. He said in impeachment started on Election Day. I actually think it started even sooner. I think it started on July 31, 2016, when they opened the Trump-Russia investigation, as I said, went and spied on four American citizens associated with the Trump campaign. And who was heading that investigation? Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, who said in one of those text messages, just went to a Southern Virginia Walmart. I can smell the Trump support. The disdain they have for the president and, just as importantly, the disdain they have for folks like you and me, Maria, who support the president, who voted for the president, that is what is so wrong. And then they get caught with these text messages. And now they're going to sue? This is ridiculous. The American people -- it's great that we -- those text messages were released, because the American can people can see the bias, the animus that these folks, who ran the two biggest investigations probably of our lifetime, the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation, they can see the bias and the animus they had against President Donald Trump.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes. And it's important to bring it up in terms of what took place in '16, because here we are on the doorstep of an impeachment trial of President Trump. Meanwhile, you know that there was collusion the Democrat side, Hillary Clinton paying for the dossier. That dossier partly came from Russia and came from Ukraine.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: If that's not collusion with the Russians, what is? And then there's obstruction that they also said that the president did, and yet Hillary Clinton destroyed documents, e-mails. She used a hammer and beach -- bleach to destroy her devices.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: It's just extraordinary to me that this continues and goes unchecked.\\n\\nJORDAN: The best -- the best evidence that there was bias is, look at the names they gave the two investigations. The Clinton investigation, the code name they gave it was the Midyear Exam. But when it came to the Trump-Russia investigation, the FBI came up with Crossfire Hurricane. You can almost like see them pounding their chest like Tarzan. We're going to go get this president. We're going to go after Donald Trump. And that's exactly what they did. And never forget what Bill Barr said. Bill Barr said there was a crisis of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. That's the biggest understatement ever. Of course there was. Comey was fired. McCabe was fired, lied three times under oath. Jim Baker, chief counsel, had to resign. Lisa Page had to step down and resign as well, was kicked off the Mueller team, Peter Strzok kicked off the Mueller team and fired. So, those were the five key people who ran these investigations.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nJORDAN: I have never seen an agency where that has happened before.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: And it's absolutely extraordinary, the way Nancy Pelosi talks about the attorney general, by the way, A.G. Barr.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes. He's doing a good job.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: She talks about him as if he is not the leading legal person of the country. And she says he's just fighting for Donald Trump. I mean, it's quite extraordinary.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: So you have to bring this up, because they don't -- they want to take Donald Trump out. They don't want another word about this FBI investigation. They don't want to -- they don't want any accountability for what took place.\\n\\nJORDAN: Yes. And, remember, Bill Barr said not only that there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. He then used the word that just drove the left crazy, drove the Democrats crazy. He said there was spying took place.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\\n\\nJORDAN: There was a basis for my concern about the spying that happened. And then, third -- or, fourth, I should say, he used a term that should scare us all. He used the term political surveillance when he testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee. That's scary. And the fact that he is doing such a good job in getting to the bottom of this, that's what scares them. I look forward to the Durham report when it comes out later this year.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Congressman, it's good to you see this morning. Thanks so much.\\n\\nJORDAN: You bet. Thank you.\\n\\nBARTIROMO: Congressman Jim Jordan. Well, up next, Democrat-turned-Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew breaking news this morning on the impeachment trial and the release of inmates under prison reform. Wait until you hear that. We're looking ahead this morning on Sunday Morning Futures. We will be right back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Well, Maria was here a minute ago. This is live television, folks. Maria is under the weather. She feels sick. I'm Eric Shawn, filling in for Maria for the rest of the program. You know, there's the flu going around. She's got it. And it's a testament to the dedication, perseverance and professionalism of Maria Bartiromo that she stayed with this program until now. This is what happens sometimes in live television news. Our best to Maria. I know she will feel much better, so I will take it for the rest of the program. And we have newly minted Republican Congressman from New Jersey Jeff Van Drew. You know that he switched parties soon after the House passed those two articles of impeachment against the president. He voted no amid growing frustration at the process among more moderate Democrats in Trump districts. He joins us now with the very latest. So, Congressman, what do you expect will happen this week? You voted no, yet it is going forward. Do you think that perhaps Nancy Pelosi is going to try and subpoena witnesses after the impeachment trial is over?\\n\\nREP. JEFF VAN DREW (R-NJ): Well, first of all, let me just say I want to wish Maria best -- best wishes and that she gets better really quickly.\\n\\nSHAWN: Absolutely.\\n\\nVAN DREW: This flu has been going around everywhere. And she just doesn't deserve it. She's too good a lady.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSHAWN: Absolutely.\\n\\nVAN DREW: But I want her to know that we're all thinking about her. Secondly, to answer your question, look, the House had its time. They have spent months and months and months of reports, of investigations, millions upon millions of dollars. And we finally, the House, came up with two articles of impeachment, both of which are very weak. I will say this, and I will say it over and over again, because I think people must understand how important it is. Impeachment is a tool that is not meant to be used anywhere near a regular basis. Our founding fathers almost disliked it. It was said even by de Tocqueville, who was a famous Frenchman who loved America, that, when impeachment was used too often, that it was a sign of the degeneration of the country and the breakdown of the United States of America.\\n\\nSHAWN: Yes, democracy -- democracy in America.\\n\\nVAN DREW: We can't have political impeachments.\\n\\nSHAWN: Very quickly.\\n\\nVAN DREW: I'm sorry.\\n\\nSHAWN: We have about 30, 40 seconds left. The president's coming to your district. What's been the reaction in the Garden State since you switched? And what do you expect will happen?\\n\\nVAN DREW: It's been exciting. And I'm proud to say, proud to say, for his event, of all the events he's done in all of the country, we have had the most ticket requests. He's coming to support me and my reelection. He's coming to support about his issues. And we are really proud to have him. There are going to be thousands upon thousands. And the last I have heard, I think there's been about 100,000 ticket requests for the president. We're proud to have him. We're proud to have the president. And it shows he cares about the big towns and the big cities, and he also cares about the little places.\\n\\nSHAWN: Yes, sir. Congressman Jeff Van Drew, thank you so much. Of course, we wish Maria the very best. Send her flowers. Send Maria Bartiromo some flowers, because she's under the weather. But she will be back. Stay with us.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

{"original": "We will make mistakes in life. We try not to, but we do. The key is to be strong and secure enough to admit your mistakes and admit your shortcomings. – New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in November 2020 speaking at Riverside Church in Manhattan after releasing his book about leadership in the middle of a pandemic.\\n\\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's leadership memoir American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic was written and promoted in 2020 while over 30,000 New Yorkers died from the coronavirus (the largest number of deaths of any state) with an overwhelming percentage of those deaths coming from residents in nursing homes.\\n\\nMind you, before the American Crisis book, there was the poster the governor helped create (and sold) of a mountain representing the curve on a graph of all the cases (and deaths) in New York.\\n\\nThere were little pictures of all the things Cuomo loved about himself. His sports car, his dog, his staff members, the boyfriend of one of his daughter's depicted hanging off a cliff and a giant nose with a cotton swab inside of it. The giant nose image was perhaps a reference to a giggly interview with his news anchor brother Chris on CNN about getting a COVID test while body bags were piling up in storage trucks outside of funeral homes in the state.\\n\\nNY BUSINESS OWNERS SLAM CUOMO FOR ALLOWING BILLS FANS INTO STADIUM BUT NOT RESTAURANTS: 'TOTALLY UNFAIR'\\n\\nThe governor, it would seem, is a big fan of props. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, he introduced a wall of masks during a press conference while hospitals were complaining of PPE shortages. Then in May, his giant Q-Tip comedy routine with brother Chris began on cable news. The governor also had someone make a bizarre giant plastic COVID mountain to go with his poster demonstrating at a press conference how he had flattened the curve of coronavirus cases in New York.\\n\\nAnd then, of course, he somehow found the time to write his celebratory memoir American Crisis. We don't know how much his advance was for this book and it won't be disclosed until the spring but he received over $700,000 for his previous memoir. According to one New York website, Cuomo has pledged to donate an unspecified amount of the proceeds to a COVID-related entity.\\n\\nAmerican Crisis landed on the New York Times bestseller list in October and has lined his pockets as he continues to profit off the deaths of tens of thousands of New Yorkers.\\n\\nTwo of those deaths were my husband's parents, Mickey and Dee Newman, both of whom contracted the virus in their separate elder care facilities in New York City.\\n\\nJANICE DEAN: CORONAVIRUS COST MY IN-LAWS THEIR LIVES. GOV. CUOMO, OUR VULNERABLE LOVED ONES DESERVED BETTER\\n\\n\\n\\nI believe the deaths of thousands of seniors who have died from COVID in New York State could've been prevented, and that's the reason why I became an advocate over the last eight months trying to expose Cuomo's own mistakes and shortcomings, while the national media crown him as one of their finest politicians.\\n\\n\\n\\nHad the governor admitted his terrible decisions instead of making posters, plastic mountains and coronavirus artwork, many of us would've forgiven him. Had he written condolence cards instead of books about leadership I probably would not be speaking up on behalf of other grieving families.\\n\\nPerhaps in lieu of joking around with his brother on CNN about his love life, doing puff pieces with People magazine or submitting videotape for the Emmy Awards, the governor could have been meeting with families and expressing sorrow for their loss.\\n\\nAnd if Cuomo had admitted early on that he was caught by surprise by a once in a lifetime pandemic, we would have understood.\\n\\nBack in early March, the governor was on television dismissing the severity of the coronavirus and instead was worried about the vaping crisis in New York. He attended a vaping rally and told the public that the COVID-19 panic was bigger than the virus itself.\\n\\nSTEFANIK CALLS CUOMO 'ABSOLUTE DISGRACE' FOR PRIORITIZING DRUG ADDICTS FOR CORONAVIRUS VACCINE\\n\\nOn March 18, the governor reassured everyone there would NOT be a shelter-in-place order for New York. He told people to go about your life and do not be afraid.\\n\\nThe very next day, Cuomo began his shut down of New York. He would sign an order that helped kill thousands of seniors six days later.\\n\\nWe were all confused. And scared. But none of us knew the tragedy was yet to unfold.\\n\\nDuring that time was when Cuomo's star began to rise. Articles started coming out about America's Governor! He was single and ready to mingle, and suddenly he was the go-to pandemic politician on all the national news programs.\\n\\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, would give shoutouts to the Cuomo family and reportedly spoke to Chris Cuomo every day when he was apparently diagnosed with coronavirus and temporarily in quarantine.\\n\\nCUOMO VOWS CORONAVIRUS VACCINE FRAUD CRACKDOWN, WARNS OF $1M FINES AND REVOKED LICENSES\\n\\nCelebrity friends like Chris Rock, Rosie Perez and Robert DeNiro were helping make mask-wearing PSAs, joining the governor at press conferences and later helping raise tens of thousands of dollars for the governor's reelection campaign while small businesses went bankrupt and restaurants in New York closed their doors for good.\\n\\nThe whole Cuomo family was suddenly in our lives. The governor's daughters appeared during his daily briefings, the Cuomo brothers' comedy hour on CNN was must-see TV, and his mom Matilda was getting a law named after her, because Cuomo knew our seniors were vulnerable to the virus. He talked with great concern about our greatest generation on March 20:\\n\\nWho are we worried about? Seniors, compromised immune system, people with underlying illnesses. Where are the places we're really worried about? Nursing homes, senior congregate facilities.\\n\\nHe also said that protecting the nursing home residents was the state's top priority, calling the threat fire through dry grass.\\n\\nFive days after enacting Matilda's Law to help protect the elderly, Cuomo signed his executive order that helped execute thousands of those he said he would help keep safe.\\n\\nOn March 25, Cuomo and his health commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker issued an executive directive that required New York nursing home facilities to accept patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from hospitals. The reason was to free up hospital bed space for what was predicted to be an overwhelming number of people who would contract the virus.\\n\\nThe order stated that if a hospital determined a patient who needed nursing home care was medically stable, the home had to accept them, even if they had been treated for COVID-19. Nursing homes could not test incoming residents to see if they were newly infected or perhaps still contagious.\\n\\nNew York was the only state that barred testing of those being placed or returning to nursing homes.\\n\\nWhen I look back on our own family experience it comes down to this: The dangerous people (those who were recovering from COVID-19) were forced into nursing homes, putting others in extreme danger. And people that could make a difference in the residents' physical and emotional well-being (the family members) still, as of this date, are not being allowed into those facilities.\\n\\nWe didn't find out about the order until it was too late. Perhaps if we had known sooner we would've had a chance to react, and save them.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nWe were in quarantine, unable to visit them, hold their hands or comfort them. My in-laws never had last rites performed by a Catholic priest, they died alone. And, besides a quick graveside burial service, we never had a wake or funeral.\\n\\nI'm stating this because thousands of families went through the same tragic process.\\n\\nAnd that's when grief turned to rage. Especially since Cuomo barely got asked about the nursing home order when he did all of his mainstream media interviews on Good Morning America, CBS Sunday Morning, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, and The View. It was like the deaths of our loved ones deaths didn't matter despite the total number of lives lost being several times higher than 9/11.\\n\\nWhen the nursing home mandate was first issued, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, known as AMDA, had sent out a warning email stating that Cuomo's order admitting infected patients posed a clear and present danger to nursing home residents. Jeffrey N. Nichols, who serves on the executive committee of the group, said, the effect of that order was to contribute to the thousands of deaths.\\n\\nThose in the nursing home industry that I've talked to say they believed it to be mandatory and would've done anything to stop it from happening.\\n\\nRensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin owns and operates Van Rensselaer Manor nursing home. He says you have to question the motives behind the order because it defies logic and a basic understanding of medicine and senior care.\\n\\nThe fact that the governor and his team will not answer questions on the subject only raises more questions. The governor's administration issued the order in March, but now no one from his team seems interested in taking ownership.\\n\\nMcLaughlin defied the governor's directive in the spring and did not accept COVID-19 positive patients at their county-operated nursing home, and they required negative tests before admission.\\n\\nWe outfitted staff with N95 masks, something the state has still failed to do and did not allow our nursing home staff to work at other nursing homes to help stop the spread.\\n\\nI asked McLaughlin why he thinks the order was put in place. There have been articles written about the relationship between hospital lobbyists and their influence behind the March 25 order.\\n\\nHe answers with a question:\\n\\nWas the memo pushing COVID-19 patients a huge mistake or done to give cover to nursing homeowners who may be political allies? The families of those who lost loved ones deserve an answer.\\n\\nIt is also interesting that this document was removed from the NYS Health Department website shortly after it was reversed on May 10.\\n\\nBut for the 46 days over 6,000 COVID positive patients were accepted into those tinderboxes, resulting in viral brush fires that killed thousands. We still don't have the exact total number of those who were killed because New York is the only state that doesn't count those who caught the virus in their elder care facilities but died in the hospital.\\n\\nThe official number the governor and his health commissioner go by is around 6,500 deaths. However, estimates are much, much higher. At least 10,000 by many accounts.\\n\\nThe Associated Press put out a detailed report about the death toll coverup in August:\\n\\nNew York's coronavirus death toll in nursing homes, already among the highest in the nation, could actually be a significant undercount. But so far the administration of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo has refused to divulge the number, leading to speculation the state is manipulating the figures to make it appear it is doing better than other states and to make a tragic situation less dire.\\n\\nThe report looked at Cuomo's responses to the media when asked about the numbers, and noted that he brushes the criticism off as politically motivated and puts New York's nursing home deaths at just 20% of the state's total numbers of 30,000 while Pennsylvania is at 68%, Massachusetts is at 64% and New Jersey is at 44%.\\n\\nCuomo argued with those percentages, New York is at the bottom of the list.\\n\\nGeriatrics experts say this number doesn't make sense when other states are more than triple what the governor was spouting as facts.\\n\\nDespite being asked for these numbers by reporters, lawmakers and even the Justice Department, Cuomo and his health commissioner refuse to give them.\\n\\nBill Hammond is the senior fellow for health policy at Empire Center, an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank located in Albany. Hammond has been one of our biggest allies in trying to find out the total number of seniors that died having contracted COVID in nursing homes. He decided to use the state Freedom of Information Law Act (FOIL) to access them, but when the state Department of Health missed the statutory deadline for fulfilling his FOIL request, he appealed. When the state rejected the appeal, the Empire Center responded by suing for the information.\\n\\nHe's still waiting for the numbers.\\n\\nI asked Hammond why he thinks the governor and his health department continue to stonewall his repeated requests for transparency even trying to dodge a lawsuit.\\n\\nI can't get inside his head. It's obviously a sore subject for him politically, and maybe personally, too. Admitting to a significantly higher death toll in nursing homes will undercut his self-image as an effective leader in a crisis, confirm that he has been distorting statistics and hiding facts, and give ammunition to his bitterest political enemies. Flouting the Freedom of Information Law looks bad, but he evidently calculates that the alternative is worse.\\n\\nThe U.S. Justice Department announced in October that it is investigating whether New York is undercounting coronavirus deaths among nursing home residents, and demanded detailed data from hundreds of private facilities. But as of this report, a senior Justice Department official confirmed to me that New York state has failed to provide ANY data as of their October request.\\n\\nNot only has Cuomo and his administration failed to provide any information to the Justice Department, lawmakers, Hammond, or countless reporters and grieving families who have asked they be disclosed, he also prefers to blame others for his disastrous mandate and instead says all of it is politically motivated.\\n\\nThe list of people and things Cuomo has blamed for his error is quite lengthy. They include God, Mother Nature, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, President Trump, the New York Post, Fox News, nursing home workers, and nursing home visitors.\\n\\nAt one point, he seemingly blamed the seniors themselves: Older people, vulnerable people, are going to die from this virus. That is going to happen. Despite whatever you do.\\n\\nVivian Zayas, co-founder of Voices for Seniors, an advocacy group founded after the unexpected death of her mother while receiving a few weeks of physical therapy at a West Islip nursing home, says this situation is not about politics. For her, it's now about protecting those at risk. Zayas wrote in an email:\\n\\nWe the families are disheartened at the constant stonewalling by Governor Cuomo but we will not be deterred in our effort to seek accountability for the preventable deaths of so many seniors. We are the heroes of this story and we will continue to challenge all the players until we gain justice and reform for our vulnerable elderly population.\\n\\nOne of the questions I've never seen the governor asked is why he never used the patient overflow facilities that the federal government provided New York, including the Navy's ship Comfort, the Javits Center and other makeshift hospitals.\\n\\nMillions of taxpayer dollars went into running these operations along with doctors and staff at the ready. They instead went empty while nursing homes were packed with patients.\\n\\nMore recently here in New York, with COVID-19 numbers rising at an alarming rate, the governor's office has suggested they may use the Javits Center again in case the hospitals get overwhelmed. In the spring, nursing home residents recovering from the illness were sent back to virus ravaged elder care facilities instead of being transported to the Javits Center. The governor has never been pressed on why they were not used more efficiently to help stop the wildfire of COVID-19 from killing seniors.\\n\\nIn my months of trying to find out answers for my own family, I've been frustrated by the lack of questions Cuomo gets asked about the nursing home massacre at his daily briefings and when he was promoting his book on leadership.\\n\\nI asked Hammond about this, and his answer gave me some hope that journalism isn't dead … yet.\\n\\nCuomo does get kid-glove treatment from some in the media (especially when he does quick-hit appearances on national TV) but not from the Capitol press corps reporters who cover him on a daily basis. He and his P.R. staff are generally awful to deal with, so there is little love lost. If they don't ask about the nursing home issue more often, it's probably because they know they won't get straight answers and they have dozens of other issues to cover. They might be pushing behind the scenes, and many reporters have filed FOIL requests similar to mine.\\n\\nHammond says a lot of media outlets have done good work on the nursing home issue. One of their local TV stations in Albany, WRGB, has a countdown clock for how long it's taking Zucker to provide the numbers he promised in August.\\n\\nPro Publica, the Albany Times Union and the AP have all dug into Cuomo's record on nursing homes and highlighted his stonewalling and distortions.\\n\\nI asked Hammond about the governor and the people he surrounds himself with. I've talked with many reporters that say if they ask hard questions of Cuomo, they've gotten pushback from the administration and sometimes from their workplace.\\n\\nCuomo can be a bully, and his media staff follow that lead.\\n\\nHammond assures me that the health department will eventually have to release the true count of nursing home deaths, which is what the Freedom of Information Law clearly requires, but the delay could easily go on months longer.\\n\\nPeter and Daniel Arbeeny have been extremely vocal about their grief and calling out the governor whenever possible. In October they staged a mock funeral of Cuomo's leadership by putting over 6,000 photocopies of his book cover in a casket outside of the Brooklyn nursing home where their father contracted coronavirus and died. In an email, they both say an apology would be the first step in helping their family start to heal, but they're not holding their breath.\\n\\nRegrettably, asking a lifelong politician and the leader of NYS for an apology was met with deflection, blame and Deafening silence! WE ARE ASKED OFTEN if Cuomo ever apologized (would we accept) and our, RESPONSE IS the 'self-appointed Pandemic God' does not make mistakes, so why would he ever apologize?\\n\\nThere have been many calls for an independent, bipartisan investigation into the nursing home tragedy, especially after an internal NYS Health Department study (conducted by Cuomo's own administration) dismissed the COVID-19 recovering patients as the reason for the thousands of deaths, and instead blamed staff members and visitors. The governor's investigation of himself was panned for its complete whitewash of his failed response.\\n\\nThere were state hearings in August about the nursing home tragedy to which I was invited to testify. I was hoping my family's story would add to evidence piling up about the governor's negligence when it came to nursing homes.\\n\\nAnd then suddenly I was not allowed to appear in front of lawmakers. I was told there were emails sent from someone on the committee that was uncomfortable with my appearance and my invitation was rescinded.\\n\\nWhat was meant to be a deterrent to silence my voice instead made me even more determined to speak out, and my response is:\\n\\nIf anybody has the right to feel uncomfortable, it is the thousands of family members who lost loved ones. Many who would still be here today if they were better protected at a time when they were most vulnerable.\\n\\nThen, in late August, I was invited with my husband and his sister Donna to join many lawmakers in Albany to push legislation to create an independent commission to investigate the nursing home deaths. The passage was sponsored by Sen. Jim Tedisco, R-Glenville, and Assemblyman Ron Kim, D-Queens, in hopes of establishing a panel with subpoena power to perform a top-to-bottom review of the deaths reported in New York's elder care facilities at the height of the pandemic.\\n\\nKim lost an uncle in a nursing home to COVID-19, so for him it's deeply personal. He texted me why this is still important:\\n\\nAfter nine long months, the families who lost their loved ones in nursing homes deserve full transparency and accountability. Unless we can review an accurate number of nursing home residents, we can never fully understand how we failed to protect them. This isn't about saving the reputation or legacy of powerful politicians. This is about reassuring the public that we won't repeat the same mistakes again.\\n\\nBut Cuomo's tragic rise continues.\\n\\nThere are ongoing reports that the governor may be headed to Washington to join the Biden administration, possibly as a candidate for attorney general.\\n\\nThere are also the whispers that Cuomo has his hopes on an even higher office someday with a presidential seal. His victory tour continues while many of us watch in horror.\\n\\nIn his speech at Riverside Church just before Thanksgiving, the governor said to always remember this advice when it comes to leadership:\\n\\nDon't get defensive. Denying the mistake only assures repeating the mistake.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nCuomo is certainly good at giving out advice but fails miserably when it comes to following it.\\n\\nYour mistakes cost us the lives of our family members, governor. But rest assured, we, the People will be strong in our fight for answers and accountability. And the more you try to silence us, the louder our voices will become.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JANICE DEAN"}

One pastor told Release he was thrown off a moving train for carrying Bibles in a rucksack. His attackers yelled, These people are spoiling our religion! and threw him on to the platform.

The incoming Biden administration is better placed to deter, confront and engage Iran because of it; there is now one less thing to do, one more thing to build upon...the only one on the outside looking in is Iran, and that's as intended, and to Biden's advantage.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nPoe agrees, but also says that the Biden foreign policy team should continue the path set by the Trump administration. That policy helped secure the historic recognition of Israel by four Arab countries: the U.A.E., Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\\n\\nThe new administration should continue on the same path. The mutual recognition of Israel with several countries is a big step forward.

But this time the attack is coming from a Democrat.\\n\\nWhile Barack Obama may not share the Nixon pedigree, he and his White House are the closest thing to the Nixon regime of any that we have seen since then -- both in the extent of their paranoia and their willingness to suppress the truth and push the boundaries of law.\\n\\nIn my lifetime, in over 40 years in national politics, Mr. Obama is the only president who comes close to rivaling Richard Nixon for fundamental disingenuousness.\\n\\n[pullquote]\\n\\nHowever, some things never change, just as Woodward and Bernstein were attacked then by the establishment mainstream media for daring to question a president -- or do a story that they wouldn't touch -- they are once again attacking Woodward the way they did when he and Carl Bernstein pursued Watergate.\\n\\nAs the youngest person on Nixon's enemies list in 1972, I am particularly sensitive to a White House where they have utter disregard for trampling on dissent and on the rights of individuals.\\n\\nSince Benghazi, when I raised the alarm about a media that was not only willing to blatantly support one political party or one political a candidate but for the first time seemed willing to suppress or ignore the facts and truth as related to a disaster of American foreign policy, my fear has been that we are now on a slippery slope. Almost everything since then has helped to realize that fear. Chuck Hagel, the sequester, Mr. Obama's speeches -- all of these have revealed a mainstream press that has absolutely decided to wear its bias openly as outriders of the Obama administration. Except for one issue -- when the president refused to allow reporters to cover him and Tiger Woods playing golf together. Now that's something they can get riled up about.\\n\\nWhat this Woodward, White House sequester battle highlights is the crisis in our democracy. Not so much for what it says about Mr. Obama and his administration but for what it says about the establishment press and all the members of my own party.\\n\\nDuring Watergate, there were a number of Republicans who were willing to stand against the president of their party in defense of the United States of America.\\n\\nSadly, as as Democrat, I must confess, that today there is no Democratic Senator or member of the House who appears to be willing to publicly put the country ahead of Barack Obama's White House.\\n\\nAs important as these other issues are, however, nothing rivals Benghazi.\\n\\nDuring the Chuck Hagel confirmation fight, it was revealed that to this day, neither the public nor the Congress know the names of those who were evacuated out of Benghazi. Nor have we ever seen the transcripts of the interviews which were conducted immediately after the event.\\n\\nThe White House's excuse, that this information cannot be revealed because of an FBI investigation, is eerily and frighteningly similar to Nixon telling H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman to turn off the Watergate investigation as it threatened national security.\\n\\nSadly, it now appears that Director Mueller and the FBI are willing to serve, once again, as an instrument of cover up for an administration -- this time following a tragedy in which 4 Americans are now dead.\\n\\nAs much as I have always admired Bob Woodward and admire now him in the sequester fight and for his willingness to take on the White House, I cannot refrain from expressing my disappointment that this man, who did such a service for the country 40 years ago, has essentially taken himself off the boards of the Benghazi fiasco. I wish that if Woodward were to get in a fight, he would do it on an issue that really matters to the safety of the United States."}

Federal and state surveys and the New England Journal of Medicine report that teen marijuana use dropped a little in Colorado. Maybe there's something about legal businesses, with the dreary name dispensaries, that makes weed less sexy to kids.\\n\\nBut there is bad news: The driving death rate increased in Colorado and Washington after legalization. But the data isn't clear -- driving deaths are up even more in some neighboring states like Idaho, where weed is still banned.\\n\\nChabot says, Pot driving fatalities in Colorado are up 151 percent!\\n\\nThat's true, but that statistic is misleading because traces of marijuana stay in a person's system for a long time. Some of those people may have used marijuana weeks before.\\n\\nA more stringent measure that may indicate whether someone was actually high at the time of an accident suggests an increase of 84 percent.\\n\\nThat's terrible, but the numbers of accidents are so small -- 35 in all of Colorado in 2017, up from 19 in 2014 -- it's hard to draw conclusions. That deserves more study.\\n\\nIf anti-drug warriors like Chabot want to look seriously at the statistics, they should also include the harm done by drug prohibition itself.\\n\\nIt's nearly impossible to overdose on pot. But banning marijuana drives sales into the black market, where criminals do the selling. And criminals are more likely to settle their disagreements with guns.\\n\\nThey don't perform the reliable quality controls that legal drug sellers must do to please their customers.\\n\\nOn the black market, customers take their chances. Then, when things go wrong, anti-drug voices cry out: See? Drug markets are inherently unsafe!\\n\\nBanning drugs doesn't stop teens or adults from using them. Anyone who wants the stuff knows how to get it. One survey found that teens said it's easier to buy weed than alcohol. Alcohol is rarely sold in schools, but banning marijuana creates fat profits that inspire dealers to recruit students to sell to their peers.\\n\\nThen there are the billions of dollars spent by law enforcement -- $900 per second. (That's just the federal cost. Total spending is much higher.) And the million people arrested yearly for drug violations.\\n\\nI suggest to Chabot that drug prohibition has worked out as badly as alcohol prohibition did nearly 100 years ago.\\n\\nJust because something doesn't work doesn't mean that we end it, he replies. Doesn't mean we quit.\\n\\nI say failure sometimes does mean you should quit, because you're doing more harm than good.\\n\\nNo, because then we give up, and that's not American, Chabot says.\\n\\nWell, today, two-thirds of Americans say marijuana should be legal. One state at a time, with New York and New Jersey about to join the list, Americans are giving up on marijuana prohibition.\\n\\nGood.

It's what he does.\\n\\nNow, let's review some of the actions of the FBI director. Many of these actions were clear at the time; others we know only now. What we have learned since underscores that the president's firing of Comey was more than justified, and the actions of Comey's staff and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to trigger the most extensive investigation in history of a campaign, an administration and a president appear to be wholly without justification – and were based instead on politically inspired emotion and hysteria.\\n\\nREPUBLICAN UNCOVERED SECRET FBI DEBATE OVER TRUMP MOTIVATION FOR COMEY FIRING DURING HOUSE QUESTIONING\\n\\nJames Comey initiated his relations with Trump by holding a one-on-one meeting at which he detailed the allegations of the Steele dossier without disclosing its source. Almost immediately the contents of the dossier leaked out to press, also without the source or verification. Comey publicly confirmed there was an investigation of the administration and yet refused to confirm that the president was not a target of the investigation while he repeatedly told the president that was the case.\\n\\nWe then learned through Comey's congressional testimony that he decided to take it upon himself to clear Hillary Clinton on her email controversy, and that the memo clearing her was drafted months in advance of much of the actual investigating. Once he believed the attorney general was compromised, as he testified, he should have asked for an independent counsel. Instead he exceeded his role and authority, politicizing the FBI in the process.\\n\\nHis testimony was enough to get Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to endorse Comey's firing in writing, citing his complete lack of professionalism.\\n\\nNow, in the year since, we have learned new information that buttresses the case for his firing.\\n\\nSomehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.\\n\\nFirst, Comey's tweets and comments reveal that he despised Trump, and so the self-serving memos he was making and then leaking about his every contact with the president were likely part of an effort to build a case against Trump. We learned that the FBI was wiretapping a number of Trump campaign officials largely on the basis of the Steele dossier. We learned that the dossier was authored by an operative who hated Trump and paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign via hidden payments to their law firm. And we learned that Comey sent FBI agents to question General Michael Flynn about perfectly legal conversations they already had transcripts of, without following White House protocol, in a deliberate effort to entrap him.\\n\\nOn top of all of this, the Carter Page warrants flat-out state that the FBI had long before concluded the Trump campaign was working with the Russians.\\n\\nSomehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp – like an aide's classified mail on the laptop of a sex offender or huge payments and contributions from Russian-connected sources – was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.\\n\\nHow utterly ridiculous. I didn't support Donald Trump, and there are lots of things he does I don't support. But the idea that he was the Manchurian candidate working for the Russians when he ran on an America First platform is patently ridiculous.\\n\\nWhat this chain of actions supports is that there is a deep state — a group of unelected officials who now wield power far beyond their constitutional authority – who believe, like Comey, that they know best. In this case it was aided by Obama administration holdovers who never accepted the outcome of the election and sought to prevent it and later reverse it.\\n\\nIt's clear the same kind of retribution is going on in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) following Trump's firing of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The recent indictment of a Russian lawyer, over statements in a civil case that she did not disclose her part in securing a document from a Russian prosecutor, shows the length that these prosecutors will go to using selective prosecution as a tool for making a case against Trump.\\n\\nLike the guilty pleas to non-existent campaign violations in the Michael Cohen case, this indictment seeks to stretch the law. Never mind that this same Russian lawyer had dossier-pushing Fusion GPS as her client and dined with dossier maestro Glen Simpson the day before and after the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting. Simpson says he didn't really talk to her, so ... well, never mind.\\n\\nYes, there absolutely were some Russians trying to create confusion with the American electorate. In 1996, the Chinese poured many millions of dollars into the Bill Clinton campaign to curry favor. These governments and their would-be hangers on do try to ingratiate themselves with campaigns and take disruptive actions, just as we do.\\n\\nBut this is entirely different from believing that the president of the United States has sold out his country and that the FBI should be investigating — to the extent of even possibly wearing a wire — a White House because their boss was fired. A boss that, by the way, was then replaced by a distinguished career official, meaning no actual investigations of any kind were ever in jeopardy in any way.\\n\\nSen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said it best in an interview: Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.\\n\\nThat's right. Dumb is apparently believing you can heap scorn on the intelligence community that brought you the Iraq war and backed the idea that ISIS was not an existential threat.\\n\\nDumb appears to be believing that as president, you can change foreign policy to try to reset Russian relations that had deteriorated under your predecessor, President Obama. Or that you can fire hostile, self-serving members in the Justice Department or FBI.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe response by the FBI and DOJ to Trump's election was unprecedented, and while almost all of those behind these various actions have been exposed, fired, quit or retired, the Mueller independent counsel and SDNY investigations remain as the insurance policies set up to keep up the effort to remove the president for … something.\\n\\nAt least we are learning how this all really started, even as the answers continue to grow ever more unsettling.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARK PENN"}
{"original": "Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that a longstanding Justice Department policy protecting sitting presidents from indictment is not conclusive and represents an open discussion, in a fresh warning to President Trump amid Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\\n\\nIn an interview with NBC News' Today, Pelosi was asked repeatedly whether she believed Mueller should honor and observe Justice Department guidance that keeps sitting presidents off limits from indictment.\\n\\nI do not think that that is conclusive, no I do not, Pelosi, D-Calif., told NBC's Savannah Guthrie.\\n\\nGuthrie asked Pelosi whether it was possible Mueller, in his investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election, could recommend indicting Trump.\\n\\nLet's just see what Mueller does. Let's spend our time on getting results for the American people, Pelosi said, as she prepares to lead the Democrats upon reclaiming the House majority Thursday afternoon.\\n\\nTrump's attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said in May that Mueller has assured the president's legal team that he will follow the Justice Department guidance protecting a sitting president from indictment.\\n\\nThe policy was instated nearly two decades ago when the Clinton administration reviewed 1973 guidance that the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unduly interfere with executive branch duties.\\n\\nThe House of Representatives, as it did during the Clinton administration, can bring misconduct charges against a president through the process of impeachment.\\n\\nBut then-Assistant Attorney General Randolph D. Moss, with the Office of Legal Counsel, determined in his October 2000 memo: Our view remains that a sitting President is constitutionally immune from an indictment and criminal prosecution.\\n\\nAn October 2000 memo stated that the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\\n\\nBut Pelosi was pressed repeatedly by Guthrie over whether she believed Mueller would deviate from Justice Department policy. She left the door open to what might happen with a sitting president, while making clear that a president does not enjoy such protections after leaving office.\\n\\nThat is not the law. Everything indicates a president can be indicted after he is no longer president of the United States, Pelosi explained.\\n\\nAsked again whether a president currently in office could be indicted, Pelosi repeated: Well, a sitting president, when he is no longer president of the United States.\\n\\nOnce more, Pelosi was asked about a sitting president's protection, to which she replied: I think that that is an open discussion. I think that is an open discussion in terms of the law.\\n\\nAs for impeachment, Pelosi likewise left the door open.\\n\\nWe have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report, Pelosi said. We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason. We have to see.\\n\\nFox News' Judson Berger contributed to this report."}

{"original": "President Trump's escalating attacks on the Electoral College results are tearing the Republican Party apart.\\n\\nNow journalists love to proclaim that a political party--usually the GOP--is engaged in a civil war. But the usual cliches don't quite capture the high-grade ammunition and sky-high stakes in an election that one side says is stolen and the other says is facing an attempted coup.\\n\\nAnd some Republicans say the president's constant complaints about his loss in Georgia, which included the two Senate races, hurt morale and possibly turnout in yesterday's runoffs.\\n\\nTRUMP PUTS PRESSURE ON PENCE AHEAD OF ELECTION SHOWDOWN IN CONGRESS\\n\\nTrump, who upended the Republican establishment in winning the White House, is declaring rhetorical war on any official in his party who dares cross him over the election he insists is rigged. Loyalty to the Donald is the only criteria that matters. Otherwise he and his allies dismiss you as a RINO, someone who needs to be expelled from the ranks.\\n\\nTake Tom Cotton, one of Trump's most loyal Hill allies. The Arkansas senator, who campaigned for the president, declined to join the Ted Cruz rebellion against Congress certifying the election results today. Under the Constitution and federal law, Congress's power is limited to counting electoral votes submitted by the states, he said, and attempting to go further would establish unwise precedents.\\n\\nThis quickly earned him a presidential tweet: Republicans have pluses & minuses, but one thing is sure, THEY NEVER FORGET! The clear implication is that Cotton would be punished at the polls when he runs for reelection. Maybe the New York Times, which fired its editorial page editor for running a Cotton op-ed, would now be more receptive to a piece by the senator.\\n\\nThe notion of political retribution is hardly theoretical. Trump undoubtedly helped defeat Jeff Sessions, the first senator to endorse him in 2016, in November after his acrimonious departure as attorney general.\\n\\nWhen John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 GOP official, refused to challenge the Electoral College results, Trump called him a Republican in Name Only and tweeted that South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem should primary him in 2022.\\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES\\n\\nMitch McConnell, who has carried more water than anyone for Trump, just won reelection. But the president ripped him for having NO FIGHT after the majority leader made a speech acknowledging Joe Biden as president-elect.\\n\\nAs for Georgia, Trump has repeatedly urged Brian Kemp to resign after the Republican governor defended his state's electoral process by insisting he had followed the law. The president is vowing to campaign against Kemp, who he calls an obstructionist.\\n\\nHe ripped Brad Raffensperger as a child in the now-famous call in which he pressured and pleaded with the Republican secretary of state to find 11,780 votes to reverse his loss in Georgia. And the pressure persuaded Kelly Loeffler, one of the Senate incumbents, to send word that she will join with Cruz, Josh Hawley and at least 10 other senators in challenging the Electoral College numbers, along with more than 100 House Republicans.\\n\\nThe theme of party disunity, amplified by the leak of the Raffensperger call, echoes across the media landscape:\\n\\nWashington Post: President Trump is effectively sabotaging the Republican Party on his way out of office, obsessed with overturning his election loss and nursing pangs of betrayal from allies whom he had expected to bend the instruments of democracy to his will.\\n\\nAnd in a sign of how some of the conservative media have turned on the president, a Wall Street Journal editorial says: The leading culprit here is Mr. Trump, who as always refuses to accept responsibility for defeat. Recall that he also claimed the Iowa caucus result was stolen in 2016 when he lost to Ted Cruz. He's now spinning conspiracy theories and election falsehoods daily on Twitter . He doesn't seem to care what damage he does in promoting the myth of his victory.\\n\\nIt is this battle that will shape the future of the Republican Party over the next four years. Trump himself will push the narrative that he was robbed as he positions himself as a GOP kingmaker and teases the possibility of another run. Cruz and Hawley, who are both eyeing 2024 campaigns, have positioned themselves as all-out Trumpists. And if history judges the electoral rebellion poorly, people like Cotton and Ben Sasse can say they stood up for the Constitution.\\n\\nAt the same time, the NeverTrumper contingent must decide whether to try to reform the party or stay independent and back Biden when they agree with him.\\n\\nFor decades, Republicans cast themselves as defenders of small government, lower taxes and a muscular foreign policy. At the moment, those things seem to matter far less than pledging allegiance to Trump."}
{"original": "MIAMI -- Versailles, the iconic restaurant in the heart of Little Havana, has for decades been Miami's political hub and a must-stop for politicians trying to court Cuban-Americans votes.\\n\\nAs people sip cafecito and eat croquetas at the landmark restaurant, the buzz here these days is what Cubans say is the alarming rise of Democratic presidential frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose unabashed defense of late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has riled Cuban-Americans who view his comments as a personal attack.\\n\\nIn this critical swing state, Cubans in the Miami area — once largely Republican, but with a younger generation that leans more liberal — are used to being heavily wooed by political candidates who count on their support to win votes in South Florida. But Sanders' growing popularity – even after expressing sympathetic views of Castro and other authoritarian regimes – underscores a problem for Florida Democrats, especially in South Florida, which has a large number of Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans whose families suffered under dictators.\\n\\nFor me, it's very, very insulting and very sad that we are in a country, we left countries where we were running from or escaping from communism and the oppression of human rights violations, to come here and now be in a country where the front-runner for the Democratic nominee is a known communist sympathizer, said Maria Fernandez Gomez, a voter with Cuban roots. He has turned off all of the Cuban population in Miami and I would venture to say the Venezuelan population, Nicaraguan population, because of those comments that he has made.\\n\\nBERNIE SANDERS 'RATTLED' BY DEBATE CROWD'S PUSHBACK ON HIS PRAISE FOR CUBA, FRANK LUNTZ SAYS\\n\\nGomez said Sanders' rhetoric is not only offensive, it's personal. Her family left Cuba in the 1970s, and they came to Florida after being among the few lucky Cubans to take Freedom Flights to Spain.\\n\\nMy father was military age when he was getting ready to leave Cuba, Gomez said. They wouldn't let him out. He was an anti-revolutionary and a political prisoner so this hits close to home for me.\\n\\nThere are 1.3 million Cubans living in Florida. Estimates of how many Venezuelans live in the state range from about 60,000 to 100,000. Those numbers are critical in a purple state where just a few thousand votes could swing the election.\\n\\nThe reality is that in a state that is a 2 percent state, it's very important. Sixty thousand votes could make the difference. Cubans are clearly far and beyond the most important, said Eduardo Gamarra, a Florida International University politics professor. Among Hispanics, the big issue is that Bernie has kind of become the caricature of what the Republicans have painted.\\n\\nGamarra said if Sanders wins the nomination, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the Cuban and Venezuelan Democrats in Florida to back him.\\n\\nFor Republicans, it will be Christmas in August if Bernie gets the nomination. I think it might even mobilize people to vote against the Democrats, he said.\\n\\nIn a recent 60 Minutes interview, Sanders said: We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but it's unfair to say everything's bad. When Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a literacy program.\\n\\nVENEZUELANS BECOMING A GROWING POLITICAL AND CULTURAL FORCE IN SOUTH FLORIDA\\n\\nHe has also infamously praised the Cuban revolution as profound, saying it provided the country's people with free health care, free education, and free housing.\\n\\nThe comments certainly have not endeared him to the Cuban-American community, a once strong Republican voting bloc that has been leaning left in recent years.\\n\\nI am a Cuban Democrat. I watched the interview with Bernie Sanders. I am not a supporter of his to begin with but that put the nail in the coffin for me. There is nothing good with the Castro regime, said Raquel Robaina, a Cuban immigrant.\\n\\nBorn in 1960 in Havana, Robaina said she arrived in Miami when she was two months old. She says many Democrats — including herself — are completely turned off by how out of touch Sanders is with voters like herself.\\n\\nHe stated literacy as his example of something good, Robaina said. Literacy is education. Who cares if someone can read at a high level if all they're reading is propaganda and lies and they have no freedom of thought -- that is not education. That is indoctrination. Moderate Democrats, we do not agree at all with Bernie Sanders's line of thinking.\\n\\nVenezuelan immigrants sing the same tune, saying they fled the brutal Maduro regime with only the clothes on their back. Sanders was the only Democratic candidate to turn a blind eye to the Trump administration's recognition of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as that country's president.\\n\\nI am a business owner now. I left Venezuela in 1994 but my family is living there, and it's a perfect example, this situation happening in Venezuela, between living in democracy and living in socialism. Most of the people I know are really scared of Bernie Sanders. He will have no opportunity here in Florida, said Luis Blanco, a Venezuelan immigrant who owns a burger joint in Sweetwater.\\n\\nThose comments were echoed by Elias Attie, 20, a Venezuelan immigrant who came to Florida two years ago.\\n\\nWe don't want to pass the same thing as in Venezuela, because in Venezuela we know what happened and we don't want that to happen here in U.S., Attie said. That is the reason I left.\\n\\nBesides his rhetoric, political analysts say some of Sanders' government-run policy ideas, like his push for Medicare-for-all, has some moderate Latino voters running the other way and possibly toward Trump.\\n\\nMaria Falcon, 85, who left Cuba for Miami 40 years ago, said she's lived in a socialist country and it's not as wonderful as Sanders is portraying it to be.\\n\\nBernie Sanders likes everything free. Giving food stamps. University free … he never lived in Cuba! If you lived in Cuba, you know that it is communism, repression.

Only in America!\\n\\nI'm living proof that capitalism, American exceptionalism, Judeo Christian values, faith in God, country and work ethic and the great American Dream all work. But there is an evil plot to destroy them all.\\n\\nAmerica, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated murder of the middle class. This is no accident, mistake, or coincidence. This is a purposeful plan. This is the boldest, grandest criminal conspiracy in world history.\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough the man at the center of this massive world-class fraud is Barack Obama, there are many moving parts and co-conspirators. These include famous billionaire businessmen, corporate CEOs, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street bankers, central bankers, government employee unions, the IRS, EPA, NSA, the Bar Association, assorted communists and America-haters, and even some well-known D.C. establishment Republicans. It's quite a shocking list of conspirators.\\n\\n\\n\\nLies and fraud are at the center of this murder of the middle class. President Obama and various big government politicians need to distract the middle class from their real agenda. Lies are their WMD- weapon of mass distraction.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo they claim ObamaCare is about saving the sick and uninsured…when the real objective is income redistribution (through higher taxes and higher premiums) to make the middle class poor and dependent on government.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey claim environmental regulations and green energy will save us from global warming…when the real objective is bankrupting the middle class by tripling utility bills, gas bills and grocery bills.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey claim immigration reform is about protecting innocent children…when the real objective is to create 12 million new low-wage employees in the labor force…depress middle class wages for generations to come…and create 12 million future Democratic voters.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey claim higher taxes are to create equality… when the real objective is income redistribution and starving the biggest donors to conservative causes and candidates- small business and the middle class.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey claim higher education spending is for the kids, …when the real objective is enriching teachers unions so they can funnel hundreds of millions back to Democrat politicians.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Fed claims quantitative easing is to save the economy…when the real goals are printing enough fake money to pay for $3.7 trillion in government handout bribes to Obama's voters…and making billionaire crony capitalists like Warren Buffett far richer last year, by turning Wall Street into a fixed craps game that makes bankers and CEO's filthy rich…while our children and unborn grandchildren owe back trillions in debt. By the way Obama's buddy Warren Buffett made $12.7 billion last year. How'd you do?\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's always about lying to cover-up the real agenda of murdering the middle class; redistributing wealth; making it impossible for small business to compete with big business; rewarding lobbyists, lawyers and crony capitalists; keeping politicians in office for life; and putting big government in control of our every move.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the biggest lie of all is when politicians like Obama claim, It's all OK. Things are getting better. We're in a recovery. Look away, there's nothing to see here.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's not OK. This author was just notified by his health insurance company that my family's policy has been cancelled. Because of the lies of ObamaCare my family will have no insurance. Tens of millions of middle class Americans will soon receive the same notice. This is no mistake. This was premeditated fraud upon the middle class.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy grocery bills have skyrocketed. How about yours? My electric bills are at all-time highs. How about yours? Gas prices have doubled since Obama became president.\\n\\nHow can middle class people survive, without becoming dependent on government? Ah, that's the point. Government acts exactly like a drug dealer, hooking you on government checks for survival, just like drug dealers addict you to cocaine.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe economy is in crisis and collapse. The GDP for the first quarter was NEGATIVE 2.9%, one of the worst showings in history, six years after Obama's trillion dollar stimulus promised to save the economy. That stimulus went to Obama's voters (the poor) and Obama's donors (the super rich). But the bill (in the form of debt) goes to the middle class for decades to come.\\n\\nAnd jobs? You were told in June we created 288,000 new jobs. What the media forgot to tell you is that 525,000 full-time middle class jobs were LOST in June and 800,000 part-time crappy low wage jobs were created. Does that sound like good news to you? No, it's more murder of the middle class.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, things are not all right. Here are just a few of the facts that support, the middle class is being murdered:\\n\\n\\n\\nChina is set to pass America as the world's #1 economy based on consumer spending. THIS YEAR. It will be the first time since 1872 that America has not been the #1 economy in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the first time in history America's middle class isn't #1 in the world. Canada's middle class has passed us.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor the first time in American history more businesses are closing each day than starting up.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are now 70% more Americans collecting entitlement checks than working in the private sector (148 million takers vs. 86 million makers)… a fact provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe average full-time male employee now earns less (adjusted for inflation) than 40 years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwenty percent of U.S. families don't have a single member who is employed.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecord numbers of Americans are not in the workforce (over 92 million).\\n\\nMore On This...\\n\\nThe number of working age Americans without a job has increased by about 10 million in Obama's first 5 years as president. That means each and every year of Obama's Presidency, 2 million more Americans disappeared from the workforce.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerica's second largest employer is a temp agency.\\n\\nSeventy of Americans believe we are still in the middle of the economic crisis, or that the worst is yet to come. And, I fear they are correct.\\n\\nThere is no doubt the great American middle class is being murdered.

{"original": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was given the title of general secretary of the ruling Workers' Party formerly held by his late father and grandfather, state media reported Monday, in a move apparently aimed at bolstering his authority amid growing economic challenges.\\n\\nThe designation was North Korea's latest step taken during its first ruling party congress since 2016.\\n\\nDuring the meeting, Kim also vowed to build more sophisticated nuclear weapons, disclosed economic developmental goals and reshuffled party officials. But observers doubt whether such moves can offer North Korea any substantial solutions to difficulties that include coronavirus-related economic shocks, natural disasters and persistent U.S.-led sanctions.\\n\\nGEN. JACK KEANE ON NORTH KOREA THREATENING TO BUILD UP NUCLEAR ARSENAL\\n\\nThe congress announced Kim's new title during the sixth day of the meeting on Sunday. A congress statement said Kim has gloriously realized the historic mission to complete the country's nuclear build-up plan, according to the official Korean Central News Agency.\\n\\nKim already was the party's top leader. During a 2016 party congress, he was named party chairman and before that had led the party with the title of first secretary. But general secretary has important symbolism in the country led by dynastic rule since it was the title held by his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung.\\n\\nWhen Kim Jong Un inherited the country's leadership upon his father's death in late 2011, some foreign experts initially questioned his grip on power. But Kim, who turned 37 on Friday, has consolidated his power through high-profile executions and purges that removed potential rivals. His other top jobs include chairman of the State Affairs Commission and supreme commander of North Korea's 1.2 million-member military, along with the top party post.\\n\\nCheong Seong-Chang, a fellow at the Wilson Center's Asia Program, said Kim likely restored the old general secretary title after determining that it would further benefit his dictatorship. Under the previous title systems, Cheong said that there were too many chairmen and vice chairmen at various levels, and that authorities appeared to have thought it wasn't helpful for Kim's authority.\\n\\nDuring congress meetings last week, Kim labeled the U.S. as our foremost principal enemy and disclosed a list of high-tech nuclear weapons systems under development to cope with what he called intensifying American hostility. He said the fate of relations between Pyongyang and Washington depend on whether the U.S. abandons its hostile policy.\\n\\nNORTH KOREA THREATENS TO BUILD MORE NUKES, CITES US HOSTILITY\\n\\nKim acknowledged that a previous five-year economic development plan failed and disclosed a new economic plan that focuses on building a stronger self-supporting economy and reducing reliance on imports. He said the new plans would include more investments in the metal and chemical industries, and increasing the production of consumer goods.\\n\\nKim's latest nuclear threats were likely meant to pressure President-elect Joe Biden to resume diplomacy and make concessions after he takes office next week. But some experts say Biden, who has criticized Kim's made-for-camera summits with President Donald Trump, won't do so. They say Kim's new economic plan lacks substance, and that much of North Korea's chronic economic difficulties are a result of its decades-long mismanagement, self-imposed isolation and U.S.-led sanctions imposed because of his nuclear program.\\n\\nThere was no willingness demonstrated to take denuclearization steps for sanctions relief, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. His new economic plan doesn't look that new, as it continues the fiction of self-reliant production to advance North Korean-style socialism.\\n\\nIt's one thing to present an ambitious list of economic and military goals, but quite another to pay for and implement them, he said.\\n\\nKIM JONG UN VOWS TO IMPROVE NORTH KOREA'S TIES TO OUTSIDE WORLD AS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS PERSIST\\n\\nKim has pushed to simultaneously achieve economic growth and the expansion of his nuclear deterrent. After claiming to have achieved the ability to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons, he launched high-stakes summits with Trump in 2018 to win sanctions relief and revive the economy. But the diplomacy collapsed the following year after Trump rejected Kim's offer to get extensive sanctions relief in return for a limited denuclearization step.\\n\\nSouth Korea's military said it had obtained intelligence showing North Korea staged a military parade at a Pyongyang square on Sunday night. A statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Monday said it was checking whether it was an actual parade or a rehearsal. The parade likely featured new weapons systems in a show of force against the incoming Biden administration, observers said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, among the notable personnel changes announced Monday was the name of Kim Jong Un's influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, missing from a new lineup for the party's powerful Politburo, where she had served as an alternate member since last year. She retained her membership at the party's Central Committee, also a high-level body.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nSome observers earlier predicted she would be promoted to a full member of the bureau. It wasn't immediately clear why the 32-year-old lost her Politburo post. But given her direct lineage to the ruling Kim family, some experts caution against speculating her political clout has diminished. Last year, state media said she was in charge of relations with rival South Korea as well."}
{"original": "Just hours after House Democrats began their impeachment inquiry into President Trump, Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to anticipate the partisan storm headed his way.\\n\\nWhen you live in a polarized political environment, people tend to see everything in those terms, Roberts said in September. That's not how we at the court function and the results in our cases do not suggest otherwise.\\n\\nMCCARTHY SUGGESTS JORDAN, COLLINS AND RATCLIFFE REPRESENT TRUMP DURING SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\\n\\nNow, with a Senate trial of the president possibly set to launch next month – depending on if and when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi transmits the articles – the man at the center of the highest court, both ideologically and figuratively, is poised to preside over proceedings.\\n\\nThe unique assignment is dictated by the Constitution. With Roberts at the helm, it would mark one of the few times the highest levels of the three branches collide in a political fight – one that may last only weeks, but whose effects can ripple for decades.\\n\\nAnd given simmering tensions between Trump and Roberts, the chief justice's conduct in this role would be closely watched by both parties.\\n\\nSources say Roberts will be ready, having quietly reached out to associates in recent weeks over the role he would play in managing the trial. He may rely on the Rehnquist Model: how former Chief Justice William Rehnquist deftly handled the 1999 impeachment trial of President Clinton.\\n\\nChief Justice Rehnquist did bring a sort of solemnity to the occasion or a seriousness that tried to sort of tamp down maybe on politics and really focus on the facts of the case, said Robert Schaffer, who was a Rehnquist law clerk during that momentous court term.\\n\\nDespite voting as a member of the high court a year earlier to allow a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton to proceed -- which set the subsequent impeachment process in motion -- there was no real objection to having Rehnquist preside. The Paula Jones case led to Clinton being tried over perjury and obstruction of justice, for his later statements made under oath where he denied an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\\n\\nBut like the Clinton proceedings, the script of the Trump trial may already be set before Roberts ever gavels the spectacle to order.\\n\\nSenate leaders -- both Republicans and Democrats -- are working to finalize the trial length, testimony and exact role of the president's counsel. And it will be lawmakers -- the jury, in effect -- who would establish the exact rules of trial, not the judge.\\n\\n[Rehnquist] was content to allow the Senate to control its own procedures, said Schaffer. And really, he viewed himself as a guest of the Senate during the impeachment trial.\\n\\nBut that does not mean Roberts would be marginalized. Rehnquist issued important rulings guiding senators on impeachment procedures.\\n\\nAnd he spoke from experience, writing a 1992 history book on the 1868 impeachment of Andrew Johnson, Grand Inquests.\\n\\nThe importance of the acquittal [of President Andrew Johnson] can hardly be overstated, Rehnquist wrote, something Trump today might approve. With respect to the Chief Executive, it has meant that as to the policies he sought to pursue, he would be answerable only to the country as a whole in the quadrennial Presidential elections, and not to Congress through the process of impeachment.\\n\\nWhen it was done, Rehnquist described his role, by using a line from a favorite Gilbert and Sullivan operetta, I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well.\\n\\nRoberts Rules\\n\\nNow Roberts, who was once a law clerk to Rehnquist, gets his turn at history.\\n\\nA hybrid between a courtroom trial and a legislative debate, Senate impeachment trials mix ceremony and substance.\\n\\nThe chief justice of the United States would be sworn in first, then the senators. He would wear his judicial robes at every public session, from the seat normally reserved for the presiding officer. And he would be tasked with maintaining order with the chamber's traditional handle-less ivory gavel.\\n\\nRoberts' main role would be to make any rulings on procedure raised by senators, the House impeachment managers or the president's counsel. But while he could decide on evidentiary questions or objections, the chief could choose to have senators instead vote on those matters. Or the lawmakers could override any Roberts rulings with a majority vote.\\n\\nAnd since the senators are not allowed to speak, any questions they submit in writing would be read aloud by the judge.\\n\\nThe chief's main power may be in breaking any tie votes. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase made two such votes during the Johnson trial.\\n\\nRoberts would also be multi-tasking, conducting a trial at the same time maintaining his regular caseload. The court's counselor Jeffrey Minear would likely be by the chief's side the entire time, along with a rotating pair of law clerks.\\n\\nSEN. TED CRUZ: NANCY PELOSI HOLDING IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES FROM SENATE IS 'SIGN OF WEAKNESS'\\n\\nWhen in the Capitol, they will all likely work from the ceremonial President's Room, located just off the Senate floor.\\n\\nWe continued to do all the work of the court, said Schaffer of his experiences. So there were times when we would bring opinions over to the to the Senate for the chief justice to read, to review and to vote on.\\n\\nFace of Justice\\n\\nAs the face of the third branch, Roberts has been a stout defender of the 870 active federal judges, knowing that many of the public views them as politicians in robes.\\n\\nThe chief, as he is informally known around the court, has publicly stated his long-term efforts to forge consensus with his colleagues whenever possible, show respect for precedent and preserve the court's reputation.\\n\\nIf we uphold a particular political decision, that remains the decision of the political branches, and the fact that it may lead to criticism of us is often a mistake, he said in 2016. We do have to be above or apart from the criticism because we, of course, make unpopular decisions -- very unpopular decisions.\\n\\nBut Trump has been more blunt, taking a results-oriented consistency when judging the judges.\\n\\nIn particular, Roberts' dramatic 2012 deciding vote upholding the key funding provision of the Affordable Care Act triggered conservative criticism that it was a calculated act of betrayal, a narrative Trump was all too eager to exploit on the campaign trail.\\n\\nTRUMP BLASTS HOUSE DEMOCRATS OVER IMPEACHMENT: 'THEY HAD NOTHING, THERE'S NO CRIME'\\n\\nJustice Roberts really let us down, Trump said at a campaign rally in December 2015. What he did with ObamaCare was disgraceful, and I think he did that because he wanted to be popular inside the Beltway.\\n\\nIn a rare public rebuke, Roberts responded a year ago when Trump criticized a legal setback over his immigration policy as the work of an Obama judge.\\n\\nThe chief justice responded, We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\\n\\nRoberts has voted with his more liberal colleagues to put some of the president's policies on hold. And just weeks after any Senate trial, he would preside over oral arguments concerning Trump's refusal to turn over his banking and financial records, in the face of subpoenas from House committees and a state grand jury.\\n\\nIt comes as the public still holds the Supreme Court in high regard. A Fox News Poll from early October found 68 percent of those surveyed have confidence in the institution, far greater than the president or Congress. But just two years ago, confidence in the Supreme Court was 83 percent.\\n\\nThe chief justice, for the most part, has maintained his steady, low-key leadership under both Republican and Democratic presidents, and the 64-year-old Roberts is unlikely to care much what is said about him personally. Life tenure on the bench gives him such security.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBut he knows maintaining his -- and the court's reputation -- during a hyper-partisan impeachment drama will test his leadership skills. Colleagues say he is fully prepared for the challenge.\\n\\nHe has a history of being a very impartial, fair, almost umpire-like justice, who calls them as he sees them, said Schaffer. I don't think he'll treat this trial any differently.\\n\\nFox News' David Spunt contributed to this report."}
{"original": "This is a rush transcript from Your World with Neil Cavuto, February 19, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nNEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, and thinking up that record jackpot for Wall Street, it is Vegas, baby.\\n\\nYou're looking live at the Paris Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, five hours from now, the top Democratic presidential candidates squaring off. Bernie Sanders is still surging, now with a double-digit lead in a new national poll, and Joe Biden is still hoping to pull off a win. He's not surging.\\n\\nMichael Bloomberg, meanwhile, still getting slammed from all sides. Democrats pounding the money he is making, while President Trump is just pounding.\\n\\nWelcome, everyone. I'm Neil Cavuto. Glad to have you. We're all over that, all over some new records at the corner of Wall and Broad in just a second.\\n\\nBut first with Peter Doocy if what happens in Vegas will stay in Vegas, and Jonathan Hunt with the president in Bakersfield, California, where Vegas is still very much on his mind as well.\\n\\nWe begin with Peter -- sir.\\n\\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, Michael Bloomberg is not competing in Nevada, but he's going to be on the debate stage this evening. And there's a ton of buzz about it.\\n\\nLook at this, front page of The Review-Journal, Debate Debut for Bloomberg, with a big photo. And while we don't know exactly how he's going to get along with the other candidates on stage, we do know a little bit about the kind of opposition research that his campaign is cooking up.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mike has what every public officials should have, passion matched with principle. Your legacy extends well beyond the five boroughs.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDOOCY: Part of the point there is that Joe Biden obviously has a very long record, but so does Michael Bloomberg.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBIDEN: Been a Republican his whole life. The fact of the matter is, he has -- he didn't endorse Barack or me when we ran.\\n\\nThis is a guy talking about -- he's using Barack's pictures, like they're good buddies. I'm going to talk about his record.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDOOCY: But Joe Biden is not the man to beat, according to an internal Bloomberg campaign memo that we got our hands on. And it concludes this at the end.\\n\\nIt says: The bottom line is that if Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar remain in the race, despite having no path to appreciably collecting delegates on Super Tuesday and beyond, they will propel Sanders to a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead by siphoning votes away from Bloomberg with no upside for themselves.\\n\\nAnd it's interesting because Amy Klobuchar's strong debate in New Hampshire is credited with helping her finish a surprising third place in the first- in-the-nation New Hampshire primary, so she might have some things to say tonight about Bloomberg's campaign gurus saying that she should drop out -- Neil.\\n\\nCAVUTO: It's amazing.\\n\\nAs you remind me, we're 3 percent into all the delegates that you need to win this thing, and they're already wrapping it up and concluding everything.\\n\\nAll right, thank you, my friend, Peter Doocy.\\n\\nNow to Jonathan Hunt. He is in Bakersfield, California, where the issue for the president right now may be water, but he is not taking his eye off what's happening in Nevada -- Jonathan.\\n\\nJONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's for sure. Neil.\\n\\nThe president is expected here in about 45 minutes. We are here in the heart of California farming country. And as you take a look at the audience behind me, it's a very enthusiastic reception that awaits the president when he gets here.\\n\\nYou might notice the desk on the podium there as well. That is because the president will be signing an Interior Department decision that is related to water rights. But the president began his day today, Neil, heading from Vegas, where he overnighted, to the Palm Springs area for fund-raising, millions of dollars, in fact, raised during a reception at the estate of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\\n\\nSo he was among the wealthy there certainly in the Palm Springs area. A lot of supporters as he drove from the Palm Springs Airport to the Rancho Mirage estate of Larry Ellison.\\n\\nAlso a couple of protesters on the hand. Unlikely to be an issue when he gets here, where Mr. Trump will be seeking the support and, of course, the votes in election 2020 of ordinary farmers. As part of that, as I just mentioned, he's expected to sign off on an Interior Department decision that rolls back endangered species protections that have essentially curbed water deliveries to Central Valley farmers.\\n\\nSo that's going to be a very popular move the president will make with the audience here. It will be very well-received. But as you were mentioning, Neil, as he makes this Western swing, the president very much is keeping his eyes on Nevada and that Democratic debate stage, which will be full of the candidates tonight.\\n\\nMr. Trump over the last few days has certainly seemed focused on the candidacy of former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And the president has been happy to echo some of Bloomberg's Democratic opponents concerns about the possibility or the accusation, at least, that Bloomberg is -- quote -- trying to buy the nomination away from the front-runner, Bernie Sanders.\\n\\nAlso, not unrelated to what is happening tonight in Nevada, the president will leave here, Bakersfield, California, and head to Phoenix, Arizona, where he will hold what will no doubt be another of those sold-out and raucous campaign rallies.\\n\\nIt is absolutely no coincidence, Neil, that that rally is scheduled to begin at exactly the same time the Democrats take the stage in Nevada. Mr. Trump knows better than anyone how to troll his opponents -- Neil.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Or to steal some thunder.\\n\\nAll right, thank you, my friend, Jonathan Hunt, in the middle of all that.\\n\\nSo say it ain't so, Joe? There's a new report via CNBC that claims several Joe Biden fund-raisers are jumping ship and are now supporting Mike Bloomberg. All this as Biden is hoping to revive the campaign with tonight's debate in Nevada and obviously get things going again in South Carolina.\\n\\nHe is not on the ballot in either state, I might point out.\\n\\nWith me now is former Obama economic adviser, much more than that, Robert Wolf, GOP strategist Joseph Pinion, and The New York Post's Kelly Jane Torrance.\\n\\nRobert, you're well-connected with a lot of these same folks. Is it your sense that financial types are backing away from Biden? Aren't they going to wait this out or what?\\n\\nROBERT WOLF, FORMER ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think they're going to wait it out.\\n\\nHe was here next week -- last week. The events were sold out.\\n\\nCAVUTO: He didn't get as much as he hoped, though, right?\\n\\nWOLF: That -- I don't know. I mean, what I heard from the campaign is they had a great first week post-Iowa.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: I think you know everything.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWOLF: You have to pay me more.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nWOLF: I think the best way to look at it is, unfortunately for us Democrats, there is no one coalescing around one moderate candidate.\\n\\nThey're all somewhere between 10 and 20 percent. And whereas Bernie and Elizabeth Warren that take up about 40 to 45 percent of the party, right now coalescing around Bernie, which is around 30-plus percent.\\n\\nSo I think we talked about the other day I certainly feel like the moderate side is a silent majority. But as long as we're doing what Obama said not to do, that good old circular firing squad we have going on right now...\\n\\nCAVUTO: Well, it's alive and well.\\n\\nWOLF: It's no question about it.\\n\\nCAVUTO: So, when you look at it, Joe, I mean, how -- the president is planning just to sort of steal their thunder. Usually, he plans an event right up to that moment. No different this time.\\n\\nBut it does steal their thunder, and I think he's enjoying their disarray.\\n\\nJOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes, look, I think he likes to give the side-by-side comparison.\\n\\nSo you have President Trump over here with six million new jobs, with wages going up, and you have Democrats over here. Iowa, they can't even count the votes. Now it looks like they can't even pick a nominee.\\n\\nSo, again...\\n\\nCAVUTO: But how is that even comparable? All right, so you have a problem in Iowa. It's not the same as the economy.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nPINION: Well, I mean, again, I think that's the point, though.\\n\\nWe're over here running the country, and they're over here not even being able to take care of basic political business.\\n\\nCAVUTO: What is their biggest worry right now? It always seems to me it could be Bloomberg. It was once Biden, because they really are pushing Bernie very hard.\\n\\nPINION: Well, look, I think -- again, I think Republicans have to be careful what we wish for. Again, I think that when you look at somebody like Bernie, all the symptoms and signs are there for the same things that people said about President Trump, that he's only getting 30 percent of the vote, that there are more people voting for somebody...\\n\\nCAVUTO: You know who the first person to remind me of that was you.\\n\\nPINION: Yes.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: No, seriously, be careful jumping the gun on it.\\n\\nSo, I guess, Kelly Jane, what I'm looking at here is maybe a snapshot where it could be like a prize fight tonight. I don't -- sometimes they never live up to those expectations.\\n\\nWhat do you think they're going to try to do to Bloomberg?\\n\\nKELLY JANE TORRANCE, NEW YORK POST: I think it's very interesting that people have been talking for years about how there's this battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party with Donald Trump and what happened.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: There's always a battle going on for the heart and soul of parties, though, right?\\n\\nTORRANCE: Exactly.\\n\\nSo, right now, the two front-runners apparently are people who aren't even Democrats until very recently.\\n\\nAnd I think that we're seeing a lot of what they're going to bring up about Mike Bloomberg with all of the different audio that's been leaking on stop and frisk, on women, on people in the workplace.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Have any of those been reflected in these polls that show him rising? Or is lot of that polling done prior to the release of these tapes?\\n\\nTORRANCE: I think most of it is done prior to the release.\\n\\nI think also, though, I mean, stop and frisk, what he said on the tape was pretty awful. But people have known that he's been for that. And I think a lot of Democrats have already been worried about how he's going to respond to that.\\n\\nHe apologized for it when he got into the race. But, for many, it wasn't enough. And let's face it. Joe Biden really needs something tonight, but he has never performed that well in any of the debates. And, in fact, most people who have done well in the debates did so when they were targeting Biden.\\n\\nI'm thinking of Kamala Harris, of course, on the busing thing.\\n\\nCAVUTO: That worked out like a charm, right?\\n\\nTORRANCE: Temporarily. I mean, Biden's still going. She's out.\\n\\nSo, I say don't count him out. But, at the same time, right now, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the one, of course, who has the most delegates. But nobody seems to think he can keep taking it in.\\n\\nBut, again, don't count him out. Everybody was surprised by his strong showing in Iowa.\\n\\nCAVUTO: No, you're absolutely right.\\n\\nNow, with the focus right now on Bloomberg tonight, he might regret accepting the invitation. Right? Or does he -- because it's been so widely telegraphed that he's going to be a pinata, what?\\n\\nWOLF: I mean, you and I spoke about it the other night. We thought that his best possibility was don't go to the debate.\\n\\nBut now I think we're at a point where he's had so many ads. You got to bring Oz behind -- in front of the curtain, all right?\\n\\nCAVUTO: Right. Right.\\n\\nWOLF: I mean, we used to say with President Obama, you know what, get in front of the rope line, not behind the rope line.\\n\\nHe has to start getting out and making sure people know what he stands for.\\n\\nCAVUTO: And Bloomberg is better than people think.\\n\\nI know he has this intellectual approach to everything and sort of non- emotional. But he got elected three times in this city.\\n\\nWOLF: And it's not a debate. Right? I mean, it's question and answer.\\n\\nPINION: Look, I mean, I think you look at somebody like Bloomberg, I mean, to me, I mean, there is a danger. I think somebody should still try to convince him not to go.\\n\\nHe's running the best funded art project in the history of American politics. And right now, he's basically the quarterback that held out of training camp, and he's showing up in the middle of the season, and everyone else is in midseason form.\\n\\nSo Amy Klobuchar is champing at the bit. You have individuals right now who are going to try to characterize him in ways that...\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWOLF: I know a bunch of Democratic strategists that will hire you right now.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAVUTO: He's been very prescient on a couple of key developments here very, very early on.\\n\\nWOLF: Yes, very sharp.\\n\\nCAVUTO: So, when you look at this and the media story, how is the media going to cover tonight?\\n\\nThey're going to be looking to see if Bloomberg stumbles badly, right?\\n\\nTORRANCE: They are.\\n\\nI mean, all eyes are on him. And I have to say, I'm interested to see which candidates really go after him. We know Elizabeth Warren already has on Twitter calling him an egotistical billionaire like Donald Trump, she said.\\n\\nBut how hard are they going to hit him?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: How is he going to respond to that? What did she again? Like...\\n\\nTORRANCE: Yes.\\n\\nAnd that's -- I think you have to worry about egging and being condescending. Secondly, how hard are they going to go after him, when they all want his money? Even Bernie Sanders didn't say that he wouldn't take that $2 billion that Bloomberg is promising to spend, no matter who wins.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Yes. We will see. We will see. They have to make nice for that.\\n\\nAll right. They can't go too far. We will watch it later on.\\n\\nMeanwhile, just to let you know, again, for those of you just tuning in, we hit some records today at corner of Wall and Broad. I'm sure the Democrats will be mentioning this tonight, Nasdaq and the S&P at new highs, the Dow getting closer and closer to one.\\n\\nBut are the candidates in tonight's debate really promising to deliver something very different, something that has nothing to do with those market numbers?\\n\\nAfter this.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, well, they hike, and the strong economy just takes a hike -- that is kind of the message behind the Trump campaign in The Las Vegas Review-Journal, slamming the Democratic rivals over their tax plans, which to a man or woman, mean at least trillions of dollars more in taxes over the next 10 years.\\n\\nThe only differentiator is how many trillions.\\n\\nVince Coglianese is with us, Susan Li. We got Scott Martin.\\n\\nYou know what's interesting, Scott, about the way the president's positioning it, whatever you think of me, maybe whatever you think of my tweeting or whatever, take a look around you. Take a look at this strong economy. And just go with that. What do you think?\\n\\nSCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: I love it. And he's right.\\n\\nAnd it kind of is one of those situations, Neil, where the numbers and the results are speaking for themselves, not these grandiose, hopeful plans of how things are going to work out so great for everybody, when we all know, I mean, in economics, there are winners and there are losers, not everybody wins, but people strive to win.\\n\\nAnd that's really the key behind a lot of the policies that Trump has introduced. And I think you just look around the Democratic side of things. We're going to learn more tonight. I mean, Mike Bloomberg alone on Wall Street, a major beneficiary of Wall Street, he was, and now he's got all these ideas that seemingly are going to take down Wall Street and penalize Wall Street for being as successful as it has been over the years.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Susan, the big drive for Democrats is, find us a winner. Find us someone who can beat Donald Trump. So they kind of put their passions aside in favor the candidate who can most and likely will embody that.\\n\\nThey're not quite sure about Bloomberg. How is that going down?\\n\\nSUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, on Wall Street, people are a little bit surprised, because, as Joe Biden pointed out, Bloomberg has been a Republican most of his life, meaning that he's a proponent of capitalism, lower taxes, less regulation, the trickle-down wealth effect, and now he's talking about a transaction tax on Wall Street, expanding the Volker rule, meaning more oversight for the banks.\\n\\nAnd this is counter to what he said 10 years ago, so they're hoping that maybe this is just before the primaries and he will move closer to the middle when the general election comes around, if he's still around.\\n\\nCAVUTO: How do you think it's going to go for him, Vince, on that idea? I mean, Bloomberg is moderate in terms of some of the other candidates.\\n\\nAnd I think his costs are a few trillion dollars over 10 years, with Wall Street transaction taxes and the like, higher taxes on the upper income, but they're all going to raise taxes. So how does Bloomberg try to differentiate himself? Or can he?\\n\\nVINCE COGLIANESE, THE DAILY CALLER: Yes, I don't think he's going to satisfy the left-wing base at all with these policy positions.\\n\\nEven announcing tax raises of any kind on Wall Street, it's going to fall on deaf ears, because he's a -- he's not a credible communicator on that subject. He is seen in the Democratic Party as a guy who got filthy rich off of the finance industry.\\n\\nAnd the big problem for him is convincing Democrats that he in any way deserves to be a part of this race, when the DNC clearly rolled out the red carpet and the velvet rope line for a guy who didn't even participate in the two first contests in this Democratic primary.\\n\\nThat's what he needs to overcome. Saying anything about going after Wall Street, it's going to fall on deaf ears.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, the president is fine with continuing to quote the markets and what they're doing.\\n\\nScott, it's something that's very, very important to him. It's hard to gauge where these markets go the rest of the year and all of that, but normally, normally they're kind of indicative of what's happening in the economy.\\n\\nAll seems pretty stable right now, the coronavirus uncertainties notwithstanding. Will that continue to be the wind at his back?\\n\\nMARTIN: I believe it will.\\n\\nNow, you make a good point, Neil. Things seem eerily OK, don't they? And this is after a lot of things that this market and economy have had thrown at it. I mean, tariff wars alone, the Federal Reserve just about a year or so ago that was hiking rates, instead of cutting them.\\n\\nBut, yes, overall, I think the economy has the wind at its back. And I think one reason we're seeing these record highs day after day, and we're going to see him probably tomorrow, too, after tonight's debate, you're going to see the Democrats continue to fray, and that's why the markets like it, because it gives Trump a better chance in November to pull this out.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Susan, when you talk to traders, what's their biggest worry like these days?\\n\\nLI: These days.\\n\\nCAVUTO: I'm sure it's not a focus on the campaign. I'm sure it's the virus, right?\\n\\nLI: Yes.\\n\\nWell, Goldman Sachs just came out with a note saying that the market isn't really accounting for how big of an impact coronavirus might have, especially when you have China talking about an economic crisis.\\n\\nThat's where they're equating the epidemic to at this point. There are some concerns that people are not really pricing that in properly, with these record markets still.\\n\\nCAVUTO: When you talk about record markets, and you talk about Michael Bloomberg being front and center, he's Mr. Market, he's Mr. Wall Street.\\n\\nAnd, of course, he made the terminals that became ubiquitous and made him a guy worth $60 billion-plus.\\n\\nSo, Vince, how does he handle that? Because he could end up sounding an awful lot like the president talking about Wall Street.\\n\\nCOGLIANESE: Well, of course.\\n\\nAnd he is transparently an oligarch. The dictionary definition is a guy who uses his financial resources to control political conversations, and that's what he's doing around the country.\\n\\nIn fact, tonight's debate will be interesting, because this is a liability for him. This is an opportunity for him to actually have to answer questions, instead of controlling the airtime that he has by way of the many ads that he's purchased literally everywhere.\\n\\nI feel like when I go to sleep at night, my dreams just start with a Mike Bloomberg ad. He's done everything.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCOGLIANESE: Yes, it's unbelievable. I don't even know how he got to that. But that's what he's done.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nMARTIN: Are you OK?\\n\\nLI: Do you sleep well then?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCOGLIANESE: No, not at all.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAVUTO: Well, that's the difference between your dreams and mine. Mine involve a Grand Slam meal at Denny's, but whatever works, whatever works.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAVUTO: Guys, thank you all very, very much.\\n\\nMeanwhile, all these remaining cruise passengers are now off the ship and, well, shipping out to their home countries. They have been cleared of the coronavirus, but my next guest and her husband, so far, they're not that lucky. And they're not that happy.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, now more than 2,000 are dead from this coronavirus, experts saying there could be undetected infections sort of morphing around the world.\\n\\nJonathan Serrie has a lot more on that -- Jonathan.\\n\\nJONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.\\n\\nToday, Japanese health authorities began allowing passengers to disembark from the Diamond Princess, which had been under quarantine. However, Americans on board the cruise ship received letters from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo informing them they will not be permitted to return to the U.S. for an additional 14 days after leaving the ship, which is now tied to more than 600 confirmed cases of coronavirus.\\n\\nThe letter explains the CDC has concluded that, despite efforts of quarantine, there was a high risk that passengers currently on board the Diamond Princess have been exposed to COVID-19.\\n\\nAn 83-year-old American woman who became ill after disembarking another cruise ship, the Westerdam, which finally docked at Cambodia, is in stable condition at a hospital in Malaysia. Her 85-year-old husband insisted on staying by her bedside. Malaysian authorities agreed to grant his request.\\n\\nAnd Iranian media are reporting that COVID-19 has claimed the lives of two elderly citizens in that country. If confirmed, that would bring the death toll outside of China to five -- Neil.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, Jonathan, thank you very, very much.\\n\\nMy next guest was evacuated from that Diamond Princess cruise ship before she and her husband were put under quarantine in Nebraska, where he has actually tested positive for the virus.\\n\\nJeri Seratti joins us now on the phone, Jeri Seratti-Goldman, I should say, with that story.\\n\\nJeri, thank you for taking the time.\\n\\nHow are you holding up?\\n\\nJERI SERATTI-GOLDMAN, QUARANTINED: I'm holding up really well so far.\\n\\nCAVUTO: And how is your husband?\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: He -- we're so thrilled, because we got here Monday.\\n\\nAnd he had a very high temperature getting off the plane and into the night, and then it broke and then it came back. And now last night he went through the night without a temperature, which is a huge blessing.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Oh, that's great.\\n\\nI'm curious. How are they handling you in Nebraska? Are you at a compound? What kind of a facility? Can you say?\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: Yes.\\n\\nSo we thought we were being taken to an Air Force base. That's what they told us.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Right. Right.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: We were on our way after we were picked up at the airport, that's Carl that you're seeing right now on the TV.\\n\\nSo, we were being taken away, and because, where we were, we thought we were on an Air Force base. We were not. And as we're driving, I said, this doesn't seem like an Air Force base. They go, oh, no, you're going to the Nebraska Medicine -- Medical Center.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Huh.\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: And so they took Carl to the hospital portion of it.\\n\\nAnd I'm in a -- I think there's only three in the country -- a specialty quarantine unit. And that's my room.\\n\\nCAVUTO: How does it compare to the ship?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: Not as luxurious. The luxury is not there, but I'm doing really well, really well.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Are you ever able to visit your husband?\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: No. I cannot leave my room. I cannot leave my room.\\n\\nAnd I still have tested negative and have no symptoms, so very blessed for that. And we were traveling with friends of ours from St. George, Utah. When she got -- she was the first to test positive. And the night before they called her, she had a temperature for a few hours.\\n\\nAnd that was the only sign she has had. And then she's been testing negative since she got to the hospital that she's in, Fukushima, Japan.\\n\\nSo what we're understanding, after talking to doctors here, is that you're either one and done where it shows up and you have no symptoms, or, like Carl, who had underlining symptoms -- he has Guillain-Barre syndrome.\\n\\nSo his immune system was already compromised. And that's why he has had a temperature a couple times.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Well, I hope he's going to be OK.\\n\\nI mean, how are you holding up just with the meals and the difference on the ship? I mean, they're delivered to you. You're locked in that room. Doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: Yes.\\n\\nWell, we're business owners. We actually own a radio station in our hometown of Santa Clarita, California.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Oh, all right.\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: So we're still working away.\\n\\nAnd I have a treadmill and workout equipment in my room, so I'm able to get up and kind of do my morning routine.\\n\\nCAVUTO: I have a treadmill too. I just don't use it that much.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAVUTO: But, Jeri, I wish you well.\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: Well, when you have nothing to do...\\n\\nCAVUTO: No, I understand. Hang in there Jeri.\\n\\nAnd my best to your husband. You're a trooper. You both are.\\n\\nSERATTI-GOLDMAN: Thank you so much. OK.\\n\\nCAVUTO: This is a book. You have a book in the making, young lady, so be well, Jeri Seratti-Goldman.\\n\\nCan you imagine that?\\n\\nMeanwhile, pardoned by the president and now thanking the president, and, all of a sudden, the press goes nuts.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, some exclusive new video just coming in of Roger Stone at Fort Lauderdale Airport. He's headed to Washington for that sentencing hearing tomorrow, this despite concerns the foreperson on that jury was biased against him -- after this.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nROD BLAGOJEVICH (D), FORMER ILLINOIS GOVERNOR: He's a Republican president. I was a Democratic governor. And doing this does nothing to help his politics.\\n\\nPresident Trump is a man who is tough and outspoken. But he also has a kind heart. And this is an act of kindness. And I also believe it's the beginning of the process to actually turn an injustice into a justice.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nCAVUTO: Of course, that's former Governor Rod Blagojevich thanking President Trump for commuting his 14-year prison sentence. He had been in there eight years. So he missed eight years of seeing his daughters grow up.\\n\\nSo, given all of that, you would think just the reunion with his family would be enough for everyone to be happy. Not so.\\n\\nThe president is getting it from both Democrats and Republicans slamming some of his clemency and pardon decisions.\\n\\nLet's go to Media Buzz host Howard Kurtz on this.\\n\\nHoward, I think what stands out -- it's always good to have you.\\n\\nHOWARD KURTZ, HOST, MEDIA BUZZ: Thanks.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Is that normally presidents of all party types do this more near the end of their term, in the case of Bill Clinton, a busy final few hours of his term.\\n\\nBut this president has been consistently doing these in spurts and in waves. I don't know what the issue is with that. He can do and pardon and commute to -- anyone who wants.\\n\\nBut it gets an unusual amount of press. What do you think of it?\\n\\nKURTZ: Well, this is an action by the president that is causing him to be absolutely denounced by the media.\\n\\nAnd I understand this part about Blago, because, as you say, even some conservatives and Republicans are upset about this.\\n\\nRod Blagojevich is the guy who not only sold Barack Obama's Senate seat, famously caught saying it was blanking golden.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Right.\\n\\nKURTZ: But he shook down a children's hospital for a $50,000 donation in exchange for millions in state funding, and never showed a smidgen of remorse.\\n\\nBut this has been portrayed by many in the media, Neil, as a dark, nefarious Trumpian assault on the criminal justice system, rather than controversial moves in the Constitution similar to those of other past presidents.\\n\\nCAVUTO: And what's interesting about it, you can argue whether the term that he was given, up to 14 years, was justified.\\n\\nKURTZ: Yes.\\n\\nCAVUTO: But many have looked at that and said, all right, for the crimes, it doesn't fit, and it hearkens back to something the media seizes on, the time that the judge might want to slap Roger Stone, a person that got prosecutors looking at a higher number.\\n\\nThe president obviously looking for a lower number. What do you make of that?\\n\\nKURTZ: Well, I make of that that, obviously, the president is not shy about intervening, whether it's Twitter or talking to reporters, about people who are sometimes friends of his or former associates like Roger Stone, who thinks have been treated unfairly.\\n\\nThe reason that the press is connecting these pardons and commutations, not just the Stone case, but saying that Trump is -- he now says he's the nation's chief law enforcement officer -- is because of The Washington Post story saying that Bill Barr's threatened or at least has told people he might resign as attorney general if the president doesn't stop the tweets.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Right.\\n\\nKURTZ: And the president is not stopping the tweets about the Stone case.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, so what happens if Barr were to resign? Then, all of a sudden, the narrative becomes there's a palace revolt, right?\\n\\nKURTZ: Right, but probably the Justice Department would be without a head for the remaining time in this election year, and then some people will be nostalgic for Bill Barr.\\n\\nSuddenly, all the people on the left who have been attacking Barr since the day he took office would be saying, oh, he was a man of great principle, he's our new hero, he's the new Mitt Romney and all that.\\n\\nBut you got to look back. I mean, Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother. He pardoned Marc Rich, who was a fugitive who had fled the country. George H.W. Bush pardoned Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-Contra scandal.\\n\\nAnd Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who had endanger American lives...\\n\\nCAVUTO: Sure.\\n\\nKURTZ: ... by dumping a ton of classified military secrets out there.\\n\\nSo I wish that this president and the others had just gone through the normal Justice Department system, rather than, in this case, the president relying on friends and family and allies. But he does have the power to do that.\\n\\nCAVUTO: You know, the president is going, with this big fund-raiser with Larry Ellison, there are thousands of Oracle workers who were very annoyed about it.\\n\\nI don't remember this kind of a big stink when other CEOs have given to Barack Obama or whatever. They can do what they want to do, but what do you make of the dust-up over that?\\n\\nKURTZ: I think it's hypocritical, because, obviously, President Obama, other Democrats have held fund-raisers or used the homes of rich guys, CEOs, people who run companies.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Right.\\n\\nKURTZ: And if most of the employees were all with it, even those who might have been conservative Republican, you didn't have this big stink.\\n\\nBut somehow the employees of a big tech company like that feel like it's a personal affront that their CEO happens to support President Trump. And, of course, the press just loves to jump on that.\\n\\nCAVUTO: They do, indeed.\\n\\nAll right, Howie, thank you very much. Good having you, my friend.\\n\\nKURTZ: Thanks, Neil.\\n\\nCAVUTO: That -- we told you about that Larry Ellison event.\\n\\nBy the way, Larry Ellison is even richer than Michael Bloomberg. He's worth about $69 billion, Michael Bloomberg about $60 billion.\\n\\nBut it's that kowtowing and that relationship that gets a lot of attention. Should it?\\n\\nAfter this.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: Well, President Trump greeted by protesters in Rancho Mirage, California, today.\\n\\nThe president there for a fund-raiser with Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Some Oracle employees, in fact, thousands of them, not too happy about that visit.\\n\\nHillary Vaughn in Rancho Mirage with more -- Hillary.\\n\\nHILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.\\n\\nWell, Palm Springs is called the president's playground for its history of attracting high-profile politicians to high-dollar fund-raisers.\\n\\nAnd, today, it was the scene for President Trump's latest campaign cash haul at Ellison's invite-only golf resort Porcupine Creek. This ritzy rendezvous in Rancho Mirage comes at an opportune moment for the Oracle founder, because his company is challenging Amazon in court over the bidding process for a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon that they ended up losing.\\n\\nSo, today, Ellison got some valuable face time in with President Trump, along with donors, some who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to golf with the president.\\n\\nTickets for two starting at $100,000 for a tee-off with Trump. Supporters who shelled out over a quarter-of-a-million dollars got to have some alone time with the president at a roundtable. Ellison has hosted other presidents at his exclusive resort here in Rancho Mirage.\\n\\nBut this was unique because it sparked a revolt at his own company; 5,000 Oracle employees signed a petition trying to stop this fund-raiser from happening, and several of them logged off and walked out of work today in protest -- Neil.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, Hillary, thank you very, very much.\\n\\nSpeaking about support that Hillary just raised, we're learning now from Politico that casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is throwing his financial weight and support behind the president's reelection campaign.\\n\\nHe's a multibillionaire, probably one of the Republican Party's most prolific givers. He's going to be holding a March 12 fund-raiser for the president at his Las Vegas home. It's apparently a very big home, so they can invite a lot of people.\\n\\nMeanwhile, another royal pain for Harry and Meghan. Let's just say they have a brand new problem.\\n\\nSee what I did there? It's about the brand.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAVUTO: OK, fine.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, we're told that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are announcing their royal duties will officially end come March 31.\\n\\nNow, this amid reports Queen Elizabeth herself took those duties away by saying the Sussex royal title that goes with their names will no longer go with it.\\n\\nI have no idea what that means. But I know one of my favorite guests on this subject does. She is an encyclopedia on all things royal.\\n\\nCharlie Lankston, the DailyMail.com editor.\\n\\nWhat does this mean, that they can't use the royal what?\\n\\nCHARLIE LANKSTON, EDITOR, DAILY MAIL: Yes, so they have basically Brown branded themselves as Sussex Royal.\\n\\nIt is the name of their very popular Instagram account and it's also the name that they wanted to use for their business ventures. So we know that they trademarked Sussex Royal for everything, from bandanas to notebooks. It's also what they wanted to call their charity venture.\\n\\nSo, effectively, it was their business. It was going to be that brand. And the queen has now said, no, absolutely not. You will not be...\\n\\nCAVUTO: So, she personally made that decision?\\n\\nLANKSTON: She personally, yes -- well, she will have had advisement from people within Buckingham Palace.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right.\\n\\nLANKSTON: But, yes, she is the one who has said....\\n\\nCAVUTO: Boy, you don't mess with the queen, do you. Yes.\\n\\nLANKSTON: Absolutely not. She's a very foreboding lady. You do not mess with her.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right.\\n\\nDoes any royalty attach itself to their names though? I mean, how big a deal is that? All right. We know your royalty, though, right?\\n\\nLANKSTON: Right.\\n\\nWell, if you think about it, William and Kate's Instagram account is Kensington Royal. So Harry and Meghan kind of followed that pattern, but no other royal has tried to create a personal brand for themselves. They haven't needed to.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Do you need that name, that label to profit off?\\n\\nLANKSTON: I don't think you need it.\\n\\nBut I think, for Harry and Meghan, it's a bit of a kick in the teeth, because they have invested a lot of time, a lot of money, tens of thousands of dollars in creating a very shiny new Web site, in trademarking Sussex Royal with all of these different products.\\n\\nAnd they now effectively have to go back to square one as far as creating a personal brand for themselves, so that they can gain financial independence, which is what they were so keen to do when they split from the royal family.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Are they going to be worth more money or make more money in this role than as full-time royals?\\n\\nLANKSTON: Absolutely.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Really?\\n\\nLANKSTON: I mean, yes, we understand that they -- we're talking Obama levels of finance here. They could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, if they capitalize on everything.\\n\\nCAVUTO: With what? Doing what?\\n\\nLANKSTON: Book deals, private speaking engagements, which they have already done, potential production deals with companies like Netflix, with Apple TV.\\n\\nCAVUTO: I see.\\n\\nLANKSTON: And then they also have the opportunity to kind of release merchandise, like they're talking about.\\n\\nI can't imagine how many people would actually buy a hoodie that says Sussex Royal or whatever it is that they end up putting on their merchandise in the future.\\n\\nCAVUTO: But does their flame ever fizzle out a little bit?\\n\\nIf they're out of the public eye -- and I guess you were reminding me they will always be in the public eye -- but do they lose their allure the longer they're away from the throne?\\n\\nLANKSTON: I think they're playing it very well, in that they're teasing the public.\\n\\nYes, they have retired from kind of public life, as it were. But we see glimpses of them every now and then. We had photos of Harry stopping by the grocery store to pick up his lunch today.\\n\\nSo, we get the...\\n\\nCAVUTO: By the way, that was so staged. Stop. Just stop.\\n\\nLANKSTON: Yes, I can't imagine -- yes, I can't imagine that he didn't think that there would be photographers.\\n\\nBut I think they...\\n\\nCAVUTO: Right. Did he money with him to pay for it? Because I didn't...\\n\\nLANKSTON: He had staff with him. So I think -- I mean, if it was me...\\n\\nCAVUTO: Staff.\\n\\nLANKSTON: ... in the grocery store, I would have said, the sandwich is free.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nLANKSTON: You take it, Prince Harry. It's all on you. You aren't earning money anymore. So, here, have a sandwich.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, so they're going to do well.\\n\\nWhere are they going to settle? Canada? What is that?\\n\\nLANKSTON: So, right now, they're in Vancouver on the very exclusive Vancouver Island.\\n\\nThey have been looking at properties there to buy, because they're currently renting. But they have also been looking at properties in Malibu and New York, our sources tell us.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Oh, wow.\\n\\nLANKSTON: Now, obviously, her family is in California.\\n\\nI think, if she wanted to get back into that celebrity lifestyle, California would make sense. But who knows? Right now, they aren't making any promises. But they still have four more official royal engagements in the U.K.\\n\\nThey will not...\\n\\nCAVUTO: So, they go back to...\\n\\nLANKSTON: Yes.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Where do they stay?\\n\\nLANKSTON: They will stay at Frogmore Cottage, their home that they still have.\\n\\nCAVUTO: That is the one that looks like Hogwarts, right?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nLANKSTON: Yes, exactly, the stunning property.\\n\\nCAVUTO: So, they still have that.\\n\\nLANKSTON: Yes.\\n\\nCAVUTO: It is stunning. And they had the whole thing redecorated and done for them.\\n\\nLANKSTON: They did, but they have had to pay that money back.\\n\\nCAVUTO: I got you.\\n\\nLANKSTON: So they have technically paid for these amazing refurbishments.\\n\\nSo they now get to put them to full use whenever they're in the U.K.\\n\\nCAVUTO: So, how do Brits feel about all this? I mean, they're like, a finger to the homeland. Right?\\n\\nLANKSTON: Absolutely. People are applauding the queen.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Is that right?\\n\\nLANKSTON: There were tweets the wazoo, people saying, well done, they should lose their royal titles. They're no longer members of the royal family.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Wow.\\n\\nLANKSTON: And a lot of people are actually delighting in poking a bit of fun at them and kind of saying, like, well, you wanted to put Sussex Royal on a pair of underpants. Sorry, you can't do that anymore.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Yes, yes. Regular pants maybe.\\n\\nLANKSTON: Regular pants, yes, down the side.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAVUTO: So, the brothers, are they getting along? Or are they fighting?\\n\\nLANKSTON: They're doing better than they were.\\n\\nCAVUTO: OK.\\n\\nLANKSTON: I don't think that their relationship has gone back to the closeness that it once was, but they are speaking. They are communicating.\\n\\nAnd William is supporting Harry in this new lifestyle that he's trying to pursue.\\n\\nCAVUTO: That sounds like they're not getting along.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nLANKSTON: I mean, I don't think they're as close as they once were, which is a shame.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right. That was very judiciously put.\\n\\nCharlie, you are the best at this. Thank you very much for taking the time.\\n\\nLANKSTON: Thank you for having me.\\n\\nCAVUTO: A lot more on this and the ramifications of a bigger issue here at home when we come back.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK) CAVUTO: All right, looking live in Vegas, baby.\\n\\nThe Democratic candidates will pitch their plans just a few days ahead of the Nevada caucuses, which wrap up on Saturday.\\n\\nWhat's interesting here for Republicans who say Democrats are just wasting their time, they hope to succeed on issues like health care, which galvanize their takeover of the House in the midterms. They think it can repeat here.\\n\\nBeverly Hallberg joins us, The Independent Women's forum, and Jason Nichols, the Democratic strategist.\\n\\nBeverly, the one thing you hear is that health care worked for us. It wasn't a wedge issue. It became the issue. And so, this way, we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about the jobs gains and everything else going on in the Trump economy. They're noteworthy. They're hard to argue again. So we're going to focus on this stuff, and maybe do better.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\n\\nBEVERLY HALLBERG, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Yes.\\n\\nWell, I think health care is becoming that economic issue, because what voters really care about is for their costs to go down in health care. I thought it was very fascinating this week, when Bernie Sanders went around touting his Medicare for all plan, that even the Culinary Union said they weren't going to endorse him and even said, we like our health care, and we don't want you to take it away.\\n\\nSo I do expect, on the debate stage tonight, in addition to the billionaire Bloomberg bashing that is going to be an abundance, for them to talk about, some of the so-called moderates to talk about their alternative to Medicare for all. This is what Amy Klobuchar is talking about.\\n\\nBut, regardless, Republicans are going to have to start talking about their plans for health care moving forward.\\n\\nCAVUTO: Another thing that's interesting, Jason, from the Democratic perspective -- you're the expert here -- that the idea that Michael Bloomberg has not to really pick apart the economy and the numbers and the jobs gains and the markets, but to talk about, with that success and the money you can raise from these who've done very well, to get to these other goals.\\n\\nHow is that going to go?\\n\\nJASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think Bloomberg is going to struggle tonight.\\n\\nHe has a whole lot to answer for, as we know, with so many issues in terms of stop and frisk. And one of the things that he's got to argue on Super Tuesday coming up is to convince African-American voters that he's on their side.\\n\\nAnd it's going to be very difficult, when you recently said that you supported redlining, which basically destroyed African-American wealth. And then you say, OK, well, I have got a plan for that.\\n\\nI think that it's going to ring hollow for him. But I think health care is a winning issue for Democrats across the board. We know that the president's handling of health care, he's at about 30 -- in the 30 percentile area in terms of approval for the way he's handled health care.\\n\\nWe know he's supported federal lawsuits that basically will take away protections for preexisting conditions.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCAVUTO: No, you raise a good point about how this could all sort out.\\n\\nBut I wonder, Beverly, if there will be a limit to how aggressively they go after Bloomberg. After all, this is the same guy who has promised to write a check to help the nominee, to help the party. They don't want to go too far, right?\\n\\nHALLBERG: He's bought a lot of influence over the years, not just with local communities across this country, but some of those individuals he's going to be debating.\\n\\nWhat is fascinating is, his team has already come out and said that this isn't his forte. He's not great at public speaking. So they're already downplaying the expectations just a little bit. So, hopefully -- they're hoping, even if he doesn't have a super strong showing, it won't hurt him too badly in the polls.\\n\\nBut, from a messaging standpoint, I do think he needs to be on that more moderate level. But he is going to be attacked tonight, because he has been gaining in the polls.\\n\\nCAVUTO: No, I think you're right. And keep the expectations low.\\n\\nOn that, Jason, I built a career on it. So maybe he should try.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nCAVUTO: But I'm curious.\\n\\nHow do you think it ends up tonight? I mean, they're fighting with each other, screaming at each other. They just endured the Iowa craziness and all. How are Democrats feeling?\\n\\nNICHOLS: I think people are feeling optimistic.\\n\\nI think some people are a little worried that Bloomberg is going to buy this thing. But I think, Bernie...\\n\\nCAVUTO: Well, if he did, would they support him? In the end, would they live with that if he were the nominee and support him?\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nNICHOLS: I think that there would be an exodus of Bernie Sanders supporters, people who wanted to see Bernie Sanders, especially if he has the most delegates and the most votes at the end of the primary season.\\n\\nCAVUTO: But most doesn't mean a majority. Right? You have to get that 1,991. If he doesn't have that, it's not a birthright. Right?\\n\\nNICHOLS: It's not a birthright. But, still, in elections, the people who have the most votes should win.\\n\\nAnd it seems like most of the party, I think, would support Bernie Sanders over somebody like Mike Bloomberg, who's really just pumping money into it.\\n\\nCAVUTO: All right, we will see. It's still early in the going.

{"original": "Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called for a racketeering investigation on Sunday following Amazon, Apple and Google's decisions to suspend the alternative social media platform Parler after Wednesday's U.S. Capitol riot.\\n\\nDuring an interview on Sunday Morning Futures, Nunes said Amazon, Apple and Google's suspension of Parler is clearly a violation' of antitrust, civil rights and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, which is a federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization.\\n\\nI don't know where the hell the Department of Justice is at right now or the FBI, the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence told host Maria Bartiromo.\\n\\nNunes argued that there should be a racketeering investigation on all the people that coordinated this attack on not only a company, but on all of those like us.\\n\\nI have 3 million followers on Parler, he added. Tonight I will no longer be able to communicate with those people and they're Americans.\\n\\nPARLER TO BE DOWN 'FOR A WHILE' WITHOUT AWS, EXECUTIVES SAY: 'WE ARE CLEARLY BEING SINGLED OUT'\\n\\nAn FBI spokesperson told Fox News, Per our usual policy, the FBI does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations. The DOJ did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\\n\\nNunes made the comments on Sunday hours before Amazon was reportedly planning to suspend Parler from its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit in a move that takes the site offline, unless it finds another hosting service.\\n\\nAmazon says the move was made for violating AWS's terms of services by failing to effectively deal with a steady increase in violent content, according to an email by an AWS Trust and Safety team to Parler, reported by Reuters.\\n\\nAWS was planning to suspend Parler's account effective Sunday, at 11:59 p.m. PST, according to the email. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the letter was authentic.\\n\\nAmazon Web Services' acceptable-use policy bars customers from using its services for illegal, harmful or offensive content. An Amazon representative declined to comment.\\n\\nParler is facing criticism over Wednesday's riot, which saw supporters of President Trump storm into the U.S. Capitol, attack police, vandalize the building and steal items from inside.\\n\\nScreenshots taken from Parler and shared on other social media platforms appear to show Parler users openly discussing plans for violence at the rally that preceded the attack on the Capitol, including bringing weapons and imagining how they would wield them against their political opponents.\\n\\nGoogle and Apple have already suspended the Parler app from their respective app marketplaces, with a requirement that the platform improve its moderation.\\n\\nREP. MACE PEGS TWITTER 'UN-AMERICAN' FOR TRUMP SUSPENSION\\n\\nWe're aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the U.S., a Google spokesperson told Fox News.\\n\\nParler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety, Apple told Fox News.\\n\\nThe effect of this is that there is no longer a free and open social media company or site for any American to get on any longer, Nunes said on Sunday.\\n\\nHe went on to say that Apple, Amazon and Google just destroyed Parler.\\n\\nRepublicans have no way to communicate, Nunes said, adding that it doesn't even matter if you're Republican or conservative.\\n\\nHe stressed that there is no social media platform left for those who don't want to be regulated by left-wingers that are at Twitter and Facebook and Instagram, where you get shadow banned, nobody gets to see you, they get to decide what's violent and not violent.\\n\\nIt's preposterous, Nunes stressed.\\n\\nAmazon, Apple and Google's suspension of Parler comes after Twitter's Friday decision to ban President Trump's personal account after the mob of his loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol, resulting in several deaths. The tech company accused Trump of inciting the violence.\\n\\nIn a statement on Thursday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that the block placed on Trump's Facebook and Instagram accounts will be extended indefinitely, saying we believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.\\n\\nFacebook owns the Instagram platform.\\n\\nBartiromo said on Sunday that all of these moves certainly feel like Communist China, where there is this crackdown on free speech.\\n\\nShe then asked Nunes what he plans to do about it as an elected official.\\n\\nIn response, Nunes noted that the hypocrisy of Big Tech suspending Trump and Parler knows no bounds.\\n\\nHe pointed to Hang Mike Pence trending on Twitter on Friday night, with about 14,000 tweets after the social media platform banned Trump due to the risk of further incitement of violence, according to reports.\\n\\nI think that's violence, Nunes said on Sunday, referring to Pence trending on Twitter. Is Apple deleting the Twitter app from the app store? Hell no.\\n\\nThese CEOs that are doing this should be prosecuted criminally, Nunes added.\\n\\nI've been talking to many of my colleagues, Republicans on the House side and a couple senators, he continued. We're going to look for legal options, do we have any legal options? Do we have our First Amendment rights? Are they being violated?\\n\\nHe went on to say that he believes federal judges have got to step in.\\n\\nLegislatively, you have to understand, this is not about Big Tech and that they're just in Silicon Valley and they're just trying to make money, no they're working for the Democratic socialist party, Nunes said. They're being cheered on by this. They are state-run media and really it's the communication system.\\n\\nThat's how people are receiving their information is through this funnel of very few companies that are being controlled by the Democrat socialist party, Nunes added.\\n\\nTwitter appeared to notice the Hang Mike Pence trend at some point: on the Twitter Trending USA site, which tracks the past 12 hours of the top 10 trending topics, the item does not appear.\\n\\nWe blocked the phrase and other variations of it from trending, a Twitter spokesperson told Fox News on Saturday. We want trends to promote healthy discussions on Twitter.\\n\\nWhen asked to respond to Nunes' comments, specifically that Big Tech companies are allegedly working for the Democratic Socialist party, an AWS spokesperson said in a statement sent to Fox News, AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we respect Parler's right to determine for itself what content it will allow.\\n\\n However, it is clear that there is significant content on Parler that encourages and incites violence against others, and that Parler is unable or unwilling to promptly identify and remove this content, which is a violation of our terms of service, the statement continued.\\n\\nWe made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content, not a decrease, which led to our suspension of their services Sunday evening.\\n\\nApple, Google, Facebook and Twitter did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment regarding Nunes' claim that the companies are being controlled by the Democrat socialist party.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nImmediately before Nunes appeared on Sunday Morning Futures, Parler CEO John Matze said on the program that what is happening is extremely scary and that it seems like the Big Tech moves are an effort to stifle free speech and competition in the marketplace.\\n\\nParler will likely go offline for a while Sunday evening given AWS' decision to suspend the social media platform.\\n\\nMatze told Sunday Morning Futures that the site will try to get back online as quickly as possible, after writing on the platform that the site may be down for up to a week.\\n\\nFox Business' James Leggate and Fox News' Peter Aitken contributed to this report."}

The law is very clear. I mean, we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, Trump said. This is a national emergency, if you look what's happening.\\n\\nTrump did not lay out a specific timetable for when he might take such a step, saying: I think we're going to see what happens over the next few days.\\n\\nThe president spoke to FOX News in Texas, on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he visited the border region to argue that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the United States. Back in Washington, Democrats in the Senate on Thursday failed to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border-wall money.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nSHUTDOWN REALITY SETS IN: Approximately 8,000 federal workers on Friday will face their first payday without a paycheck due to the ongoing government shutdown ... Roughly 420,000 employees have been deemed essential and are working unpaid. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. Democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the White House and across the country on Thursday to end the shutdown.\\n\\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown. According to statistics provided by the Department of Labor, 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.\\n\\nThe shutdown, which enters its 21st day Friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend.

Many questions surround Closs, 13, who was found about 70 miles north of where she was last seen. She was discovered Thursday in the town of Gordon in Douglas County, Wis., after she approached a woman who was out walking her dog.\\n\\nAuthorities are planning a news briefing for approximately 10 a.m. local time Friday.\\n\\nTRUMP'S EX-'FIXER' TO TESTIFY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney, has agreed to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Feb. 7, almost exactly one month before he starts serving prison time for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress about Trump's past business dealings in Russia ... In a statement, Cohen said he accepted the invitation to appear from Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's chairman, [i]n furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers. Cummings said the committee was in the process of consulting with Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller's office to ensure that Cohen's scheduled testimony would not interfere with the ongoing investigation into interactions between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\\n\\nWILL BEZOS' DIVORCE AFFECT AMAZON? - The divorce of the world's richest man, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, could leave the fate of the pair's massive fortune - and Amazon itself - potentially in the hands of Washington state courts ... TMZ reported Thursday that the couple did not have a prenuptial agreement detailing terms of a possible split. That does not preclude the possibility there was some type of post-nuptial agreement put in place.\\n\\nWashington state – where the pair live and where Amazon is based – is a community property state, as opposed to an equitable distribution state, like New York. In a community property state, all assets acquired during the marriage are considered marital property and subject to a 50-50 split. That means MacKenzie Bezos could be entitled to half of the entrepreneur's $137 billion fortune.\\n\\nBezos' most prized asset is Amazon. He is Amazon's largest shareholder with a 16.3 percent stake. If his wife gets half of that ownership, it could change the company's dynamics.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SOUNDBITE\\n\\nBORDER SWING - The number one reason they will vote 'for' him is because of his stance on border security – Brad Parscale, President Trump's 2020 campaign manager, on The Story with Martha MacCallum, arguing that swing voters are inclined to vote for Trump in the next presidential election because of his crusade for strengthened border security and construction of a wall.

{"original": "The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a legal opinion on Thursday saying that President Trump's administration broke the law by withholding defense aid to Ukraine — the issue at the heart of the president's impeachment trial.\\n\\nThat money, $214 million which had been allocated to the Department of Defense for security assistance, was appropriated by Congress and therefore the administration did not have the right to hold it back just because it disagreed with its allocation, the opinion from the nonpartisan government watchdog said.\\n\\nFaithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, the opinion said. [The Office of Management and Budget] OMB withheld funds for a policy reason ... not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that the OMB violated the ICA [Impoundment Control Act].\\n\\nUKRAINE INVESTIGATING WHETHER EX-DIPLOMAT WAS SURVEILLED\\n\\nThe OMB made clear Thursday, however, that it disagreed with the GAO report.\\n\\nWe disagree with GAO's opinion, OMB spokesperson Rachel Semmel said. OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the President's priorities and with the law.\\n\\nFurther, a senior administration official said to Fox News that they believed the GAO was trying to insert itself into impeachment at a time when media attention on the matter is high.\\n\\nGAO's findings are a pretty clear overreach as they attempt to insert themselves into the media's controversy of the day. Further, GAO has a history of the flip-flops, reversing 40-years of precedent this year on their pocket rescission decision, they were also forced to reverse a legally faulty opinion when they opposed the reimbursement of federal employee travel costs. In their rush to insert themselves in the impeachment narrative, maybe they'll have to reverse their opinion again.\\n\\nNYC'S SANCTUARY CITY POLICY UNDER FIRE AFTER FREED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ALLEGEDLY MURDERS 92-YEAR-OLD\\n\\nThe aid was later released to Ukraine after a now-famous whistleblower complaint was filed and after the fact it was being withheld was made public.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., responded to the GAO's report Thursday morning with a statement re-upping his demand that the Senate consider additional documents as evidence in the upcoming impeachment trial.\\n\\nThe GAO opinion makes clear that the documents we requested in our letter last month are even more needed now because GAO confirmed the president broke the law, Schumer said. All senators will get a chance to vote to obtain these documents next week.\\n\\nIRAQI REFUGEE LAUNCHES GOP CHALLENGE TO ILHAN OMAR: 'SHE NEEDS TO BE STOPPED'\\n\\nRep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., chairwoman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, said in a statement that she was concerned the Trump administration usurped Congress' constitutional authority.\\n\\nToday's report is extremely troubling because it documents in great detail President Trump's belief that he is above the law and his utter contempt for Congress as a co-equal branch of government, she wrote.\\n\\nThe Trump administration, through the OMB, withheld a total of about $400 million of security assistance from Ukraine last summer. This came after Trump asked Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelensky to investigate the family of his 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and while the White House allegedly was withholding an Oval Office visit from Zelensky in exchange for that investigation.\\n\\nThese actions are what fueled the impeachment effort against Trump, whose trial technically gets underway Thursday and moves into full swing next week.\\n\\nThe $214 million the GAO says was illegally withheld was allocated to the Department of Defense, while the rest was allocated to the State Department. The legal opinion said the GAO also had questions about the money from State, and that it was looking into whether that, withholding was proper.\\n\\nThe Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation, the opinion said. Instead, Congress has vested the President with strictly circumscribed authority to impound, or withhold, budget authority only in limited circumstances as expressly provided in the ICA.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe opinion raised further constitutional concerns about the lack of cooperation from the Trump and his executive branch officials with the GAO's investigation. The opinion's conclusion panned a reluctance to provide a fulsome response, on the part of the OMB and the State Department, which the opinion's author, GAO General Counsel Thomas H. Armstrong, said interfered with the GAO's oversight role on behalf of Congress.\\n\\nGAO's role under the ICA – to provide information and legal analysis to Congress as it performs its oversight of executive activity – is essential to ensuring respect for and allegiance to Congress' constitutional power of the purse, he wrote.\\n\\nThe President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, Armstrong continued in a separate press statement. OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent 'in a manner that could conflict with the President's foreign policy.' The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons."}
{"original": "A state panel on Monday banned the open carry of guns in Michigan's Capitol, a week after an armed mob rioted in the U.S. Capitol and following a plot last year to storm the statehouse.\\n\\nMoves to ban weapons at the statehouse have been pushed since April, when protesters opposed to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's COVID-19 restrictions, some armed with long rifles and other weapons, entered the Michigan Capitol demanding to be allowed onto the floor of a legislative chamber that was closed to the public.\\n\\nThe Michigan State Capitol Commission, which is responsible for overseeing the Capitol, had been reluctant to issue rules for firearms, but it shifted course Monday and issued the order to ban the open carrying of weapons.\\n\\nMICHIGAN STATE CAPITOL BUILDING BRIEFLY EVACUATED TO INVESTIGATE BOMB THREAT\\n\\nA spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who previously said the commission shouldn't be responsible for creating weapons policies, said last week that he would support an open carry ban after violence erupted at the U.S. Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters.\\n\\nA spokeswoman for incoming House Speaker Jason Wentworth said he wants everyone to abide by the rule, even though he doesn't believe the commission had the right to issue it.\\n\\nCAPITOL RIOT TAINTED TRUMP'S LEGACY, ERASED 'ALL THE GOOD HE DID THESE LAST FOUR YEARS': TRUMP VOTER\\n\\nThe speaker is grateful for the work of the Capitol Commission, but it does not have the authority to set policy in the Capitol, Lynn Afendoulis said in a news release. The speaker will be looking at options for handling that moving forward. In the meantime, the Michigan State Police will be enforcing the new ruling.\\n\\nCommission Vice Chair John Truscott said the commission doesn't write policy but is ready to address general security issues. He said state government will have to fund it.\\n\\nWe don't have a budget for security measures, so in reality, the governor and Legislature would have to deal with it, Truscott said. We've gone as far as we can go with the budget constraints we have.\\n\\nSome of the anti-government extremists accused in a plot to kidnap Whitmer had carried guns at lockdown protests at the Capitol last spring. Prosecutors say the accused ringleader initially talked of recruiting 200 men to storm the building, take hostages and execute tyrants.

Michigan State Police will increase its visible and unseen presence at the Capitol for the next couple weeks, spokeswoman Shanon Banner said in an email Monday.\\n\\nThe Michigan Democratic Party issued a statement saying that though it applauds the fact the commission has finally put their authority to use, it is not enough and that all firearms should be banned inside the Capitol.\\n\\nSen. Dayna Polehanki pushed an effort to ban all firearms from the Capitol by introducing legislation last year that died in session. The Livonia Democrat said Monday before the panel vote that an open carry ban does not go far enough and will lead to a false sense of security for those who work at and visit the Capitol.\\n\\nBullets are bullets, she said no matter what kind of gun a person brings.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThere is no reason any gun belongs in the Capitol, it's absurd, the world thinks it's absurd, Polehanki said.

{"original": "Rev. Raphael Warnock, who will take Georgia's Senate seat in the coming weeks, did not answer a significant question throughout his entire campaign: whether or not he would support adding more justices to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAsked twice during a Dec. 6 debate with Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Warnock dismissed the court-packing issue as a Washington obsession.\\n\\nAs I move all across the state, people aren't asking me about the courts and whether we should expand the court, he told the Atlanta Press Club debate moderator. I know that's an interesting question for people inside the Beltway to discuss, but [people in Georgia] are wondering what in the world are they going to get some COVID-19 relief.\\n\\nNine justices on the Supreme Court became the standard number in 1869, though no number is specified in the Constitution.\\n\\nPacking the court with extra justices was attempted unsuccessfully by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1937, who sought to force through parts of his New Deal that were ruled unconstitutional by the high court.\\n\\nLoeffler throughout the campaign predicted Warnock would work with Democrats to add justices to the court.\\n\\nThe radical left — including @ReverendWarnock — wants to pack the Supreme Court & stack the judiciary with activist judges who write laws from the bench, undermine public safety, and rip away our rights, she wrote on Twitter in late November. Not happening on my watch.\\n\\nLOEFFLER CONCEDES TO WARNOCK\\n\\nAfter his election win, Warnock said he wasn't concerned with the matter.\\n\\nProgressives across the country are celebrating that your election could mean adding two states, eliminating the filibuster, and packing the Supreme Court with more members, ABC's The View co-host Meghan McCain asked the reverend this week. Your colleague Joe Manchin has joined with Republicans to reject those ideas. Chuck Schumer this morning tweeted 'buckle up.' So you can understand how it's hard for Republicans like me to believe in the spirit of unity, and I want to know: Will you do the same thing as Joe Manchin and agree not to follow up on any of those things?\\n\\nWell I'm not focused on any of those things, Warnock said, adding that he was more concerned with health care. Sometimes these words just become political buzzwords.\\n\\nSenator, I do believe that average Americans care about packing the courts, and I just want to know if you would agree and join Joe Manchin and agree that you are not for that, McCain said.\\n\\nPELOSI, SCHUMER CELEBRATE GEORGIA SENATE WINS AND ANTICIPATED CONTROL OF CONGRESS: 'BUCKLE UP!'\\n\\nMy job is to take the concerns that are being raised by my constituents, Warnock said.\\n\\nThe idea of packing the Supreme Court gained momentum this year after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September. Democrats accused Republicans of stealing her seat after they pushed through the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the bench so close to an election.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff, Warnock's soon-to-be colleague from Georgia, opposed the idea of adding seats to the bench.\\n\\nWe shouldn't expand the Supreme Court just because a justice may be confirmed with whom we disagree on policy, he said in a September interview with Classic City News.\\n\\nYet, Warnock side-stepped the question in another interview.\\n\\nI think it's presumptuous for me to go further down that path -- talking about what ought to happen with the courts, Warnock said in another encounter on the matter in November. I'm hopeful that the people of Georgia will look at my life, look at my record and give me the great honor of representing them in the United States Senate.\\n\\nThe opposition of even a small number of Democrats would kill any chance of getting a court-packing measure through Congress.\\n\\nIn addition to Ossoff, Sens.

{"original": "SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to expand his nuclear arsenal and develop more sophisticated weapons systems, saying the fate of relations with the United States depends on whether it abandons its hostile policy, state media reported Saturday.\\n\\nKim's comments made this week during a key meeting of the ruling party were seen as applying pressure on the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has called Kim a thug and has criticized his summits with President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim as saying the key to establishing new relations between (North Korea) and the United States is whether the United States withdraws its hostile policy.\\n\\nKIM JONG UN VOWS TO IMPROVE NORTH KOREA'S TIES TO OUTSIDE WORLD AS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS PERSIST\\n\\nKim said he won't use his nuclear arsenal unless hostile forces intend to use their nuclear weapons against North Korea first. But he stressed North Korea must further strengthen its military and nuclear capability as the danger of a U.S. invasion increases.\\n\\nKim didn't cite any specific U.S. actions. North Korea has previously called regular U.S. military drills with South Korea, flights by U.S. surveillance aircraft and the American military presence in South Korea as proof of hostility. In particular, the North views the U.S.-South Korean drills as an invasion rehearsal, though the allies have repeatedly denied that.\\n\\nKim ordered officials to develop missiles with multiple warheads, underwater-launched nuclear missiles, spy satellites and nuclear-powered submarines. He said North Korea must also advance the precision attack capability on targets in the 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles)-striking range, an apparent reference to the U.S. mainland, and develop technology to manufacture smaller, lighter nuclear warheads to be mounted on long-range missiles more easily.\\n\\nNothing would be more foolish and dangerous than not strengthening our might tirelessly and having an easy-going attitude at a time when we clearly see the enemy's state-of-the-art weapons are being increased more than ever, Kim said. The reality is that we can achieve peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula when we constantly build up our national defense and suppress U.S. military threats.\\n\\nIt's unclear if North Korea is capable of developing such modern weapons systems. It's one of the world's most cloistered countries, and estimates on the exact status of its nuclear and missile programs vary widely.\\n\\nThe ruling party congress convened for the first time in five years. KCNA said Kim spoke for nine hours during his review of party projects from Tuesday to Thursday.\\n\\nThe congress is the Workers Party's top decision-making body, and it is being held as Kim faces what appears to be the toughest moment of his nine-year rule due to the triple blow to his already-fragile economy — pandemic-related border closings that have sharply reduced the North's external trade, a spate of natural disasters last summer and U.S.-led sanctions.\\n\\nDuring his opening-day speech at the congress, Kim called the difficulties the worst-ever and unprecedented. He also admitted his previous economic plans had failed and vowed to adopt a new five-year development plan.\\n\\nKim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump has remained stalled for nearly two years because of disputes over U.S.-led sanctions.\\n\\nWhen Kim abruptly entered talks with the U.S., he expressed his intent to negotiate not advancing nuclear arsenals in return for economic and political benefits. But as the diplomatic impasse prolongs, he's openly pledged to expand the nuclear program that he calls a powerful treasured sword that can cope with U.S. hostility.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nSome foreign experts say Kim never had any intention of fully relinquishing his nuclear weapons and only attempted to use diplomacy with Trump as a way to weaken the sanctions and buy time to perfect his arsenal. Months before his diplomacy with Trump began, Kim claimed to have acquired the ability to attack the American mainland with nuclear missiles following a torrid run of weapons tests in 2016-17.\\n\\nBut the tests invited new rounds of crippling U.S.-led sanctions that impose a ban on key exports such as coal, seafood and textiles and a significant curtailing of oil imports. Kim's state media have said those sanctions are strangling and stifling our country and are proof of U.S. hostility.\\n\\nSouth Korea's spy agency said Kim is worried about Biden, who is unlikely to hold any direct meetings with him unless North Korea takes serious steps toward denuclearization."}

{"original": "This is a rush transcript from Tucker Carlson Tonight, January 3, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: As well as in the campaign against ISIS. Though he was little known to the American public, Soleimani was among the most famous living figures in Iran and also among the most powerful. According to some accounts, second only to the supreme leader of that country. The Iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge against the U.S. in response to his death. Now whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. But it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs we could be engaged in a conflict, a real conflict, with Iran. From Iran's perspective we're already there. If Iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff, for example, would you consider it an act of war? You would. So, what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've seen in Syria, it was a pivot point. Neo-cons in Washington understood that immediately. Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qasem Soleimani, tweeted disgraced former national security advisor John Bolton. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran. That of course has been the neo-con objective all along. The president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that regime change and war are not the point at all.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nDonald Trump: We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. We do not seek regime change. However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors must end and it must end now if Americans anywhere are threatened we have all of those targets already fully identified and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: According to secretary of state Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, Soleimani was killed to forestall planned attacks on Americans. But as he later conceded, those attacks would've occurred in the Middle East not here in America.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nMike Pompeo: President Trump's decision to remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives. There's no doubt about that. He was actively plotting in the region to take action, a big action as he described it, that would've put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. And last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.\\n\\nMale Speaker: Was there any imminent threat to the U.S. homeland?\\n\\nMike Pompeo: These were threats that were located in the region.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Threats in the region. If you don't live in Washington, here's the translation. That would be in hostile middle eastern countries, places where American troops would never be in the first place were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like Max Boot [spelled phonetically] and John Bolton. But nevermind. No one in Washington is in the mood for big picture questions right now. Questions, the obvious ones, like is Iran really the greatest threat we face and who's actually benefiting from this and why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit? By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan 19 years -- sad years later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran? And so on. Nobody is thinking like that right now. Instead, chest beaters like Senator Ben Sass of Nebraska are making the usual war-like noises, the ones they always make. This is very simple, Ben Sasse wrote in a statement last night, General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans, which is essentially true. Soleimani was certainly a bad guy but does that make killing him very simple? It does not. Nothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever very simple and any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. Yes, Soleimani was linked to the deaths of Americans. Nobody mourns his passing. But Mexico and China are also linked to the deaths of Americans. Each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of Americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. So, does that mean we get to bomb Oaxaca? Can we start assassinating generals in the People's Liberation Army? Maybe. Maybe Ben Sasse will call for that, too. He's a former consultant and a very tough character. But before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. Our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the United States richer and more secure. There are an awful lot of bad people in this world. We can't kill them all. It's not our job. Instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of American citizens. Period. That's why we have a government. So, has the killing of Soleimani done that? Maybe. No one in Washington has explained how. Instead, like Ben Sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. He clearly was. So? That's irrelevant. Meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. We're praying they don't, but they could. How do we know that? Because we've seen it before. We fought quite a number of wars around the Middle East in recent decades. We attacked Saddam Hussein twice, as you know. In the end we killed him. We invaded an occupied Afghanistan. We toppled Moammar Gaddafi in Libya. We fought ISIS in Syria and then for some reason stuck around. We're still there. We joined humanitarian missions in Lebanon and Somalia. Our special forces have been quietly fighting in Yemen, Pakistan, Niger, who knows where all else. Many other places. In every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. The benefits? Often, they've been non-existent. A lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. Certainly, they did. Hope that makes you feel better. What do the American people think about all of this? Not that anyone cares. Well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. The killing of Soleimani happened just last night. But just five months ago after months of supposed Iranian provocation. American's didn't seem to view Iran as a major concern, not even close. In a Gallop poll taken last August, just 18 percent of Americans said that they backed military force to shut down Iran's nuclear program. Seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. So, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual Americans don't enter the equation at all. They're immaterial. In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well. He vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home, which are growing. Against the odds he won that election, probably because of that promise, but ever since Washington, including some around the president, have been committed to ignoring the results of that election and its implications. Washington has wanted war with Iran for decades. They've been working toward it. They may have finally gotten it. Douglas Macgregor is a retired U.S. army colonel. He's an author of the fantastic book, Margin of Victory, a frequent guest on this show and he joins us tonight. Colonel, thanks so much for coming on. Where do you think we're likely to go from here?\\n\\nDouglas Macgregor: Well, I'm told that tomorrow the Iraqi parliament is going to vote overwhelmingly to demand the removal of our forces from Iraq. If that's the case I sincerely hope that President Trump will take advantage of it and get us out. We should've been out of Iraq and Syria a long time ago as the president pointed out, as you have reiterated. We gain nothing by staying in the country whatsoever. If these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the Iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. But if we are going to fight the Iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. As for the active killing Soleimani, I think we can say with some certainty that Iran will respond. Probably not in the way that we would. The Iranians are not like us. They do not emote. You've been listening to people emote about how much they hate Soleimani and blame the failure in Iraq on Soleimani. That's nonsense. We failed in Iraq. The generals and the politicians are responsible for the loss of American life and the squandering of our opportunities in Iraq. Soleimani simply took advantage of it and Iran now controls Iraq. And after this airstrike and killing of Soleimani, we've actually forced them together because the people of Iraq may not like the Iranians, but they don't necessarily want their country turned into a battleground between the United States and Iran. So, I hope we'll just leave. That's the key. If we get out, then we're going to have to watch for what the Iranians are likely to do, and we can talk about that if you like.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: My sense, my strong sense is that the president's preference is to leave, that it's always been that he's sincere when he says he doesn't want regime change and he's not trying to start any wars. He understands that those are not in America's interest and they're not in his interest either politically. I'm wondering, though, if the people around him understand that.\\n\\nDouglas Macgregor: Look. He walked into a room at Mar-a-Lago with Senators Rubio and Graham, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor O'Brien, the Secretary of Defense Esper, and I assume Jared Kushner. You're talking about a room full of neo-cons. You're talking about the people that you've been discussing that have been urging war with Iran forever. They seem to have persuaded him that this airstrike made sense and that we should take the opportunity and do it. And publicly he's said that. I think it was probably unnecessary for the reasons that I've already outlined. This is not going to do anything for us strategically. As far as sending the message is concerned, his deputy has already taken over. The deputy has been with him since '97. This is going to stiffen resolve against us, and it's going to make any attempt to reach any arrangement with Iran virtually impossible. So, from that standpoint, I don't think it made a lot of sense. It's not necessarily helping us and what the president says he wants to achieve in the Persian Gulf with Iran.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: And quickly and finally, do you think it's likely if the Iraqi parliament issues a demand that Americans leave Iraq tomorrow, that we will?\\n\\nDouglas MacGregor: Again, I hope so. We have to recognize that Iran is a sovereign state. It has a sovereign government, whether we like it or not. If they tell us to leave, we should get out. Absolutely. No question. And I think President Trump should seize the moment, frankly, and get us out.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: I think he'd be relieved to do that. In which case, this would all be, I think, a win for our country. Colonel, thanks so much. Douglas Macgregor, great to see you.\\n\\nDouglas MacGregor: Thank you.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Johnny Joey Jones is a veteran of the war in Iraq, he lost his legs to an IED there. Soleimani is believed to have masterminded hundreds of IED attacks during the U.S. occupation of this country, so we thought it'd be interesting to speak to Jones. He joins us tonight. Johnny, thanks so much for coming on. You have a very personal connection to this story of course. We just explained it. So, I'm interested in your reaction to what happened yesterday.\\n\\nJohnny Joey Jones: Well, I think it's impossible to separate the emotional appeal of killing someone who deserved to die and the overall strategic kind of cautionary tale of what are we going to do next? You know, I wrote for FoxNews.com today that the tactical decision to send troops into Iraq that I was a part of, the troop surge got the al-Qaida out of Al Anbar, but would we do next? What was the strategic goal after that? Same thing, I was a part of a troop surge in Afghanistan when I lost my legs. We got the Taliban out of the poppy fields, away from the opium trade, but what did we do the next day? And that was the problem, and I think a lot of this is that politicians that hold each other accountable, they throw each other under the bus. So, when we change presidents, sometimes we change policy for that purpose -- so that we can be a contrast, not necessarily more right or more wrong. And so, it's not so much that I take issue or really have an opinion over killing this guy yesterday. It's what are we doing next? What is the strategy, not the tactical, what did in this one operation, but what's the overall point here?\\n\\nTucker Carlson: That, I think, that's always the unasked question. It ought to be the first question posed to our policymakers. What do you think the guys serving there right now are thinking or the ones who are just deployed to Kuwait? What's on their mind now?\\n\\nTucker Carlson: They're thinking, let's get some. That's what they're trained to do. That's their job. Their job is to be there, be ready and to not question so much why as to how and when. That's their job. But when they go, and they experience war like I've done twice and they come back and maybe they have an injury, maybe they lost buddies. They get 10 years older, 10 years wiser. They pay attention a little bit more to politics. And they say, Why was out there? What was I accomplishing, and what was I told? And how much of it was true? I think President Trump at this very moment is as inclined for military as he is diplomacy. And he's thrown the ball in the court of Iran today with a tweet to say, Listen, you're not going to win a war, but you might win at the negotiating table, because I think that is his end goal. And he may have made it through advisers or through his own wisdom to the point that he understands maybe that's all Iran will respond to. That's our hope. That's our hope today. Is that Iran responds to military force. We really don't have a playbook to see if they will, and it's quite a risk and a gamble. And it's ultimately the gamble of men and women just like myself.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Yeah, I think that's right, and thanks for reminding us of that. Johnny thanks for coming on tonight.\\n\\nJohnny Joey Jones: Absolutely.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Absolutely appreciate it.\\n\\nJohnny Joey Jones: Thank you.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Jim Antle is the editor in chief at the American Conservative. He's thought a lot about the political implications of all this. Jim, thanks so much for coming on tonight.\\n\\nJim Antle: Sure.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Where do you think this leaves the president politically?\\n\\nJim Antle: Well, a lot of it depends on what's going to happen next. I think President Trump --\\n\\nTucker Carlson: That's right.\\n\\nJim Antle: -- campaigned on the idea that we were going to shrink our footprint in the Middle East. I think that's what he'd like to do. I think he's trying to balance the fact that he would like to do that with the desire to be tough. The desire to protect American personnel that are still in the region, but he has a lot of advisers who are committed to the things that he ran against. He has a lot of George W. Bush retreads who are giving him advice on what to do with Iraq and with Iran, and the danger is that once you've done some of these things, once you've committed to some of these moves, you're going to draw more troops in rather than drawing down, as I think the president would prefer to do -- that there is no easy exit strategy; that there is no easy way out. So, the hope is that this strike is going to cripple Iran's capacity to be able to threaten our people. We can move on, and if Iraq does, in fact, decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, as was always likely once we put a Shiite government in charge of Iraq, that they were going to be friendlier to Iran than Washington was ever going to prefer, that we use that as a reason to get out, having accomplished everything that we're going to accomplish there. But there's no guarantee that that's going to be the case. And the big risk is that unwittingly, just as Barack Obama thought the Iraq war was a mistake. Donald Trump thought the Iraq war was a mistake, but the people end up doing some of the same mistakes, repeating some of the same mistakes that they campaigned against. What we really want to do is avoid an Iraq-like war with Iran.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: One group that absolutely does not think the Iraq war was a mistake are most Republican senators.\\n\\nJim Antle: Right.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Who are living in a world that very much resembles 1999, and I'm, and they're part of the reason this happened. They're the group pushing the White House onward toward regime change. I'm wondering how long it will take to get representatives in Washington who represent the views of actual Republican voters. When is that process going to come to fruition? When are we going to get senators who actually agree with Republican voters?\\n\\nJim Antle: Right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. And so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the Republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in Afghanistan and Syria, and the vast majority of Republican senators voted to rebuke him. And in the case of Syria, we're talking about a war that Congress never voted to authorize in the first place. Well, here we are in Iraq, and we have most Republican senators saying that they don't want Congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against Iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. I think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of Cold War 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, Republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing Democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped Trump win in 2016.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: That's right. It's exactly right. I mean, that's the difference in the parties. When Democratic primary voters want something, their party gives it to them. When Republican voters say they want something, their party gives them the finger and ignores them.\\n\\nJim Antle: Right.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: And that's tells you a lot. Jim Antle, great to see tonight. Thank you for that.\\n\\nJim Antle: Thanks for having me.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Well, another war in the Middle East probably would not be in the benefit, to the benefit, of the United States. Instead, it is our real number one foe that would benefit and that is China. What does China think of what's happening between the United States and Iran? That's next.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: We don't know where the situation with Iran is going but we can be certain that if it breaks into a full-blown war a few things will be true. It will likely cost much more than they tell you, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars. At the end America's likely to be weaker than it was in the beginning and we know this for certain, our biggest rival will be stronger. Who's our biggest rival? It's not Iran, despite what they tell you in Washington. It is needless to say, China. Well, we're continuing to squander money and blood in Baghdad and many other capitals in that region. China is growing its economy at home even as it expands its reach throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, even the heartland of the United States. One person who's paying close attention to this, one of the few who cares, is J.D. Vance, the author, of course, of Hillbilly Elegy and we're happy to have him on our show tonight. J.D., thanks so much for coming on. I don't think anybody mourns the death of Soleimani in this country anyway, but I wonder what the Chinese think as they watch this.\\n\\nJ.D. Vance: Well, I think one thing they're thinking is that just as the past two American presidencies have been bogged down in the Middle East in various ways this conflict risks escalating in a way that makes America focus on the Middle East for yet another few years, maybe another 10 years even as the Chinese grow in military might and economic power. And we know of course that they're planting various infrastructure and economic institutions all over Africa, all over Asia, that their entire economy is growing and flourishing and yet again we risk focusing on this small region of the world that is obviously important but not nearly as important as our biggest geopolitical rival continuing to gain strength and power.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Well, that's exactly right. And so now especially that this country's energy independent we were promised for decades once we became energy independent we wouldn't have to focus all of our energy in the Middle East. Now we are and yet our energies are still focused there and we're still ignoring China. Why do you think that is?\\n\\nJ.D. Vance: Well, I think for a couple of reasons. One, we have an entire generation of American intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the Middle East was just the most important region of the world. And so, one way of thinking about American policy really for the past 20 years, the George W. Bush administration, of course the Barack Obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. We basically had one new war per term, Iraq, and then -- excuse me, Afghanistan, then Iraq, Lebanon and Syria during the Obama terms and that's obviously terrible and I think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for America's national interest but viewed from the Chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. Of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for America's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that China was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. I think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the American foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: I mean, just a macro question to end on. Why is it so hard for our elites to police themselves? If someone is consistently wrong about the big things, why is he still in the same job? If we allowed our heart surgeons to keep working with that kind of track record no one would survive surgeries. So, why do we allow our policymakers to be wrong time and again?\\n\\nJ.D. Vance: Well, Tucker, I'll give you a cynical answer and then a less cynical answer. I mean, the less cynical answer is basically that a lot of people just aren't very good and very smart at what they do and honestly I actually hope that's the answer because the more cynical answer is that as our country has successfully bungled or sorry successively bungled middle eastern wars and allowed China to rise, there is of course a group of people who've gotten very wealthy off of China's growing power and that's the financial elites who actually run the country who donate to the think tanks of course that produce the policy papers that so many of our politicians rely on and so I do think that one way of recognizing that there's been a massive failure here is that the people who have not been in service of the American national interests are still collecting a paycheck and the people who have gotten it right are still largely on the fringes and I think that's fundamentally a story of incentives and a story of who donors are benefiting from and who donors are paying to effectively issue what is propaganda.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: I don't think that's cynical. I think unfortunately you're exactly right and thank you for saying so so clearly and out loud. J.D. Vance, great to see you tonight.\\n\\nJ.D. Vance: Thanks, Tucker.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Well, an armed civilian appears to have saved dozens of lives last week at a church in Texas. Really it was a wonderful, inspiring story. But on the left, at least an op-ed in U.S.A. Today argues those people shouldn't have been protected. Huh. We'll tell you what they said and why after the break.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\n[music playing]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Like most of his party's leaders, departed presidential candidate Julian Castro believed in taking away your Second Amendment rights. But don't worry, he said good guys with guns were a myth like bigfoot.\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nJulian Castro: More guns are not the answer. More guns don't make us safer. This idea that a good guy with a gun is going to stop a bad guy with a gun, it doesn't work that way.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Yeah, that's not true, actually. And we were reminded of that just last week. An armed civilian halted what could have been a massacre in Texas in a church, likely saving many lives. But over at USA Today on the op-ed page, they were distressed. The op-ed said we should be, and we're quoting now, Horrified that so many civilians in that church were carrying guns. Dana Loesch, host of The Dana Show. She joins us tonight to assess this. So, Dana, we should be horrified about a scenario that worked as well as it possibly could. An armed civilian stopped a massacre. What's horrifying about that? What's terrifying about that?\\n\\nDana Loesch: No, I agree with you, Tucker. And thanks for having me. I find it horrifying that anyone at USA Today would actually find it horrifying to save lives, to defend innocent people, because that's exactly what happened. I was also, and the reason to remind everyone that we have this video to go by, is because sadly, the church was live streaming their service that Sunday morning, as they always do, and it ultimately was captured. But you see in that video, Tucker, there are about five other law-abiding individuals who also draw their weapons, which is probably what would happen at my church. And I'm one of the law-abiding people who carry in my church, and we are encouraged to do so. But five other people also drew their lawfully carried, lawfully owned firearms, and they held. They watched and waited and took in everything that was happening before then, which indicates a level of training and a skillset that shouldn't horrify people. In fact, it should encourage individuals, because we were always told that if there is more than one firearm present in an area such as this, that there's a mass casualty incident or someone armed comes in to do murderous intent, that it would turn into the Wild West. Well, it didn't. It took Jack Harris one shot and six seconds to neutralize this threat. God bless them and God bless Texas.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: It's just so interesting that you could look at this scenario and say of people who are literally in church on Sunday, you're the most decent, responsible people in our entire society. That it bothers you that they are exercising their Second Amendment rights. I mean, the contempt for those kind of people just baffles me. Don't you want more people like that?\\n\\nDana Loesch: Well, and it's -- yeah. And it's anti-science. You know, when you talk about Castro and Beto O'Rourke and Michael Bloomberg and all of these other individuals that want to circumvent our Second Amendment rights, when they talk about criminal usage, we can't have a conversation about firearms unless we are also including, Tucker, defensive gun usages. These are individuals who are in lawful possession of their firearms. And these numbers – defensive gun usage is, according to the CDC from Barack Obama when he commissioned this in 2013. It has therefore, it's -- I mean, it's been affirmed many times over, as you know, that they vastly outweigh instances of criminal possession. So, why -- my actual fear is that people find this bad, that there are good people out there who take the time to educate themselves, to learn about their firearm and to train, as we saw all those congregants at the church do just a week or so ago with Jack Harris. And then Jack Harris probably trained some of them as well. Now, that's -- people should want to be able, they should be able to defend themselves. And we should encourage and empower people to do so instead of trying to shame them or smear them or malign their character. I find that disturbing.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Meanwhile, they're telling us that we're not allowed to take illegal firearms away from people. Stop and frisk is immoral, but we need to disarm churchgoers? I'm starting to think this isn't really about public safety. Call me cynical.\\n\\nDana Loesch: Right, right. No, I agree. And by the way, I said Harris earlier, and I have no idea where that came from, Tucker. I mean, Jack Wilson. But this whole situation with legacy media and many other individuals looking down their noses at good people who want to be able to protect themselves. I mean, for crying out loud, let's look at Maryland, for example. Maryland, back in just a couple of years ago, when they passed their National Firearms Act, I think this is 2013, 2014. It was all with the promise that, look, law enforcement is going to take care of you. The state is going to protect you. You don't need your firearms to protect yourselves. And then look what happened. Baltimore's homicide rate, their violent crime rate spiked by 300 percent. It's insane. People want to be able to defend themselves because they know that the state, even though the state promises them that they're going to do this, they never make good on it. In fact, some of the biggest errors that we have seen with previous mass casualty incidents had been because people in government have dropped the ball.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Of course, of course. Trust us. You'll be fine. Yeah, okay, no thanks. Dana, great to see you tonight. Thanks so much.\\n\\nDana Loesch: Good to see you, Tucker. Thank you.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: So, it turns out disarming you is just one part of the plan to remake your life. Imagine a place where the streets are lined with syringes and human feces, where the police no longer have power and criminals operate with impunity. Where there are literally more drug addicts living on the streets than there are high school students enrolled. There's no need to imagine a place like that. Unfortunately, it already exists. It's called San Francisco. For a century, San Francisco was the crown jewel of the West Coast, the single prettiest place in America's richest state, our Cape Town. Well, today it's become a kind of hellhole that only left-wing leadership could create. And make no mistake, activists want to make certain that your town becomes San Francisco. So, on Monday, this coming at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we're debuting an exclusive five-part investigation into what exactly has happened to San Francisco, into its collapse. We sent a crew out there for a week. The footage and interviews, they came on with our shocking. Here's a preview. Viewer discretion is advised.\\n\\n[music playing]\\n\\n[begin video clip]\\n\\nFemale Speaker: It's like a minefield because you never know what's coming around the corner.\\n\\n[end video clip]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: American Dystopia debuts Monday, 8:00 p.m. Eastern and continues all week. It's important, don't miss it. Well, up next, the Trump administration has allowed individual states to opt out of refugee resettlement, but it turns out virtually every Republican governor is asking for more refugee resettlement. Why is that? We've investigated. Plus, Boeing's outgoing CEO put his company into dire straits. In return, he could be getting 50 million dollars. What does that tell you about the way businesses are run in the modern American economy? We'll tell you just ahead.\\n\\n[music playing]\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Well, if you can remember that far back during President Barack Obama's second term, Republican leaders in the Congress made a big show of opposing the Obama administration's refugee policy. Obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled Syria's civil war in the United States and at the time 25 Republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. Now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. For example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. Often, it's impossible. Some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be Syrian. That was true for sure in Europe with the refugees. Some of them might be Islamic extremists. But terrorism was not the only worry they had. America's middle class is in decline. We already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. The last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. That's just true. And anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. As with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. So, before she became the most anti-American member of Congress, Ilhan Omar was a refugee. So, at the time the Republican governors got their wish and President Trump won the 2016 election. In 2019 he issued an executive order allowing cities and states to opt out of refugee resettlement. That's the last time we checked in on this story. Here's the amazing part. For some reason no Republican governors are taking advantage of that. Instead, you probably didn't read this in the New York Times but 18 Republican governors have explicitly requested that more refugees be sent to their states. Have their voters demanded this? No. So what's going on here? Ned Ryun is the founder of American Majority and author of Restoring our Republic. He joins us tonight. So, Ned, I don't think there's any evidence that Republican voters in the states have been begging their Republican governors to move more refugees in. So, why are these governors literally asking the federal government to do this?\\n\\nNed Ryun: This is unreal, Tucker. I mean, again, you pointed out that Trump gave him a strong backstop back in September and said you can opt out of this with his executive order and now you have these 18 Republican governors saying no, we want more. And they're saying well, we're following our hearts. This is, you know, Christian charity in action. I got to say this, Tucker, as a active devout evangelical Christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with Christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors and quite frankly a perverse incentive for these government-funded charities that are acting as refugee contractors grifting off the American taxpayer. Michelle Malkin has written about some of this but the U.S. State Department is paying these refugee contractors over $2,100 per refugee of which they get to keep 45 percent and then they're doing this campaign on these governors saying you have to put your Christian charity into action and in an act of cowardice most of these governors from red states are giving in to this. First of all, --\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Wait. May I ask a question?\\n\\nNed Ryun: I can't believe the perverse incentive.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: I don't understand how this works. Well, so people who hate Christianity are demanding that in the name of Christianity Christian governors admit refugees, but the governors aren't actually housing any of the refugees in their own homes or paying any of their own money so how is it Christian virtue to take in other people's money by force and give it away?\\n\\nNed Ryun: It's fraudulent.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: I don't remember that part of the gospel.\\n\\nNed Ryun: I don't either and Christianity to me is obviously living and preaching the gospel of Christ and living a moral life. I find this deeply immoral and I can assure you they're not preaching the gospel of Christ. It's fraudulent behavior, Tucker, using taxpayer dollars.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Yes.\\n\\nNed Ryun: To actually fund this. But the amazing part to me is the immoral behavior of these governors. They have one moral imperative. Their moral imperative is to advance the interest of the citizens of their state to do otherwise is to be immoral.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Exactly.\\n\\nNed Ryun: We have entrusted them with political power and our monies to promote our interests, not the interests of non-citizens. I have to tell you, Tucker, this is idiotic on so many different levels, but this is how red states become blue and how America ceases to be America. You can't continue this behavior. At some point there are consequences. These are red state republican governors doing this and Trump is doing all the right things and they're abandoning him on this.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Yes. I really wish we had run their names on the screen. I'm sorry we didn't. I hope you come back. I think we should keep hitting this topic.\\n\\nNed Ryun: Absolutely.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Because it's important. Ned Ryun, great to see you.\\n\\nNed Ryun: You bet, Tucker.\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Thank you. For more than 100 years the Boeing company has led international aviation. To this day it's measured by dollar amounts. Boeing remains America's single largest foreign exporter. But now like so many American institutions, Boeing is in trouble. Last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. There's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. Production is being suspended. In business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. How did it happen? Well, at least part of the responsibility lies with CEO Dennis Muilenburg who has been in charge at Boeing since 2015. Fittingly, Muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. Someone in corporate America is finally being held accountable for screwing up. But before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. According to recent SEC filings, Muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. That's his punishment. And by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. Here's some context for how much money that is. A rank and file employee at Boeing might make $60,000 a year. That's a decent salary in many places. It would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced Dennis Muilenburg is getting in his severance package. In other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, Muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 American households. And if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. Since 1978 CEO salaries in America's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. Meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. In 1965, CEOs in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. As recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. Today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. No wonder people are sending money to Bernie Sanders. That's what happens when you abuse the system. You discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. Now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. In Europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. Airbus CEO Tom Enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. That's a lot, but it was half as much as Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg made, and Airbus planes didn't even crash. This is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. It's dangerous for our country. Why? Well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like Dennis Muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. Attitudes are changing fast. Thanks to stories like this one, Americans are warming shockingly to socialism. Six months from now, a socialist could be the Democratic nominee for president. In a few years, this could easily be a socialist country. What would that look like? Well, of course it would be a disaster. Socialism doesn't work. It never has worked, especially not in sprawling, diverse countries like this one. Under a socialist regime, hundreds of millions of Americans would see their lives get dramatically worse, while demagogic morons like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would become vastly more powerful. That's socialism. You think America is stratified and unequal now? Wait till we get a socialist system. It will be so much worse. That's coming, by the way and at high speed. Why? Because mindless Chamber of Commerce libertarianism has allowed greed and stupidity to flourish in corporate boardrooms and unless we rein that immediately, right now, we're going to lose the system that made this country great. As of tonight, America is sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East, but the Iraqi government may soon say that they are not welcome there. So, what will happen next? We'll tell you as our coverage of the Iran crisis continues.\\n\\n[commercial break]\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Thousands of American troops are headed to the Middle East tonight after Iran's promise to retaliate for the death of General Soleimani. But thousands of U.S. forces already deployed in Iraq may soon be ordered out of the country. A lot going on tonight. Foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is in Jordan for us tonight. He joins us with more. Benjamin?\\n\\nBenjamin Hall: Yes. Good evening, Tucker. As you point out, the whole region has been on high alert all day, waiting for some kind of retaliation from Iran. But actually, what we heard reports of in the last couple of hours are possible strikes by the U.S. These are unconfirmed, we've heard conflicting reports. But there are suggestions that two cars were hit just north of Baghdad a few hours ago and that they contained more Iranian-backed Shia militias, including a key finance facilitated close to Qasem Soleimani. But of course, it is Qasem Soleimani that everybody is talking about. The head of the Al Quds Force, some people say the second most powerful man in Iran and the man responsible for so many hundreds of U.S. deaths. He was killed leaving Baghdad Airport early this morning, having flown in from Lebanon. A U.S. Reaper drone was waiting to take him out. And alongside him, the man who was in charge of the storming of the U.S. embassy. Five others also killed there. People are saying now that this strike may really severely strain U.S.-Iraqi relations. And in fact, the Iraqi prime minister spoke out earlier today and didn't mince his words. He said he condemned the targeting killing as a violation of the terms which underpin the U.S. troop presence in this country. And he went on to say that he has submitted a formal request for parliament to convene in order to adopt necessary measures to protect Iraq's dignity and sovereignty. He didn't say what those measures would be. But while some people are suggesting they might ask U.S. troops to leave the country, the U.S. is, in fact, sending more troops over. 4,000 to come into the region. They're coming from the Eighty Second Airborne. They're heading to Kuwait. 750 have already come into Baghdad to protect the embassy there. So, somewhat conflicting ideas at the moment. President Trump saying that he does not want war, that they killed Qasem Soleimani to avoid bloodshed because he was planning more attacks on Americans. But at the moment, suddenly heightened, heightened tensions here. Tucker?\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Sounds that way. Benjamin Hall. We're out of time tonight. We'll be back Monday. Have the best weekend.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

{"original": "The Trump administration on Tuesday announced that the number of miles of wall at the southern border had topped 450, a key election promise set by President Trump – with a top official saying that about 350 miles more is already funded.\\n\\nThis isn't just a remarkable achievement, I think it's an historic accomplishment for many factors, Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan said during a call with reporters.\\n\\nAS BORDER NUMBERS INCREASE, CBP CHIEF SAYS US FACES 'FULL-BLOWN CRISIS' IF TRUMP-ERA POLICIES END\\n\\nPresident Trump had made the pledge of 450 miles by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to show that his administration had succeeded in his central 2016 campaign promise of building the wall at the border. At the beginning of January 2020, only 100 miles had been built.\\n\\nMorgan said he was briefed that the goal had been met on Dec. 31, 2020, and said he thought back to those who said such a goal was not possible.\\n\\nWe were challenged and a lot of people didn't think we were going to be able to get it done, he said.\\n\\nWhile much of the wall has been replacement for existing structures, officials have repeatedly noted that the enormous 30-foot structures – complete with anti-climb technology and cameras – are radically different from the old landing mat that it replaced.\\n\\nThe wall was fiercely opposed by Democrats as well as immigration and environmental activists. Morgan praised President Trump for continuing to back the effort even as the administration fought against numerous lawsuits, as well as opposition to funding on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nHe actually listened and heard from the experts, from the folks on the border, on the frontlines of America's borders every single day, who are risking and sacrificing so much, he said. He didn't just hear them, he listened to them, he spent time with them, traveled down to the border, learned about the border, heard from them.\\n\\nMorgan has said that the 450 miles does not mark an end to the project, and pointed to $1.375 billion that was included in the recent omnibus spending bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump.\\n\\nThat money completes a total of about $16 billion for the wall system, Morgan said, which will fund a total of almost 800 miles of new wall.\\n\\nSo in addition to the 450 that we've already got on the ground, we've got funded 350 miles of wall system to go in the ground, he said. The overwhelming amount of those miles, that funding, the contracts have already been awarded.\\n\\nWHAT HAPPENS TO THE BORDER WALL UNDER A PRESIDENT BIDEN?\\n\\nThe future of construction at the border is unclear. President-elect Joe Biden opposed wall construction and has promised that there will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration.\\n\\nHowever, it might not be that simple. Morgan warned that with those contracts already awarded, it would cost the U.S. billions to suddenly walk away from those contracts and could cost thousands of jobs.\\n\\nThe challenge marks one of a number that the Biden administration will have to navigate if it wants to dramatically change track on immigration. Biden has promised to end a number of key Trump policies on illegal immigration and asylum – leading to fears that such changes could lead to a border surge and a new migration crisis.\\n\\nTop Biden officials recently warned that changes may take longer than some had expected.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nProcessing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off, incoming domestic policy adviser Susan Rice told Spanish wire service EFE recently. Migrants and asylum seekers absolutely should not believe those in the region peddling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on Day 1. It will not.\\n\\nMorgan called such remarks a glimmer of hope but also added that merely delaying moves like abolishing the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) would not mean that such a crisis would not happen.\\n\\nThey just kicked the crisis can down the road, he warned."}

{"original": "Lois Lerner's BlackBerry was intentionally destroyed after Congress had begun its probe into IRS targeting of conservative groups, a senior IRS lawyer acknowledged in a sworn declaration.\\n\\nThomas Kane, Deputy Assistant Chief Counsel for the IRS, wrote in the declaration, part of a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch against the IRS, that the BlackBerry was removed or wiped clean of any sensitive or proprietary information and removed as scrap for disposal in June 2012.\\n\\nThat date - June 2012 - is significant because by that time, ex-IRS official Lerner had already been summoned before congressional staffers who interviewed her about reports of the IRS' targeting of conservative groups.\\n\\nWe had already talked to her. Our personal staff and Oversight Committee staff had sat down with Ms. Lerner and confronted her about information we were getting from conservative groups in the state of Ohio and around the country, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told Fox News.\\n\\nIf you intentionally destroy evidence, that is a crime. If you make a statement in court saying the evidence is not available and it is, that is also a crime, said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice.\\n\\nThe IRS did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\\n\\nNews of the BlackBerry's destruction followed Monday's statement by Judicial Watch that Justice Department attorneys said in a Friday phone call the federal government backs up all computer records to ensure continuity of government in event of a catastrophe, but retrieving the Lerner emails would simply be too onerous.\\n\\nAn administration official told Fox News Monday night that Judicial Watch misinterpreted the Friday phone call. There was no new back-up system described last week to Judicial Watch, he said. Government lawyers who spoke to Judicial Watch simply referred to the same email retention policy that Commissioner (John) Koskinen had described in his Congressional testimony.\\n\\nBut Cleta Mitchell, an attorney who represents other conservative groups suing the IRS, cited a whistleblower who bolsters Judicial Watch's interpretation.\\n\\nI received information from a former Department of Homeland Security official who had security clearances. He just retired in April, Mitchell said. He contacted me and he contacted Judicial Watch and some members of Congress and said there is backup material.\\n\\nThe dueling versions are not likely to sit well with District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan, who is presiding over Judicial Watch's lawsuit against the IRS. He gave the IRS not one, but two opportunities in court filings with him to tell him where they were, said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. There was no mention of this backup system to the court at that time.\\n\\nAccording to Sidney Powell, author of Licensed to Lie: Exposing Corruption in the Department of Justice, Sullivan is known to scold government lawyers who withhold evidence.\\n\\nPowell said Sullivan appointed an independent counsel to investigate DOJ's prosecution of now deceased Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska.Sullivan described the Stevens prosecution as the worst case of misconduct he'd seen in 25 years.\\n\\nSullivan also said, When government does not meet its obligations to turn over evidence, the system falters."}
{"original": "This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, January 17, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nSEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: Buckle up for next week. We got a lot to go and we will be 289 days on Monday away from you having a final say. Let not your heart be troubled. Laura's next. Have a great weekend. Buckle up. Busy week, next week.\\n\\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington, tonight. The Senate might not be starting their trial today but the President is wasting no time. Ari Fleischer, Tom Fitton and Matt Whitaker are going to break down the new members of his legal team, the strategy that they're going to be employing. Why Democrats may come to regret demanding witnesses? We got a lot to unpack. Also tonight, top 2020 Democrats, they're struggling. Hillary Clinton's new documentary, and another Biden looks to cash in on sleeping Uncle Joe. Well, Eric Trump is here to react to that and how long can Democrats deny the advancement for Black America under Trump and just how much of the vote of African-Americans could Trump capture? Herman Cain and Leo Terrell, oh my goodness, I cannot wait for this. They're going to debate this new Wall Street journal piece, it's making a lot of waves and it's Friday so you know Raymond Roy is here. We got the Oscars. Apparently they're too white and to male. And also plus hypocrisy of course out completely out of control plus Prince Harry's embarrassing groveling to the Disney boss, all caught on tape, we'll get all of that but first. As the Senate jockeys over the rules for next week's impeachment trial, the President today announced his defense team and it's stacked with some serious legal minds. There's White House Counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow and just today, frequent guests on this show, it's like one of our legal panels, Ken Starr, Alan Dershowitz and Robert Ray, all added in various capacities. There's also Jane Raskin and Pam Bondi, both formidable female attorneys, they're just great attorneys, forget whether they're female or not. So you compare that all-star line-up, serious legal people, astute legal minds to the partisan hacks that Nancy Pelosi tapped for the prosecution. While six out of seven impeachment manager's hand-picked by Nancy, supported impeachment even before the whistle blower complaint. How's that for impartial? Further Schiff and Nadler and company couldn't prove that Trump committed a single crime and that's despite rigging the entire house inquiry and having the media in their corner. So do we really think Schiff is going to be somehow more convincing in the Senate chamber than Alan Dershowitz, a constitutional scholar who just so happens to be a liberal who didn't vote for Trump? Well, it's going to be a blow out for the Republicans and we're going to be covering it every step of the way. But here's the thing, the trial should even get this far. Mitch McConnell needs to put a motion to dismiss in the resolution that is going to govern trial rules. Now this impeachment is a complete farce, letting the trial play out with only validate the House's unconstitutional abuse of power. I've been saying this all week and I'm going to keep saying it. Joining me now is Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary, Fox news contributor. Also with me is Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch. Ari, looking at Trump's legal team, what's your take away?\\n\\nARI FLEISCHER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY & FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We'll, they're superstars but are they super stars who will work well together and divide the labor appropriately? That's the real question. There certainly have been great names, legal names. Each have story histories. You know, a lot of this work too is the leg work, getting information on witnesses to poke holes of witness testimony in case those witnesses are called. That's a lot of hard work and it's going to have to be done in a short amount of time.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, I think they've divided up witness by witness and argument by argument from the constitutional to the fact based arguments so I think that's already in process. Tom Fitton, what we've heard from the media are Cipollone is not a - he's not a media person. He's not done a lot of you know, sexy trial work so they're trying to like I guess, raise expectations, lower expectations for him. But I love the fact and you know, full disclosure, he's a close friend of mine so I know he's going to be fantastic but I love the fact that he's kind of an enigma to them because he's not someone who seeks the limelight. Well, any basic research into his background, he's an experienced attorney. My guess is he can handle politicians in the Senate and that process. You can see though why Nancy Pelosi didn't want the Senate trial to happen and that's why she obstructed it because now you're going to have all these politicians that they have pointed as impeachment managers come over and have to deal with real lawyers. I fear we're going to have a Kavanaugh type situation because in the ordinary course, the President's going to be vindicated in short order so they're going to think of ways to subvert that. This is why your motion for dismissal is a good idea. This is why they should knock Schiff out because he's conflicted. He's a witness and they should also consider doing preliminary hearings outside of a full Senate trial to kind of litigate these issues, about prosecutorial misconduct, about what Schiff did.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Senate should already be doing these types of hearings. Call Hunter Biden or can't Lindsey Graham call Hunter Biden, if they really want this in a separate hearing? I mean they're not going to do till after impeachment but these are questions that we've been asking and Ari, by the way Democrat Senator Jeff Merkley things anyone to bias to be a juror should step aside.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D-OR): They're going to have to search their heart and ask if they're able to set aside their preconceptions, all of us, all 100 of us and if we are unable to do that, if we're unable to in good faith say we'll set aside our preconceptions, look at the exact language of the House articles of impeachment, the exact evidence and how it fits, then we should recuse ourselves.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: So Ari, that's his input on the jury selection here of the Senate.\\n\\nFLEISCHER: Oh my God.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Doesn't that mean that every 2020 Democratic candidate in the Senate should also recuse themselves. I mean, the former candidates, as Senator McSally suggested?\\n\\nFLEISCHER: It's just such a joke on its face because what they're trying to pretend is as if they're a real court of law and they're not. If the founders wanted to put this in a real court of law for a real trial, they would have done so. Then impeachment would have gone to a jury. It's not, it's going to a political body. It's gone to the House and now it's gone to the Senate. The framers intended it to be political because they want politicians who are accountable to the people to make these final decisions about whether you overthrow the people's determination from an election so stop pretending this is a court of law. If it's a court of law, why are they reading newspaper articles about it? Why are they appearing on TV? Jurors are not supposed to read articles about the cases in which they're hearing. So aren't all those Democrats who read newspaper stories biasing themselves? No, because it's not a real trial and none of us should look at it the way, we do and the Democrats should stop this silly game. No one 's buying it.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Tom, we also have a situation where they are flouting this Lev Parnas who is an associate of Giuliani's. We're going to interview Mayor Giuliani on Monday. Exclusive interview here on the Ingraham Angle. We're going to ask more about that but Parnas himself, there's a bomb shell, it's going to change the whole trajectory of impeachment. Really?\\n\\nFITTON: I've been calling it the 'Gossip Girl' impeachment and Parnas has more gossip to add about things we already know about, that Rudy Giuliani was concerned about corruption in Ukraine. I don't understand what the news is here. Parnas is not providing any evidence of impeachable acts by the President of the United States. It's interesting in the gossip oriented way but the idea that he has any evidence to provide the Senate and that's one of the big issues here. You talk about a senator saying we have to consider the evidence. They don't have any evidence.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Right, no, so that's why they have to throw up these you know, late hits from someone who claims Ari, to read the President's mind. He's like, oh, Trump knew all about this. Look, how do we know he knew all about it? Well, it's his guess. Well, has anyone checked these notes? How do we know when they were written? There's no chain of command of the notes as you have to do in a - in a typical legal setting to authentic that they were written at a certain time and they meant a certain thing. There's an entire process to go through regarding such types of evidence and by the way, the foreign minister of Ukraine had this to say Ari, about Parnas.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nVADYM PRYSTAIKO, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, UKRAINE: Strangely enough my name was not mentioned although I'm Minister of Foreign Affairs. And frankly, I never spoke with this individual and again frankly, I don't - I don't trust any word he's now saying.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Vadym doesn't trust any word that he's saying.\\n\\nFLEISCHER: You know, what gave me so much doubt about watching him in those interviews that he was giving is, when people start to say, everyone's in on it. You know he had to be aware of it. Everyone's aware of it and they offer no specifics. So he says the Vice President was in on it, the Attorney General knew everything about it, without ever saying, in a meeting on such and so date at such and so place, the Vice President was informed by such and so. Total lack of specificity so it's one of these sweeping generalizations statements that candidates make. Witnesses don't because he didn't witness the specifics. He has nothing specific to provide and that maybe just shrug my shoulders and say this is a guy who curries up to anybody and everybody, he tells anybody and everybody what they want to hear. He did it with Rudy Giuliani and now he's doing that with the Democrats and with their favorite TV shows so I don't think he'll advance the ball one bit.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All right, gentlemen, thanks so much. Great to see you both tonight. So what's next? What's going to happen next week? Well, first, senators are going to vote on Tuesday on the resolution we've been discussing this week, almost every night and that resolution will govern the rules of the Senate trial. So set out length of questioning, rebuttal and so forth and now at that point, senators will be able to vote on whether individual witnesses will be called. There'll be a debate that happens and that's when things get very dicey. So if Democrats get their way, they'll do everything in their power to exploit these witness votes.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The precedent in impeachment trials in the Senate is to have witnesses. To have no witnesses would be a dramatic break with precedent. It would mean the first impeachment trial of a President in history with no witnesses. The first impeachment trial of anybody that went to completion in the Senate's 200 and some odd year history without witnesses.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Joining me now is Matt Whitaker, former acting Attorney General. All right, how easily could calling witnesses devolve into a political circus, next week?\\n\\nMATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: That's exactly what Mitch McConnell's trying to avoid but as you mentioned, it takes 51 votes to do about anything. We know the outcome of the trial. We just don't know how we're going to get there right now. So as I look at what the Senate is trying to accomplish, it is trying to keep a solid group of Republican senators together that keeps its train on the tracks. If they can't, then we could have Hunter Biden, we could have a whole host of folks be witnesses and that's when, I think the credibility of the Senate is really - could take a serious hit.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But there no - there's no understanding at this moment, how that debate about witnesses will ensue and unfold so we don't know if it'll be you get two, we get two. Doesn't know - we don't want one in one, witnesses period, yes, thumbs up so there's no sense and so there's concern that just the debate Matt, on that fact, could just throw the whole thing into a - I mean, more like the House than the Senate. In other words a lot of chaos or are we just - are we inflating what might- -\\n\\nWHITAKER: I think there's a lot of excitement, especially from the media that's going to cover this. They want fireworks. They want folks arguing. They want a lot of witnesses and a lot of controversy. Mitch McConnell doesn't want that. A lot of the senators on both sides quite frankly don't want that. They don't - you know they have a constituency back home that they need to be impressive to and to get re-elected. But fundamentally, the Democrats from the House have the burden of persuasion and if they can't prove their case in their initial 24 or so hours that they get, I don't expect that there's going to be an appetite for most senators to go further with documents or witnesses.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, the Clinton impeachment resolution included a provision for a motion to dismiss before the witness vote took place. Now it ultimately failed but it was an important point. I mean, it's a really weird thing like if they think it's absolutely going to be defeated so what, just put it in anyway.\\n\\nWHITAKER: The Clinton impeachment precedent is probably what we should follow because it was during the saner time where actually the Senate didn't have these partisan inflammations like we have currently in our country.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I like that phrase, partisan inflammations, it sounds like you need a really strong--\\n\\nWHITAKER: There's a drug for that.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, something for that. All right, New York Times' Michael Shear had this to say about the President's defense thus far.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMICHAEL SHEAR, NEW YORK TIMES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: We have still never seen what the President's legal defense of all of this is. We have seen his political defense, right? We have seen letters from Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel which are largely political arguments and we've seen the House members, the Jim Jordans of the world making largely political responses. We've never yet seen an actual legal defense.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, I don't know if Michael's been watching but there's been repeatedly noted that there's no underlying crime so what do you really have to argue here. There's an exculpatory transcript that no way rises to the level of impeachable conduct. So I don't know what he's talking about but it's politics too, sure.\\n\\nWHITAKER: This is the first time that a President's been impeached where there's underlying crime and on a purely partisan vote. So we don't have any elements of those crimes with which we can compare the facts that were you know, sort of developed in the House and this is why this is a very troubling time in American history, if you take a step back and understand, we've entered a new era of partisan impeachments which is not good for our Republic. And so I hope that the senators understand that and that they cannot turn this into a very partisan circus which is what we saw in the House.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Were you surprised that Pelosi started saying things like you're impeached forever. This is like Mean Girls. Like you're impeached forever like you're charged for it but if you were ultimately acquitted. It doesn't even matter if you're charged.\\n\\nWHITAKER: Yes, I'm surprised her rhetoric, how - how hot it has been. She called the Attorney General rogue again, suggested that he was a puppet of the President.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Moscow Mitch.\\n\\nWHITAKER: That has no place from the Speaker of the House and it - and it's really a shame that she does that.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, it may - plays well at the university cafeteria perhaps but the faculty room.\\n\\nWHITAKER: And the coastal elites.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, coastal elites. Matt, great to see you as always. I'm sure we'll see you next week. And coming up, there's new evidence that another member of Joe Biden's family was trying to make dough off the Biden last name. Eric Trump joins us on that plus a new piece asking what if Donald Trump won significantly larger portions of the black vote. Herman Cain, Leo Terrell with a can't miss debate, incendiary? You bet. Next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Have you actually taken the time to examine the top 4 Democrat 2020 contenders? It's an absolute train wreck. Now last night, we reminded you that even Barack Obama is wondering what's going on here, warning about the party's lurch to the left. So why did he feel the need to speak out? Well, because the so called moderates in the top tier, Buttigieg and Biden are sounding like this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Anyone who is in a. situation where they are in need of healthcare, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for.\\n\\nMAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG (D-IN) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Immigration reform isn't enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But what about the progressive? As we've reported this week, an all-out war has broken out between radical hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and socialist Bernie Sanders and there's fact, it's likely going to get nastier. Vermont's former governor, Peter Shumlin telling Politico, Bernie and his team feel they're holier than the rest. In the end they'll play dirty. Even if he considers you a friend like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie will come first. Joining me now, Eric Trump, executive VP of the Trump organization. Eric, great to see you tonight. No wonder the Democrats are pulling out all the stops to remove your father from office given what's happening in this top tier of candidates. It's wild - I've got to say this, it is wild watching this.\\n\\nERIC TRUMP, EXEC VICE PRES, TRUMP ORG: Yes, by the way, it's tough to watch, Laura. I mean, it's really, really tough. You have to - you get paid to watch it because of who I am. It is tough to get through it. I mean, here you have a group that's saying we want to take 160 million people off their private health care plans. It's nuts, right? I mean, you saw - you saw what Buttigieg said about decriminalizing border crossing. So let's just let everybody come. Let's pay for everybody's health insurances. Let's pay for all the problems of the rest of the world. It's crazy. You have Biden who is their front runner, who literally can't get through a sentence without stumbling. The rest of them are totally insane. I mean this is not JFK's Democratic Party. This is a totally radical Democratic Party and quite frankly, I think they're handing my father the win.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, it's not even JFK, that's not Obama's party. That's our whole point. Obama is saying to himself and has said publicly, yes, you know you can't - you can't just like basically drum everyone else out of the party because they don't sign on to the AOC plus 3 agenda. So moving forward to next week an impeachment, Eric, your dad's going to be out of the country at Davos. Big economic forum, world leaders, financial leaders, business types. Will he be watching this? Be honest. I know you're always honest but is he going to be watching the greatest clips, the greatest hits at the end of the day?\\n\\nTRUMP: Listen, my father's a sponge. He watches everything. I mean his ability to retain information is incredible. It's the best I've ever seen so yes of course, he's going to be watching, I'm sure parts of it. But listen, these people are crazy. If you look at Pelosi, right? I mean Pelosi, I keep on saying is handing him the win. We're raising tremendous amounts of money. I was in Ohio all day, yesterday. The amount of people that are coming forward, saying, listen, these people do not represent us anymore. We can't relate to these people and you know people see it for what it is. My father's signing trade deals with China. He's signing USMCA. He's signing all these great deals. We've got the greatest economy in the history of the world. We've got the lowest unemployment that we've ever had. You know, 401Ks are through the roof. I can go on and on and on and she's sitting behind a desk trying to impeach him because she knows that none of the candidates that we were just talking about before, can actually beat him, right? So this is their 'Hail Mary.' They're trying to throw a ball up. They know they're probably going to fumble it, at the end of the day. They know they're not going to win because you know no one on that stage actually has any sparkle. They don't have any twinkle in their eyes. They don't have any charisma. They can't win so what - what are they trying to do, right? I mean, they're trying to get very, very lucky. Throw a 'Hail Mary' and hopefully something will stick and it's not going to happen and he's going to totally get acquitted in the Senate and they're walking him into victory in 2020.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Eric, the 'Real Clear Politics' average right now. Joe Biden, despite their attempts I think to kind of knock him down a peg or two, he's still way up there. 27 percent. Now this is a national poll so people focus on state by state so I understand but still an interesting snapshot. Sanders is at 19. Warren's at 16. Buttigieg, who we've relentlessly seen pushed by the media and Hollywood, way down below everybody at 7.2 percent. So is this Joe Biden's to lose in my view. Politico, I think it was Politico had a headline today, you know, they - all their efforts have to not. Biden's still at the top of the heap. Doesn't he have appeal to African-Americans and more middle of the road Democrats, maybe even some independent? You're worried about him, aren't you?\\n\\nTRUMP: I think that's what they believe, at the same time as I said before, he can't get through a sentence without stumbling. He's got real problems. I mean here's a man that was in the Senate for longer than I've been alive, Laura, right? Yet he blames all of America's problems on my father. It's kind of ironic how that works. Here's a guy who gave Iran $150 billion. They ended up building missiles that they did shot at one of our air bases. Here's a guy a guy who has a son, who profited in you know off of the presidency of the United States, of a vice presidency of United States, took $1.5 billion from China just a couple days ago. ABC reported that his brother was doing the same thing as it came to charter schools in Florida. This guy's got a lot of problems. This guy has a lot of problems aside from the fact that he lacks charisma and again, he hasn't exactly been a good mouth piece for them because he keeps on stumbling and going off on these terrible rants. He's got real problems.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, speaking of Biden's brother, you referenced it and the $1.5 billion from China, he got right for his fund, it was not clear that it went to him personally but that's what we want to find out. We want to find out exactly how much he personally profited Hunter Biden which I don't think anyone really knows but it's obviously a lot of money. Joe Biden's brother has been caught now, you've referenced in passing, trying to profit off of his family name, just like old Hunter. ABC news reporting, Frank Biden touted his famous last name and prominent connections in Washington to help land a series of charter contracts from local officials in Florida to open charter schools, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars over a five-year period. They brought him in for his name one critic said. Well, Eric you made all the money and then your family went into politics, not you but these folks are doing it the other way around. They had no money. They went into politics and then their family members cashed in.\\n\\nTRUMP: It's kind of interesting how that works, they all get into - they all get into business when their father becomes Vice President or their brother becomes Vice President. We get out of business when our father becomes President, it's kind of interesting. But for the Bidens, this is a business. I mean there's no question they became a business. You see his brother doing it and by the way, if you actually tracked down the schools, Laura, they ended up all failing, right? I mean it was - it was another it was another Democratic policy that ended up going into total ruins because all the schools ended up failing. So not only did he profit off of it but the system didn't ultimately work. They didn't get the end results which reminds me of most of Joe Biden's policy.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, it's kind of funny because the NEA and National Federation of Teachers, they don't - they don't love, American Federation of Teachers, they don't love charter schools so I find it ironic that they goes into charter school and those particular schools apparently didn't do all that well. Eric, we'll be watching next week. We'll check back with you.\\n\\nTRUMP: Good to be with, Laura.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All right, thanks for being with us. So should Democrats be worried about the African-American vote? Interesting. A new Wallstreet Journal piece asks, Biden, Sanders and Warren would say these new minority jobs fell like manna from heaven. The workers getting them may credit the President. Here to debate, it's Herman Cain, former GOP Presidential candidate and Leo Terrell, Civil Rights Attorney. Leo.\\n\\nLEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Yes, hi Laura.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: First of all, how are you? Good to see you tonight.\\n\\nTERRELL: Thank you. How are you, Laura.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I'm great. Isn't the economy good enough across all demographics considerations to swing black voters, at least some to President Trump?\\n\\nTERRELL: No and here's the reason why Laura and this is why Herman will probably talk about abbreviated history. We have had economic growth for 121 months. 8 years of the Obama administration plus and you can check it out, Herman. Unemployment was 10 percent when Obama became President. It was 4.6. The only thing President Trump has given us is $1 million deficit for this year. To my knowledge, there's only 7 African-Americans I know who's going to vote for Trump. Herman Cain, Ben Carson, Kanye West, Horace Cooper, Diamond and Silk and Candace Owens. Blacks are not going to support Donald Trump this year. He won't get less - more than 8 percent.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: OK.\\n\\nTERRELL: Those are the facts. Hold on to them.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All right. Leo. Those are - no, those aren't facts. That's a guess or a projection. I don't want to quibble with words on a Friday night. It's a long week but I'm just teasing Herman. So Leo says it's not going to move any voters at all, this economy, because it was kind of it's always been growing.\\n\\nHERMAN CAIN, FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Leo is dead wrong and allow me to give you some statistical facts. First of all, two independent polls that I trust and most people trust, Rasmussen and Emerson show that 34 percent of black people support President Trump. Secondly, I travel all the time and I have people whispered in my ear, I love the Trump results. I love the Trump results. I go to a very large black church. Thirdly, look at what this President and his administration have done to directly impact black people. Criminal justice reform. Opportunity zones which impact more directly black communities and this is the only President including the last administration to basically authorize $400 million for historically black colleges and universities because they are struggling. Those are the absolute facts.\\n\\nTERRELL: Laura, can I just make one point?\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, go ahead.\\n\\nTERRELL: He did not address the 100 - he did not address the 121 months of economical growth but let me get to another point. Donald Trump has made it known and he'll get fewer black female support. Donald Trump has made it known that he has a problem with minorities. Charlottesville, the situation about the Hispanic judge.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Are you still parroting the - are you still parroting the - I'm not going to waste time on this, OK? Because he, I think on three different occasions clarified what the media had said he said in Charlotte. If you guys think you're going to win a Presidential election by going back to Charlottesville, it's just not going to happen. It's not going to happen. And as far as the economic recovery, this has been a recovery, including wage increases, that have been significant for blue-collar workers. All of the liberal economists, Leo, had said --\\n\\nLEO TERRELL, CIVIL RIGHT ATTORNEY: But it happened under the Obama administration.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Hold on. No, not for blue-collar workers. It didn't. and the fact is liberal economists have said consistently that Trump is doing OK, but it will really matter when blue-collar workers get wage increases. Sure enough, lower and middle-class workers have seen significant wage increases under this administration. And if you are going to tell me that that doesn't help some minority voters, then I don't understand how you're claiming factual understanding.\\n\\nTERRELL: It does. But let me ask you this, if blacks are coming out in droves to vote for Trump, why do they have to whisper it? Shout it. Be proud. Be proud.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: First of all, I don't think he said they were coming out in droves.\\n\\nHERMAN CAIN, TRUMP'S PICK FOR FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD: Allow me to answer the question.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Go ahead, Herman.\\n\\nCAIN: Allow me to answer the question, Leo, without you interrupting me.\\n\\nTERRELL: Please.\\n\\nCAIN: The answer is, they don't want to put up with the ostracism -- being ostracized by people who think that all blacks should vote Democrat.\\n\\nTERRELL: That's not true.\\n\\nCAIN: And I'm here to tell you, that is not how many of them feel. It is true. I hear it every day. I hear it at the church that I attend. That is why --\\n\\nTERRELL: OK, then yell it out. Let's get 10 percent.\\n\\nCAIN: Didn't I ask you not to interrupt me?\\n\\nTERRELL: Oh, I can't talk?\\n\\nCAIN: Let me give you one other point. People also, black or white, don't wear the MAGA hats because of the same sort of violence and destruction that some voices from the Democrat, liberal narrative have basically emboldened people to do. That's why --\\n\\nTERRELL: Can you tell me California -- can you tell me California come and show me the blacks that you are talking about? I don't see the blacks were whispering I'm voting for Trump. Can you come to California for about a weekend and we can go on a tour?\\n\\nINGRAHAM: California, we have to walk across the hypodermic needles and the homeless crisis to actually find people to interview, Leo, and you know that is the case. All right, so I wouldn't hold out California as a shining beacon of what is sane these days. I love California, it is a beautiful state, but they are ruining --\\n\\nTERRELL: If Trump is going to win battleground states --\\n\\nCAIN: Will you stop talking while I'm trying to talk?\\n\\nTERRELL: Go ahead.\\n\\nCAIN: Here is Leo's problem. California, New York City, and parts of New Jersey, Washington, D.C., do not represent the rest of America. Those are the people that I talk to every day. And those of the people I'm listening to.\\n\\nTERRELL: Where are the African-Americans in the battleground states -- just name the states, in the purple states, that are going to vote for Trump?\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Hey, Leo, here's what I'll say. If Donald Trump, let's say doubles -- or does better, you say he's only going to get eight percent. I think he's going to get at least 15 percent to 20 percent if he does --\\n\\nTERRELL: I will do whatever you want. If he gets 15 percent, I will do whatever you want. I will be at the Trump parade. I will be at the Trump parade.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: If he breaks double digits, Leo is going to come on, we're going to come up with something really interesting thing that you're going to have to do that's --\\n\\nTERRELL: Yes, 15 percent, I will do it. I will do whatever you want.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Leo and Herman, great to see you on a Friday night. Thanks so much, both of you, for joining us.\\n\\nCAIN: Thank you, Laura.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All right, and up next, it's Friday, and you know that means. Are the Oscars too white and too male? And the royals make a play for Hollywood, and we have video evidence. Raymond Arroyo breaks it all down, next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nAISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Aishah Hasnie. Former New York Congressman Chris Collins has been sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading. Collins' attorneys were looking to avoid prison time and push for probation, but earlier today a federal judge rejected their pleas. He must surrender to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on March 17th. The Republican was the first sitting member of Congress to endorse President Trump. He resigned from office in September. A mysterious and deadly virus has led to screening of airline passengers arriving at three U.S. airports from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Two people have died and dozens are ill with pneumonia-like symptoms. The screenings start tonight at New York's JFK airport and tomorrow at Los Angeles and San Francisco. I'm Aishah Hasnie. Now back to The Ingraham Angle.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: It's Friday, and that means it's time for Friday Follies. So male, so white becomes a new Oscar slogan, a pair of royals sell themselves to Hollywood, and the most inspiring moment on the Hill this week. Joining us now with all the details is Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. All right, Raymond, years ago activists labeled the Oscars so white for lack of diverse nominees, but now it's a new label?\\n\\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: This week when the best director nominees were named, including Scorsese and Tarantino, Mendez, among others, they were all white and male, which garnered this reaction, Laura.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Congratulations to those men.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow, you know you are in trouble and someone can throw shade by congratulating you. Those are just all male directors. Those are all very male movies. 19 of\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nineteen of the 20 acting nominees are white people. No women were nominated for best director. That's fewer minorities than in Donald Trump's cabinet.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They nominees are so white this year's Oscars are being held at Pottery Barn.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: Not only is this not funny, it's misplaced criticism. Stephen King, of all people, Laura, reacted on Twitter.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Liberal.\\n\\nARROYO: But listen, there is a reasonable thought here. I would never consider diversity in matters of art, he wrote, only quality. It seems to me to do otherwise would be wrong. He has been taken to the woodshed for those comments by everybody in Hollywood, but it makes sense. If you have an ailment, Laura, and you need a surgeon, you don't go look at the most diverse group of people. You go for the best surgeon no matter who that person is.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: That cheapens the entire award. But Stephen King ought to be a little careful, though, because what he says could a apply across the board in business, in schools --\\n\\nARROYO: Good.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: -- promotions, military. We want all people to get an equal shot regardless of skin color, ethnicity, because the best is always going to rise to the top. And the new generation of Americans, they don't even think about race. The really for the most part don't even think -- it's the most diverse country we've ever had.\\n\\nARROYO: But Laura, these categories are chosen by people in those respective fields. To think that they're engineering racism.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Oh, my God, they're the most liberal people ever, the people voting in the Academy.\\n\\nARROYO: It's like saying the Democrats have too white a stage. They chose to knock out these candidates, not because they were Hispanic or black, but because they weren't good enough to beat Donald Trump. That's why they're out. And Laura, to prove there is no conspiracy among Oscar voters, two of your favorite people got a best documentary nod. Barack Obama tweeted out Glad to see American Factory's Oscar nod for best documentary. It's the kind of story we don't see often enough, and it's exactly why Michelle and I hope to achieve with higher ground. Barack and Michelle Obama nominated for their Netflix documentary, imagine that.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I've never even heard of their documentary.\\n\\nARROYO: The bias in Hollywood is not this. The bias in Hollywood is ideological, and it's why Passion of the Christ and Eddie Murphy were not nominated and probably won't be, too politically incorrect. And if you had to nominate someone for an Oscar, Laura, I would choose Prince Harry. Over the last few weeks and that bombshell announcement that Harry and Meghan Markle were planning to withdraw from their royal duties, now video has emerged from July at a movie premiere, where Harry is seen pitching his wife to Disney CEO Bob Iger for best support performance supporting your wife so she can support you. Here is Prince Harry.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPRINCE HARRY, DUKE OF SUSSEX: You know she does voice overs?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, really?\\n\\nPRINCE HARRY: Did you know that?\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I did not know that.\\n\\nPRINCE HARRY: You seemed surprised. But yes, she is really interested. Sure, we'd love to try.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: So she would love to try her hand at voice overs. I guess the second career could always be agent to Meghan Markle if he runs out of things to do.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I will repeat that the best headline of all time, I think, was the headline in The New York Times, The husband formally known as Prince.\\n\\nARROYO: As Prince Harry.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: If you like women running the show, and then she runs the show. So that's the way it goes.\\n\\nARROYO: I guess so.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: If I had to nominate someone for an Oscar-worthy performance, it would perhaps be Senator Kamala Harris for fastest emotional transformation during a very solemn impeachment proceeding.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Thanks so much, we are here with Senator Kamala Harris, who, of course, a former 2020 presidential candidate and one of the jurors in this trial.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: Look at that. Remember Fanny Brice said 36 expressions? Kamala has two, and you saw both of them.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nARROYO: Don't let the fine acting fool you, though. We found footage of Kamala's actual reaction when those impeachment articles hit the Senate floor. Look at this.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(MUSIC)\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nARROYO: We don't want any laughs from Kamala Harris.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: That is just a joke, but it was kind of like with Bill Clinton at the Ron Brown funeral. I'm really going back in time.\\n\\nARROYO: Back to the archives.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: When he elicited a tear, I believe, after just joking nanoseconds earlier. So Clinton will still be in the Oscars hall of fame, lifetime achievement award.\\n\\nAll right, Raymond, thanks so much.\\n\\nARROYO: Have a great weekend.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: And coming up, her message of thanks to President Trump amassed nearly 6 million views on YouTube, and tonight an Iranian activist is here to tell the media and the Dems what Iranian citizens really think of President Trump. That's next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Iran's Supreme Leader -- I don't like saying that, but I said it -- today, made a rare appearance in public to call Trump a clown who can't be trusted, and praised the missile strikes against U.S. forces. The comments came two weeks after President Trump ordered that killing of Qasem Soleimani via air strike, and in the days since, of course, Democrats and the media have sworn up and down that this was ill-advised and had only united Iran. Is that really the case? We recently spoke to Iranian-American activist Erica Kasraie, whose viral video explaining how actual Iranian citizens feel has amassed nearly 5.6 million views. We started by asking her to respond to this from some in the media.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Soleimani's death seems to have united the people. We saw something like a million people turn out on the streets there.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The crowds are massive and emotional. There are many tears here.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The funeral, the scenes inside Iran, the sea of people, not just to mourn this man who was beloved by so many, but really they're rallying around a regime.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Erica, what's your message for the American media today? Nancy Pelosi said when you kill the number two in any country, people are going to get upset. The number two.\\n\\nERICA KASRAIE, IRANIAN ACTIVIST: Thank you so much for having me. What I want the American people to know is that the majority of the Iranian people view Qasem Soleimani as a terrorist who has terrorized the entire region, and they don't relate to the narrative that the left has been giving.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Look at the pictures, the size of the crowds. To people who might not know a lot about the region, that looks like a revered philanthropist, humanitarian, Oprah-like figure has been killed. Chris Matthews compared the death of Soleimani to how people felt when Princess Diana and Elvis died.\\n\\nKASRAIE: What most people don't know is that the regime intimidates people into going to these types of rallies.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: How so?\\n\\nKASRAIE: The government of Iran has about 4 million employees. So obviously they gave the employees the day off. A lot of people that you see there are from rural villages. They bus people in, they give them incentives like food. And as you know, right now, the economy in Iran is plummeting. People are hungry, they are jobless. The value of the dollar has decreased tremendously. So the people that you see at the rally not only are paid to be there, but they are intimidated to come.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: When you watch the coverage, as it was, whether it was the downing of the passenger jet, and you have members of the media, political figures running for president, others speculating that it was Trump and his taking out Soleimani that caused the domino effect that ended up taking down the plane -- in other words, blaming Trump. Is that fair, in your mind?\\n\\nKASRAIE: Well, with all due respect to my friends on the left, I feel like, since President Trump has been elected, he can do no right. They have blamed him for everything. And frankly, I think it is time for us to have genuine discussions and debates. And I felt like, for me, the reason I even made that video was because a lot of my friends were calling me and were like, hey, what you think about what is going on? And what is your opinion? And I just made a little video because I just wanted my friends did on my network, the Iranian and people are happy. And I was genuinely just nauseated. Why do we have sympathy for a terrorist, when I'm getting videos and pictures from people inside Iran that are happy?\\n\\nINGRAHAM: We have video, some pictures, by the way. The first photo I want to put up is photos of a few girls. It looks like they are mourning the death of Soleimani. So those are the kinds of images we see. What is the real story behind that image?\\n\\nKASRAIE: So, in Iran, I remember a time when I came to this country we would say the Pledge of Allegiance --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I miss that.\\n\\nKASRAIE: -- when we go to school, right? In Iran, children, their pledge of allegiance is saying Death to America and Death to Israel. So in Iran, children are forced to chant Death to America and Death to Israel. So that kind of indoctrination starts very young. And so what you see in this picture is children who are being forced to mourn. And so this is the regime's propaganda that they circulate in social media.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: And then women who seem to be, as you said earlier, seem to be really happy that Soleimani was taken out, we have a picture of that, as well.\\n\\nKASRAIE: Yes, this is two women who are celebrating. They put this video out on social media. These are the videos that, unfortunately, our friends on the left haven't had access to and refuse to show --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They are available. You can find them if you want to find them. We really appreciate you joining us.\\n\\nKASRAIE: Thank you so much.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Thank you so much for stopping by.\\n\\nKASRAIE: So I just want to give out a quick shout out to President Trump. There is a picture circulating right now on social media. There's a wall in Iran, as soon as the news broke, it's a hashtag, which in English translates to Trump, you're the man. So thank you, President Trump, for having moral courage to make such a hard decision.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Erica, thanks for bringing that to our attention. Great to see you.\\n\\nKASRAIE: Thank you.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: When we come back, President Trump and LSU's Coach O, a dynamic duo at the White House. Do you think they got along? Find out next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: It's time for the Last Bite. President Trump welcomed the college football national championship LSU Tigers to the White House today. Things got a tad colorful.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll take pictures behind the Resolute Desk. It's been there a long time. A lot of presidents, some good, some not so good.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTRUMP: But you've got a good one now, even though they are trying to impeach of the son of a -- can you believe that?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nTRUMP: Can you believe that? We've got the greatest economy we've ever had, Joe. We've got the greatest military, we rebuilt it, we took out those terrorists like your football team would've taken out those terrorists, right?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: It's supposed to be about them, Mr. President. I'm just teasing. Did you notice, by the way, Coach O gave him the nicest fist pump there? That's what I like to see. That's all the time we have tonight.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

She joins with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in urging Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to remove Trump from office immediately, calling him 'a very dangerous person' who committed an 'act of sedition.' Pelosi said if Pence won't act, the House is prepared to impeach Trump again. 'The president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' Pelosi said Thursday, a day after a pro-Trump supporters took over the U.S. Capitol. 'I joined the Senate Democratic Leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the Vice President and cabinet do not, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment.' 'The President of the United States incited an insurrection against America,' Pelosi added.\\n\\n\\n\\nTransportation secretary to resign in protest - USA Today: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will resign from her position, she announced Thursday. Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is the first Cabinet secretary to resign after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to halt the counting of Electoral College votes. 'Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,' Chao said in a statement. 'As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.' Chao noted her office would continue to help Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for transportation secretary, transition into his role.\\n\\n\\n\\nPence furious - Tulsa [Okla.] World: [U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe] hedged on who he thought might be to blame for what happened [Wednesday], but he allowed that Trump did not do enough to stop it. … Instead, Trump directed his disdain toward Vice President Mike Pence… By doing so, he may have alienated one of his most steadfast allies. 'I've known Mike Pence forever,' Inhofe said Tuesday night. 'I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today.' 'I had a long conversation with him,' said Inhofe. 'He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump).'' Aside from Wednesday's attempted takeover of the Capitol, the past few days have been difficult for Inhofe because he refused to go along with protesting the Electoral College results. 'We've had calls. We've had threats. … I have many very, very close friends mad at me, when all I'm doing is upholding my oath,' Inhofe said.\\n\\n\\n\\nKinzinger backs removal - Fox News: GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger has called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against President Trump following a harrowing day at the nation's Capitol. 'The president is unfit, and the president is unwell,' Kinzinger said in a searing video posted to Twitter on Thursday, a day after thousands of rioters flocked to Washington, D.C., to stymie the vote to certify the Electoral College tally for President-elect Joe Biden. Pro-Trump supporters, encouraged by the president's rhetoric, stormed into the building, forcing lawmakers into hiding for hours. He called on Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet to use the Constitutional amendment to declare Trump unfit for office and 'ensure the next few weeks are safe for the American people.'\\n\\n\\n\\nBarr: Trump committed 'betrayal of his office' - Politico: Former Attorney General William Barr accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of a 'betrayal of his office' — the latest rebuke of the president by a former high-ranking administration official after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. 'Orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable,' Barr said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. 'The President's conduct yesterday was a betrayal of his office and supporters.' Barr's criticism on Thursday was not his first public comment on the chaos at the Capitol. As the president's supporters breached the building on Wednesday afternoon, he released a statement through his spokesperson that did not refer to Trump by name. 'The violence at the Capitol Building is outrageous and despicable,' Barr said on Wednesday. 'Federal agencies should move immediately to disperse it.'\\n\\n\\n\\nTop officials leave over Trump misconduct - Fox News: With just two weeks left before the Trump administration vacates Washington D.C., some staffers are resigning in protest after demonstrations breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by protesters following a speech by President Trump. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, East Wing Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, and Social Secretary Rickie Niceta all submitted their resignations after pro-Trump supporters mobbed the U.S. Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. Late Thursday morning, a senior administration official told Fox News that Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, resigned Wednesday afternoon as a result of the president's actions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mick Mulvaney -- special envoy to Northern Ireland and President Trump's former chief of staff -- on Thursday also resigned, telling CNBC: 'I can't stay here.'\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump repeats claims that drove mob in response to certification - Fox News: President Trump promised an 'orderly transition' on Jan. 20 after Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory. The certification came after a day in Washington, D.C., that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from Trump on Twitter that called for calm in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,' the statement read.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: RAYS OF GLORY FROM THE GLOOM\\n\\nIf now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated. – Alexander Hamilton, in his essay The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, Federalist No. 9\\n\\n\\n\\nTIME OUT: IT MUST HAVE BEEN MOONGLOW\\n\\nThe Writer's Almanac: On this date in 1610, Galileo wrote a letter describing his discovery of three of Jupiter's moons. He discovered them in December, after improving his telescope design. He wasn't sure at first they were moons; he thought they were fixed stars. He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers. Marius's names stuck, and today we know the moons as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nGOT A WILD PITCH?

Garland serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in 2016. But his nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued the American people should have a say in selecting the president who fills the vacancy. In addition to serving on the D.C. Circuit, where he was its chief judge until February 2020, Garland is a veteran of the Justice Department, leading the prosecutions of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Ted Kaczynski, the 'Unabomber.'\\n\\n\\n\\nBiden said to pick Boston mayor as Labor boss - Politico: President-elect Joe Biden has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former top union leader, to serve as his Labor secretary, according to four sources, ending a selection process that split the labor movement and stoked diversity concerns among Democrats. Walsh beat out a host of other names floated for the position, including Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris, California Labor Secretary Julie Su and AFL-CIO Chief Economist Bill Spriggs. His selection suggests that Biden was willing to overlook calls for a diversity choice, since Walsh is a white man, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders had been lobbying heavily for Su. Spriggs is Black.\\n\\n\\n\\nBiden reportedly will name R.I. governor to lead Commerce - WSJ: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo as his commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California economic development official, to lead the Small Business Administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Raimondo was elected as the first female governor of Rhode Island in 2014. Before that, she served as the state's general treasurer. She also led the Democratic Governors Association from 2018 to 2019. Before she entered public service, Ms. Raimondo co-founded Point Judith Capital, a venture-capital firm. Ms. Guzman was a senior official at the SBA during the Obama administration, serving as deputy chief of staff. In 2019, she became the director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she helped implement a grant program for businesses affected by the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nCotton condemns tactics used by Cruz, Hawley - The Hill\\n\\n\\n\\nThe complete list of lawmakers who backed Trump bid to steal election - NYT\\n\\n\\n\\nHoyer announces no sessions of the House until after the inauguration - Fox News\\n\\n\\n\\nPence chief of staff says Trump locked him out of White House - NY Post\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Judge's Ruling: COVID restrictions violate our natural rights to personal liberty - Fox News\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDIBLE: 'GETTING IN TUNE TO THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW'\\n\\nThe rule of law is not just some lawyer's turn of phrase. It is the essence of our democracy. – Merrick Garland in a speech after President-elect Joe Biden introduced him as his attorney general pick on Thursday, per The Atlantic.\\n\\n\\n\\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\\n\\nI was just sitting here wishing I could get Stirewalt's take on today's events, lamenting that there would probably be no Halftime Report today. Then this showed up in my inbox. We love you, Chris -- thank you. … I had held a cynical take on all this election fraud nonsense (that it was to raise money, or pressure states to rollback their vote-by-mail programs, or both). But I struggle to reconcile that take with the call with Brad Raffensperger. I do worry that Trump has now spent 8 weeks drinking his own Kool-Aid. – Shawn A. Van Ness, Browns Point, Wash.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Ed. note: As much as I wanted to just melt into a puddle after staying up all night for the Georgia runoffs and then a day spent watching the riot, I knew I needed to be with you lovely people. You did me more good than I did you, I promise.]\\n\\n\\n\\nI agree with every carefully chosen word you wrote [Wednesday] about the attack on our Capitol, our country and [the Republican] Party. I am, as Mitt Romney once claimed to be 'severely conservative.' There is no time for whatboutism or 'Antifa is bad too' today. I'm without words to say more. Maybe you can keep writing for all of us. – Brian D. Liddicoat, Watsonville, Calif.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Ed. note: Antifa most certainly is bad. So is social isolation. So is the decline of the nation's spiritual health. So is the rise of negative partisanship. So is the dearth of local news coverage. There's so much that is bad in American public life these days. But what really saddens me are those who pretend Wednesday's ransacking was inevitable. Aside from excusing the conduct of the vandals and rioters, it suggests somehow that the case for America is hopeless. What a sad betrayal of the sacrifices made to provide the extraordinary opportunities we now enjoy. The doom caucus helped lead us here.

{"original": "Even if the partial government shutdown continues through February, those who require food assistance will still be able to receive benefits, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed.\\n\\nInitially, the Agriculture Department (USDA) said benefits would only extend through the end of January. But Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue unveiled a plan Monday to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) available through February.\\n\\nPerdue said USDA, in conjunction with the Trump administration, came up with a legally sound solution to keep SNAP benefits funded through February.\\n\\nOur motto here at USDA has been to 'Do Right and Feed Everyone.' With this solution, we've got the 'Feed Everyone' part handled. And I believe that the plan we've constructed takes care of the 'Do Right' part as well, he said in a statement.\\n\\nCAN TRUMP DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO BUILD BORDER WALL?\\n\\nAbout 42 million Americans benefited with the SNAP program in 2017, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). About 70 percent of those people are in households that include children; nearly one-third of beneficiaries live with seniors or adults with disabilities.\\n\\nPart of the plan includes issuing money to states for SNAP benefits earlier than usual and using funds provided from the expired continuing resolution, according to the USDA.\\n\\nPARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN COULD DELAY FOOD STAMP BENEFITS IF NOT RESOLVED SOON\\n\\nAside from SNAP benefits, school lunch programs will continue through February, USDA confirmed. WIC – which provides aid for pregnant women, new mothers and children – will also receive funding from the USDA.\\n\\nThe partial government shutdown has extended into a third week as President Trump and Democrats are seemingly at an impasse over funding for a border wall. Trump has demanded more than $5 billion to build the wall, an oft-repeated campaign promise.\\n\\nREPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN CALLS ON TRUMP TO USE 'OWN FUNDS' TO HELP PAY FOR BORDER WALL\\n\\nThe USDA is one of nine federal departments shuttered.\\n\\nWhile the SNAP program is automatically renewed, it still requires annual funding from Congress – thus initially leaving it in limbo should the partial government shutdown continue without a fix for SNAP into February.\\n\\nAside from those who depend on food assistance, the partial government shutdown has also hindered advocacy groups combating domestic and sexual violence. Many organizations nationwide that provide services such as shelter or counseling need to access grant money authorized through the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which was not extended when the government partially shuttered on Dec. 22 absent a funding deal."}

This means these labeled Tweets will not be able to be replied to, Retweeted, or liked, Twitter added, noting that they are also exploring other escalated enforcement actions and will keep the public updated with any significant developments.\\n\\nThis means that the account of @RealDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these tweets, Twitter posted. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.\\n\\nFuture violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account, Twitter said.\\n\\nFacebook, too, removed the president's video message, and locked his account for 24 hours, preventing him from posting to his Facebook page.\\n\\nWe've assessed two policy violations against President Trump's Page which will result in a 24-hour feature block, meaning he will lose the ability to post on the platform during that time, Facebook tweeted Wednesday night.\\n\\nIn the president's video, addressing supporters, he said: I know your pain, I know your hurt.\\n\\nWe had an election that was stolen from us, Trump said in the video taped from the White House. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.\\n\\nHe added: But you have to go home now. We have to have peace, we have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anyone hurt.\\n\\nThe president went on to say that it is a very tough period of time—there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us— from me, from you, from our country.\\n\\nThis was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people, Trump said. We have to have peace.\\n\\nTrump added: So go home, we love you, you're very special, you've seen what happens, you've seen the way others are treated that are so bad, so evil. I know how you feel.\\n\\nBut go home and go home in peace, he said.\\n\\nThe president, after posting the video, tweeted: These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long, Trump tweeted. Go home with love & peace.\\n\\nHe added: Remember this day forever!\\n\\nBoth the video and the tweet were flagged by Twitter and removed.\\n\\nBefore their removal, a Twitter spokesperson said: In line with our Civic Integrity Policy and recent guidance, we have placed a label on the Tweet, and have significantly restricting engagement with the Tweet due to the risk of violence.\\n\\nThe spokesperson added: This means this Tweet will not be able to be replied to, Retweeted, or liked.\\n\\nTwitter's initial flag on Trump's video message and tweet stated: This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can't be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.\\n\\nTRUMP SLAMS HIS VP, SAYS PENCE 'DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE' TO DECERTIFY ELECTION\\n\\nAnd Facebook Vice President Guy Rosen, upon the platform's removal of the video, initially said: This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video.

The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election. The company later removed the post altogether.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Instagram locked the president's account Wednesday night, according to a Twitter message from Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, before the unrest at the Capitol began, the president addressed his supporters at a pro-Trump rally, and railed against Big Tech and social media.\\n\\nTwitter's bad news, Trump said. They're all bad news. If you want to go through social media, Big Tech, if you're a Republican or have a big voice, they shadow ban you.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe added: And it should be illegal.\\n\\nThe president also said he has been telling these Republicans to get rid of Section 230.\\n\\nRepublicans have questioned whether social media giants should still be afforded liability protections under Section 230—a rule that shields social media companies from being held liable for content on their platforms, while allowing them to moderate that content."}

He was scheduled to work a game in Houston on Dec. 23, only to see the matchup called off when the Rockets didn't have enough people available to play in accordance with the league's health and safety protocols regarding the coronavirus.\\n\\nFrom there, Foster flew to Los Angeles. He worked four games in six days, and never left L.A. in that span.\\n\\nThat simply would have never happened in past years, when the policy typically was that officials would go at least 13 days between working games in the same city and six days between seeing the same team after reffing one of its games. Those rules will almost certainly come back when the world returns to normal, but for now, in the interest of safety — and common sense — teams are seeing referees more often than usual.\\n\\nIt changes things a little bit, Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer said. But obviously, for safety and our health and the health of the officials, it makes all the sense in the world.\\n\\nReferees are tested for COVID-19 daily, just like players and coaches, and have to comply with new league rules about avoiding bars, lounges, clubs, public gyms and many other indoor gathering spots. Reducing their air travel is another part of the league's plan to exist outside a bubble in a coronavirus-dominated world. The thinking is simple; less time in the air, less time around other people, less risk.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe Bucks saw David Guthrie and Marat Kogut on the crew that officiated their game at Miami on Dec. 29 and when Milwaukee returned to Miami a night later for the second half of the two-game set, Guthrie and Kogut were back as well. It's not an aberration this season; Ben Taylor was crew chief in Milwaukee on Friday and had the same role when the Bucks played their next game there Monday.\\n\\nThere are plenty of other examples.\\n\\nZach Zarba lives in New York and didn't have to get on a plane until his fourth game of the season, after opening in Brooklyn and then being crew chief for Knicks' home games on consecutive nights last week with Scott Wall working alongside him in both of those games.\\n\\nMarc Davis, Derrick Collins and Nate Green were the crew for the Dallas-Los Angeles Clippers game on Dec. 27, then stayed in L.A. to work Portland's game there against the Lakers the next night. Foster had the Lakers on Dec. 25 and Dec. 27, then the Clippers on Dec. 29 and Dec. 30.\\n\\nWe are working to keep our officials safe and reduce the amount of travel and potential exposure, said Monty McCutchen, the NBA senior vice president who oversees referee development and training.\\n\\nIt can lead to some awkward moments.\\n\\nConsider the case of Utah's Jordan Clarkson. He gave referee Karl Lane a bit of a shove — it didn't appear to be premediated or violent — in a game against the Clippers on Thursday, earning a technical foul. The next night, the Jazz were back on their home floor, with Lane part of the officiating crew again and after Clarkson got fined $25,000 for the shove.\\n\\nIf there were any hard feelings from the night before, none showed.\\n\\nClarkson got called for only one foul in the Friday game, a charge. Lane was the official who made that call, which in fairness was a pretty easy one. Nobody complained.\\n\\nGreat way to start to 2021 ! a team win and $25k lighter! Clarkson wrote on Instagram.\\n\\nThe NBA doesn't announce which referees are doing which games until 9 a.m. Eastern on game day, which means not many know beforehand which officials are coming to town. But now that it's clear that some refs are going to have extended stays in cities, at least for this season, Budenholzer says it could be time for coaches to perhaps be a bit nicer to those with the whistles.\\n\\nJust in case.\\n\\nMaybe as coaches, we can be more humane, Budenholzer said. If you know you're going to see that guy the next night, I don't know, you better be careful and know that he's probably sleeping on whatever it is you've said. So maybe some self-restraint, which is probably never a bad thing for coaches, is more in order considering we'll see these guys on multiple nights and more often."}

And he accomplished something else: He got House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, two of the least popular politicians in the nation, to respond to him -- on his terms.\\n\\nThe contrast should be glaring for anyone who watched. The president was really sober -- he genuinely believes that a wall is needed as part of a larger border security policy. That's what he won on. Democrats don't give a damn about securing the border. For them this is all about scoring political points and of course, 2020.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LAURA INGRAHAM\\n\\nDon't believe what they are telling you for even a millisecond. The Democrats are targeting the 800,000 government workers on furlough. They're targeting them.\\n\\nWhat do I mean?

Think of all the waste, fraud and abuse in this town that they could trim to come up with $5 billion.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL EPISODE\\n\\nThe president has shown a willingness to compromise. You heard it. In a funding request to the Senate Appropriations Committee this week,he asks for items important to Democrats, including, $800 million for humanitarian needs at the border, such as medical support and additional facilities to house migrants - which, frankly, a lot of Americans probably think would be better spent on inner-city youth and on our veterans.\\n\\nPresident Trump is also requesting $675 million for new technology to detect and stop the flow of illegal drugs over the border. Democrats have long said they wanted that. But Democrats don't want to have an honest conversation about border security. They are now the party of obstruction, and everything must bend to their resist Trump goals. The Hill reports that their latest strategy is to jam up the Senate by refusing to consider any legislation until the government is reopened.\\n\\nThe Democrats want this shutdown to go on as long as possible to divide as many Republicans from the president as they can. They want to peel off one after another and ratchet up the political pressure -- our safety and security be damned.\\n\\nJust to give you a sense of how dogmatic, rabid and fanatical the resistance to Trump has become, look no further than the Democrats who voted against considering a bill to support Israel on Tuesday.\\n\\nWhat? We're not going to oppose boycotts of Israel because Trump wants to do a deal on the border wall? How is that governing in a mature way? I'm sure the new anti-Semitic wing of the new Democratic party was thrilled about this development in the Senate. But most Americans are not.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\\n\\nDon't focus on what Democrats say. Watch what they do. The Democrats want this shutdown to go on as long as possible to divide as many Republicans from the president as they can. They want to peel off one after another and ratchet up the political pressure -- our safety and security be damned.\\n\\nIf they wanted the government reopened the Dems could negotiate with the president and reopen it tomorrow. He's already compromised on the structure of the wall and dropped his asking price. And while the Democrats feign concern over spending a few billion on a border wall - $5.7 billion - the Coastal Wonder Twins of their party, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Bill DeBlasio of New York, have all kinds of money — they'd spend pots of money - for the health care of illegal immigrants. They have no problem finding pots of money to spend on the well-being and health of illegal aliens.\\n\\nMy friends, like everything else, this is all about politics for the Democrats. Pretty much every demographic group is doing better now than they were a few years ago. The Democrats don't have any have no answer. They've completely given up trying to outdo Trump on raising the standard of living for Americans. So, all they have to run on is this shutdown and their opposition to his wall. Oh, and Trump's a racist. That's all they have.\\n\\nFor an added bonus, they believe this stalemate with the shutdown furnishes them with another political weapon to further their impeachment agenda. Trump's threat to end the shutdown by declaring a national emergency and building the wall himself could hasten the Democrats' ultimate desired end -- impeachment.\\n\\nThis kind of abuse of power opens up other measures, it could hit the trip wire of abuse of power which could lead to a presidential impeachment, said Washington Post political correspondent Karen Tumulty on MSNBC.\\n\\nWhile the Democrats strain to squeeze the last bit of political juice from this shutdown, the president is doing the right thing. He is focused on the security and the sovereignty of the American people and their prosperity. It is a posture that is good policy, but in time it's going to prove to be good politics as well.\\n\\nAdapted from Laura Ingraham's monologue from The Ingraham Angle on January 8, 2019."}

Andrew Cuomo took an early victory lap touting his response to the coronavirus pandemic with the release of his book last year, but as the nation faces another surge of cases, perhaps it was ill-timed.\\n\\nCuomo, a Democrat, raised eyebrows when he announced that he was already writing a memoir about how he handled the outbreak in New York. The book, titled American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic, was released in October.\\n\\nHowever, as The Blaze's Stu Burguiere pointed out on Tuesday, New York was hit with a major spike in coronavirus cases following the release of Cuomo's book.\\n\\nGOV.

{"original": "A string of newly resurfaced video clips of former national security adviser John Bolton spurred President Trump and his supporters Wednesday to highlight what they described as serious credibility questions -- raised by both Democrats and Republicans -- amid the Senate impeachment trial, as the president tweeted, GAME OVER!\\n\\nIn his tweet, Trump linked to an interview of Bolton in August 2019 where he discusses Ukraine policy. In the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty interview clip, Bolton made no mention of any illicit quid pro quo, and acknowledged, as Republicans have claimed, that combating corruption in Ukraine was a high priority for the Trump administration.\\n\\nBolton also called Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warm and cordial, without mentioning any misconduct. It seemingly contradicted reported assertions in Bolton's forthcoming book that Trump explicitly told him he wanted to tie military aid to Ukraine to an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. (Zelensky has said his communications with Trump involved no pressure for any investigation.)\\n\\nSeparately, Fox News has identified clips of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., now the lead House impeachment manager, in which he says Bolton had a distinct lack of credibility and was prone to conspiracy theories. This week, Schiff said Bolton needed to testify in the impeachment trial as an important and believable witness.\\n\\nThis is someone who's likely to exaggerate the dangerous impulses of the president toward belligerence, his proclivity to act without thinking, and his love of conspiracy theories, Schiff told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on March 22, 2018, when Trump named Bolton national security adviser.\\n\\nAnd I'll, you know, just add one data point to what you were talking about earlier, John Bolton once suggested on Fox News that the Russian hack of the DNC [Democratic National Committee] was a false flag operation that had been conducted by the Obama administration, he said. So, you add that kind of thinking to [former U.S. attorney] Joe diGenova and you have another big dose of unreality in the White House.\\n\\nSchiff made similar arguments back in May 2005, saying in an interview with CNN's Crossfire that Bolton was more focused on the next job than doing well at the last job when he was up for nomination as ambassador to the United Nations under then-President George W. Bush.\\n\\nAnd particularly given the history, where we've had the politicizing of intelligence over WMD [weapons of mass destruction], why we would pick someone who the very same issue has been raised repeatedly, and that is John Bolton's politicization of the intelligence he got on Cuba and other issues, why we would want someone with that lack of credibility, I can't understand, Schiff had said.\\n\\n'COUP HAS STARTED,' UKRAINE WHISTLEBLOWER'S ATTORNEY PROMISED IN 2017, VOWING TO IMPEACH AND 'GET RID OF' TRUMP\\n\\nThen-Sen. Barack Obama, in 2005, echoed those arguments, calling Bolton damaged goods whose appointment as ambassador means we will have less credibility and ironically be less equipped to reform the United Nations in the way that it needs to be reformed.\\n\\nObama separately had said that Bolton bullies, marginalizes and undermines those who do not agree with him. Other prominent Democrats agreed with him at the time.\\n\\nBolton himself had admitted in the past that he would be more than willing to lie if he felt it was in the nation's best interest.\\n\\nIf I had to say something I knew was false to protect American national security, I would do it, Bolton said in an interview with Fox Business in 2010.\\n\\nBut, speaking to CNN on Monday, Schiff took a different approach -- calling Bolton essential to the search for truth.\\n\\nI think for the senators, and I'm just not talking about the four that have been so much the focus of attention, for every senator, Democrat and Republican, I don't know how you can explain that you wanted a search for the truth in this trial and say you don't want to hear from a witness who had a direct conversation about the central allegation in the articles of impeachment, Schiff said on CNN's New Day.\\n\\nWHITE HOUSE TELLS BOLTON TO REMOVE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED MATERIALS FROM MANUSCRIPT, THROWING TESTIMONY INTO DOUBT\\n\\nSeemingly responding to charges of hypocrisy, Schiff remarked on the Senate floor late Wednesday: I'm no fan of John Bolton, but I like him a little more now than I used to.\\n\\nNevertheless, Democrats' sudden about-face has been drawing some light mockery from even left-of-center commentators.\\n\\nDemocrats are currently begging Mitt Romney to agree with them that John Bolton should swoop to the impeachment trial and save the day, but remember: you're a despicable Trump-loving apologist if you said ahead of time that this entire thing would be a joke, mused journalist Michael Tracey.\\n\\nWhether or not the Senate will vote to call Bolton as a witness -- or whether he will legally be able to testify -- remain open questions. Republicans have suggested that Schiff himself should testify over his inconsistent statements concerning his panel's contacts with the whistleblower at the center of the impeachment probe.\\n\\nAny witness resolution would likely require four Republican defections in the Senate, because in the event of a 50-50 tie, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts is highly likely to abstain rather than assert his debatable power to cast a tie-breaking vote. The witness question will be decided later this week, after the question-and-answer session of the trial wraps up.\\n\\nRepublicans, who have a 53-47 majority in the chamber, have suggested to Fox News that they would amend any witness resolution that subpoenas Bolton to also require the appearance of several additional witnesses favorable to the Trump administration -- likely killing support in the Senate for the whole witness package altogether.\\n\\nIn the meantime, concerns over Bolton potentially divulging classified information, as well as violating the legal principle of executive privilege, have emerged. On Wednesday, the White House revealed it had told Bolton not to publish his upcoming tell-all book about his time in the Trump administration until classified material is removed from the manuscript.\\n\\nGOP DEVELOPS IMPEACHMENT WITNESS 'PLAN B,' SOURCE SAYS\\n\\nUnder federal law and the nondisclosure agreements your client signed as a condition for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the deletion of this classified information, Ellen J. Knight, a National Security Council (NSC) aide, wrote in a letter to Bolton attorney Charles J. Cooper last week, which was obtained by Fox News.\\n\\nBolton's book has disrupted Trump's impeachment trial. The New York Times reported that Bolton's draft manuscript includes a claim that Trump explicitly linked a hold on military aid to Ukraine to an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden -- a central part of the case against Trump.\\n\\nThe letter from the NSC was transmitted to Bolton's attorney on Jan 23. The New York Times article about the manuscript came out on Sunday, Jan. 26 -- three days after the letter was transmitted. That indicates that the NSC had already made the determination that there was top secret information in Bolton's manuscript before anything became public.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, CNN reported that the letter amounted to a threat against Bolton. But sources told Fox News this was not a threat, saying the letter merely points out that there is top secret information contained in the manuscript that cannot be released to the public.\\n\\nBased on our preliminary review, the manuscript appears to contain significant amounts of classified information, Knight wrote to Bolton's attorney.\\n\\nThe letter goes on to say that the NSC is happy to work with Bolton to get the information into a form that can be published.\\n\\nThe manuscript remains under review in order for us to do our best to assist your client by identifying the classified information within the manuscript, while at the same time ensuring that publication does not harm the national security of the United States, Knight wrote.\\n\\nShe added: We will do our best to work with you to ensure your client's ability to tell his story in a manner that protects U.S. national security.\\n\\nBOLTON'S MANUSCRIPT LEAKS JUST AS MEMOIR PRE-ORDERS BEGIN ON AMAZON; WHITE HOUSE ACCUSES HIM OF TRYING TO SELL BOOKS\\n\\nBolton's book is titled The Room Where It Happened and is scheduled for release sometime in March. Suspicions have been raised about where the leak to The New York Times originated. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said Wednesday he is pretty confident the leak did not come from NSC. Meanwhile, Bolton, his publisher and book agents have denied coordination with The Times.\\n\\nIt has been in what's called pre-publication review, which is standard practice for any former government officials who held security clearances and publicly write or speak about their official work.\\n\\nAlso on Wednesday, New York Democratic Rep. Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, released a statement about a Sep. 23, 2019, phone call with Bolton.\\n\\nOn that call, Ambassador Bolton suggested to me -- unprompted -- that the committee look into the recall of [Ukraine] Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. He strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal as our top diplomat in [Kiev], Engel said.\\n\\nDemocrats have sought to connect the Trump administration's ouster of Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine to efforts to get the country to open certain investigations.\\n\\nEven as criticism of Bolton heats up on the GOP side, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally, has counseled his party against unloading on Bolton.\\n\\nIt is my opinion, based on the law and facts, that additional testimony is unnecessary in this case, Graham said in a statement. For the sake of argument, one could assume everything attributable to John Bolton is accurate and still the House case would fall well below the standards to remove a president from office.\\n\\nThat was the argument advanced by Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz in his primetime defense of the president during the impeachment trial on Monday.\\n\\nWATCH: DERSHOWITZ TURNS TO HOUSE DEMS, UNLOADS CONSTITUTIONAL ARGUMENT IN DRAMATIC MOMENT AT IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\\n\\nGraham continued: It is clear to me that there is ample evidence for the President to be concerned about conflicts of interest on behalf of Hunter Biden and that Vice President Joe Biden's failure to take appropriate action was unacceptable. This combination, in my view, undercut America's message on reforming corruption in Ukraine. There is a mountain of evidence to suggest the Bidens' behavior was harmful to the United States. The House managers' claim that the sole reason President Trump temporarily paused the aid was purely personal and political, not public, does not withstand scrutiny.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nNevertheless, Graham added, I am concerned when John Bolton's credibility is attacked, it makes it more likely some will feel the need to call him as a witness. In that event, it would be important for the President and his team to call witnesses on other issues.\\n\\nFox News' John Roberts and Chad Pergram contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Hunter Biden's attorneys fired back Monday after a private investigation firm again attempted to stage a highly unusual intervention in his ongoing child-custody dispute in Arkansas, this time claiming its investigators have lawfully obtained access to Biden's bank account records and confirmed his involvement in a massive, $156 million counterfeiting scheme.\\n\\nIn a motion to strike, Biden's legal team unconditionally denied the unverified claims, and called the effort by the Florida-based D&A Investigations another obviously bogus scheme by a non-party simply to make scandalous allegations in the pending suit to gain media attention without any material or pertinent material.\\n\\nD&A claimed in its most recent filing Dec. 27 with the court in Independence County, Ark., that it has provided attorneys for Lunden Alexis Roberts, who was seeking custody over the child she said Hunter Biden fathered, access to [Hunter Biden's] bank account records subject of known felonies including fraud and counterfeiting. D&A was seeking to be added as a party to the case, claiming it could support Roberts' accusations and prove that Biden was involved in illegal activity while dodging discovery quests.\\n\\nD&A alleged that the bank account records bear exhibit identifier(s) known by [Hunter Biden] as the subject of criminal investigation(s) both adjudicated and ongoing, of which he is a party to. The firm also claimed the bank records provide the source and destination bank account numbers of Burisma Holdings Limited, PrivatBank, Bank of China, [Hunter Biden's] business partners, Rosement Seneca Bohai, and others.\\n\\nSpeaking to Fox News late Monday, D&A claimed the FBI and Justice Department have been investigating PrivatBank, the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, Biden and others since April 2019 -- and that the investigation remained open. The FBI told Fox News on Tuesday that, as a matter of policy, it does not confirm or deny the existence of ongoing investigations.\\n\\nPRIVATE INVESTIGATION FIRM COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, SAYS BIDEN IS UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION\\n\\nThe bank records verify the counterfeiting scheme accumulating $156,073,944.24 with an average account value (monthly balance) in the amount of $6,785,823.66. Burisma, the filing claimed, financed Atlantic Council (Ukraine) and associated rogue operatives from the [U.S. State Department], FVEY, and CrowdStrike in Ukraine, suing PrivatBank.\\n\\nHunter Biden held a lucrative role on the board of Burisma while his father oversaw Ukraine policy as vice president, prompting even career State Department officials to flag a possible conflict of interest. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that Trump said possessed the Democratic National Committee (DNC) server that was hacked during the 2016 campaign -- a claim that fact-checkers repeatedly have said was wholly invented.\\n\\nBiden's attorneys did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment late Monday. But, the lawyers told the court that D&A's motion to intervene was riddled with falsehoods and clearly procedurally improper, and that Arkansas law required that intervening parties share some common issue with the existing case.\\n\\nD&A had not even attempted to explain how its latest filing complied with the law, Biden's team said, noting that the latest motion to intervene simply outlined a series of accusations with no legal or factual support.\\n\\nThe court has not yet ruled on Biden's latest motion to strike. Shortly after Biden's team filed, an individual in Jerusalem, Joel Caplan, submitted his own bizarre motion to intervene, saying he has lost money in the China hustle. Caplan, representing himself, wrote that his investments were basically robbed overseas -- then ended his motion by telling the court, Thank you for your time!\\n\\nD&A was the same firm that worked with the defense team of Casey Anthony, a Florida woman acquitted of murdering her child in a highly publicized trial in 2011. Anthony later accused the private investigator of smearing her for media attention.\\n\\nAnd, D&A's website is full of head-turning and unsubstantiated claims, including that CNN anchor Jake Tapper was a propaganda actor for Netflix. The website also called Democrats' impeachment efforts against Trump a sham.\\n\\nThe legal saga began last week. D&A asserted in a Dec. 23 Notice of Fraud and Counterfeiting and Production of Evidence filed with the Arkansas court that the 49-year-old Biden was the subject of multiple criminal probes and established bank and financial accounts with Morgan Stanley et al for Burisma for a money laundering scheme.\\n\\nTENSIONS FLARE ON CAPITOL HILL, AS GAETZ BRINGS UP HUNTER BIDEN'S ALLEGED CRACK PIPE EPISODE WITH RENTAL CAR, AND DEM BRINGS UP GAETZ'S DUI ARREST\\n\\nThe court quickly struck that filing, saying it had violated state procedural rules which required that intervening parties raise a claim that shared a question of law or fact in common with the existing case.\\n\\nThen, the firm told Fox News to expect another filing soon -- and asserted its investigators have found that the intelligence community whistleblower at the center of the Democrats' impeachment of President Trump accompanied Joe Biden when he traveled to Ukraine in early 2016 and, by his own admission, pressured the country's government to fire its top prosecutor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid.\\n\\nThe whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on D&A's claims, which Fox News has not independently verified. Zaid previously has acknowledged that the whistleblower had contact with presidential candidates of both parties, amid reports that he had a professional working relationship with one of the Democrats seeking the White House in 2020.\\n\\nZaid openly declared that a coup has started against the administration all the way back in 2017, and promised that impeachment would result.\\n\\nD&A's incendiary claims highlighted some unanswered questions that could arise in a possible GOP-led impeachment trial in the Senate. Most notably, after leaving the vice presidency, Joe Biden attended a conference at which he discussed a previously unreported meeting in Ukraine for the first time.\\n\\nI said, 'I'm telling you, you're not getting the billion dollars,' Biden boasted at the conference. I said, 'You're not getting the billion. I'm going to be leaving here in --,' I think it was about six hours. I looked at them and said, 'I'm leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.' Well, son of a b----. He got fired, and they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\\n\\nThe prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was fired in March 2016, and had widely been accused of corruption himself. However, publicly available records showed that Joe Biden did not officially travel to Ukraine in 2016.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in her filing in the case, the 28-year-old Roberts claimed Hunter Biden has had no involvement in the child's life since the child's birth, never interacted with the child, never parented the child, and could not identify the child out of a photo lineup.\\n\\nREAD LUNDEN ROBERTS' MOTION FOR CUSTODY, SAYING BIDEN HAS BEEN AN ABSENT FATHER\\n\\nDNA tests allegedly confirmed with scientific certainty that Hunter Biden was the biological father of Roberts' baby, according to court documents filed in November.\\n\\nJoe Biden tangled with a Fox News reporter when asked about that development.\\n\\nI'm wondering if you have a comment on this report, and court filing, out of Arkansas, that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather again, Fox News' Peter Doocy asked.\\n\\nNo, that's a private matter and I have no comment, Biden fired back before attacking the reporter.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOnly you would ask that, Biden said. You're a good man. You're a good man. Classy.\\n\\nHunter Biden reportedly is expecting a child with his wife Melissa Cohen Biden, whom he married this past May.\\n\\nFox News' Brian Flood contributed to this report."}
{"original": "This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, January 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\\n\\nLAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is The Ingraham Angle from a busy Washington tonight. Well, the news we made with the President on Friday night drove the news cycle all weekend and it didn't even stop today. Nancy Pelosi responded to President Trump. We're going to show you what she said before Congressman Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz are here to react.\\n\\nPlus, as the Speaker sends the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Alan Dershowitz and Gregg Jarrett are going to give you everything you need to know about what happens next. And I'm going to make a suggestion that Mitch McConnell must listen to and I mean must, I am going to tell you what that is. Just a few moments.\\n\\nAnd this is shocking, investigative journalist Lee Smith is going to tell us that he has evidence that the Obama administration sent notes to the now deceased terrorists Qasem Soleimani and he's here exclusively with those details. Wow. And my Can't Miss Angle on the state of the 2020 Democrat field, that's going to come a little later on in the show.\\n\\nBut first. last week was a big one for The Ingraham Angle. We not only had two news making interviews with the President and the Secretary of State, but we also shattered the liberal media narrative that Nancy Pelosi was some sort of political mastermind of strategy.\\n\\nThis entire impeachment gambit, it's just been an embarrassing failure from day one. So naturally, she's lashing out at Trump. Here's how she reacted when ABC's George Stephanopoulos showed her a clip from our interview.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC HOST: I want to show him on Friday night on Fox News.\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst speakers in the history of our country.\\n\\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I don't like to spend too much time on his crazy tweets because everything he says is a projection. When he calls somebody crazy, he knows that he is. Everything he says you can just translate it back to who he is.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Is Nancy in a schoolyard at this point?\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you aware that, I am rubber and you are glue and everything that you say to me bounces off me and sticks to you.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Here's the Speaker later on in that interview, sounding totally above board.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nPELOSI: Everything that he has done whether it is in Syria vis-a-vis the Turks, whether it's been in Ukraine in terms of withholding assistance as they try to fight the Russians. His denial about their role in our election then and now all roads lead to - and sometimes I wonder about Mitch McConnell to what's he - why is he an accomplice to all of that.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: That in and of itself tells you everything you need to know about the weakness of Pelosi's impeachment case.\\n\\nAnd by the way, I don't recall Pelosi getting all flabbergasted when Obama would not give lethal aid to Ukraine. And you don't hear talk about that at all. Suddenly, it's her number one issue. So, impeachment ploy didn't work, so they just go back to the old Russian narrative that failed on Mueller and it's failing now.\\n\\nJoining me now are two GOP Congressman Lee Zeldin, House Foreign Affairs Committee Member and Matt Gaetz, House Judiciary Committee Member. Congressman Zeldin, let's start with you. Why do you think the Democrats especially the Speaker, she's usually smarter than that? I mean I don't agree with her on a lot, but she's usually smarter than that. That was actually surprising even to me and I've been in this town longer than both of you probably combined, which is scary. But what do you think?\\n\\nREP. LEE ZELDIN, R-N.Y.: A lot of miscalculation. We saw it really since last fall, when they started this impeachment push and there was this rush, it was tripping over herself so desperate to rush, it's so urgent that we couldn't even provide fairness. We couldn't even provide due process to the President.\\n\\nAnd then starting 2020, starting an election year, she's coming out of the gate with a miscalculation with regard to these articles of impeachment and winning extra-long in order to send them over. A lot of miscalculations done by. I think it's going to be paid at the polls in November. And what she should be doing if she was smart, because she has all these Democrats in districts that Donald Trump won. She should be talking about delivering them wins to go back to their district, but instead all those Trump voters have to be fuming at these Democrats who represent, because they didn't send them to Washington to impeach the President--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: She have stuff to do. Let me say, we have a lot of stuff that needs to be done in this country. We have infrastructure that's crumbling. Go to any major airport compared to a lot of airports in Europe and Asia, it's ridiculous and they're messing around with these ridiculous investigations. Now, Gaetz, I want to show you what the media is saying. Some in the media are not even buying what Pelosi is now saying which tells you how desperate it is. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nRACHAEL BADE, WASHINGTON POST REPORTER: She's clearly putting a positive spin on what a lot of Democrats have privately said was a failed strategy. I mean she and Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader in the Senate set out to number one, try to get a commitment from McConnell on witnesses, firsthand witnesses to have them testify in a Senate trial. She also said she wanted to see a resolution about how the whole proceedings would be governed. She got neither of those.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: And she's contrary to some of the reporting, we'll get into that, she's not to going to get in either of those. So, that's a Washington Post reporter.\\n\\nREP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: This is a failed strategy and it's not that all roads lead back to Putin for President Trump. It's that all roads lead back to Russia for the Democrats in the absence of an agenda that actually works for the American people.\\n\\nTomorrow morning, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will huddle in their weekly caucus meeting and I expect it to be more tense than a family meeting at Buckingham Palace, because you've got these Democrats and Trump districts who feel like they've been walked off the cliff. They were told that this was imminent, this was urgent, this was a clear and present danger. And then even some of the more seasoned Democrats like Adam Smith, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee where I serve telling Nancy Pelosi, let's get on with it. This is starting to look ridiculous. Let's transmit the articles.\\n\\nBut it's my suspicion that that will ultimately lead to the least suspenseful trial in all of trials because we all know that the result will be the President being exonerated because he did nothing wrong in his call with President Zelensky.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Lee, this is hurting clearly, if this goes at any length of time. Even the last few weeks - the three or four weeks that this has been going on. This has to help Biden and hurt those who are going to have to stay in Washington during the Senate trial. So, a lot of people think Nancy in her own way is putting her finger on the scale against Warren, against Sanders and for Biden. Do you think there's anything to that?\\n\\nZELDIN: There is. I would also add for Biden, the one thing that would harm him is that a lot of the narrative of what this Ukraine calls about the investigations was this Biden family scheme in Ukraine with Hunter Biden being not qualified for this position. And I think that that is one thing that would come back and bite him and who knows, it may end up benefiting someone who isn't a senator or Biden, maybe somebody like a Mayor Pete ends up benefiting from it. We'll see how that ends up playing up.\\n\\nThe President has been focused on an agenda. He has a team. He's got Tony Sayegh, Pam Bondi, Patsy Baloney (ph). They've got great people to White House focus on impeachment. But the President himself is focused on an economy that is ripping right now. On the national security front, he takes out Qasem Soleimani and the Democrats are so invested into hating Trump that they can't root for the Iranians, the millions of Iranians who want to pursue a new direction and they're trying to make the President look bad, taking out Soleimani.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: But speaking of Biden, Congressman Gaetz, House Intel Chair Adam Schiff, your good buddy says that the Biden's together are really irrelevant. Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Do the Biden's have any relevant testimony? And I think the answer is that they don't. There has been no factual basis for these allegations against Joe Biden to ask the Senate, do these investigations that the President fraudulently sought to get Ukraine to conduct would merely turn the Senate trial on its head. Now that's something the President would love. But that's not a fair trial. That's a sham trial.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Listen to Joy Behar.\\n\\nGAETZ: Yes, boy. He's covering stuff up faster than a cat in a litter box. I mean when you look at the Biden behavior, it is exculpatory for the President. Think about it. If the Biden's are truly corrupt, it could never be an impeachable offense to investigate corruption or to ask our friends to investigate corruption pursuant to our treaties and so, we will put that evidence on if witnesses are allowed in this trial and we will I think be able to prove dispositively that this President as he has always done was putting the interests of the American people and the American taxpayer first. These were legitimate questions.\\n\\nAnd by the way, is there anyone who thinks that the Biden's just stopped at the Ukraine. They were running the same gambit in China and elsewhere because this is how corruption works. It's pervasive with these elements of permanent Washington.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: President has an obligation to safeguard the American people's money. And he was doing it in Ukraine. And that's one of the reasons why he was elected. It is great to see you both tonight. Thanks for both coming on.\\n\\nZELDIN: Good to see you.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: And speaking Pelosi by the way she's huddling with House Dems tomorrow to choose the impeachment managers as she prepares to send the articles to the Senate. THE INGRAHAM ANGLE was told to expect the articles to be transmitted on Wednesday. So, if that's what happens from here.\\n\\nJoining us now is Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus and author of Guilt by Accusation. Along with him is Greg Jarrett, Fox News Legal Analyst and author of Witch Hunt.\\n\\nAlan what happens - well, I was going to say it this way, the Articles of Impeachment arrive in the Senate. Couldn't and shouldn't, this goes back to my advice I'm going to give and I'm going to throw it out to you. Couldn't Mitch McConnell dispose of this travesty right off the bat? I think this even setting a precedent for these two articles of impeachment abuse the process and obstruction, obstruction for not going to court, abuse of process on these nebulous flawed grounds is ridiculous. I would either dismiss it or decide it immediately. I wouldn't entertain this nonsense at all. Thoughts.\\n\\nALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD PROFESSOR OF LAW EMERITUS: There's no question that these two articles of impeachment are unconstitutional. They do not satisfy the constitutionally required criteria for impeachment.\\n\\nPresident Trump's lawyers could make a motion to dismiss or one of the senators could make a motion to dismiss and take a vote right away. Whether they decide to do that or not will be up obviously to the members of the Senate, maybe to the Chief Justice initially. But I have absolutely no doubt that the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power which every president since Adams has been accused of, by their political opponents and obstruction of Congress, which is another way of saying, the President exercised separation of powers and checks and balances in an entirely proper way should never come to actual trial.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Right.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: Charging somebody with a non-crime and then the lawyer making a motion to dismiss which would be granted.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, the more I was thinking about this Gregg, and we would get into Romney in a second, but the more I was thinking about this tonight, get ready for the show. I thought, we have all this important stuff bearing down on us, let alone a presidential election in November. And Mitch McConnell is going to sit up there and entertain like motions and have this travesty play out. This thing has been held in the House for obvious reasons, a failed strategy or whatever. But this is a flawed constitutionally infirm two articles of impeachment and even entertaining this in a trial to me sets a terrible and dangerous precedent.\\n\\nGREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I agree with you. It lends legitimacy to illegitimate articles of impeachment. The second one is an utter joke. Obstruction of Congress for asserting a legal right to resist a subpoena. If Congress disagreed, their remedy is to go to federal court, it's always been that way. So that one should immediately be dismissed.\\n\\nThere was a motion to dismiss in the Clinton impeachment trial. It failed, because there were nearly a dozen felony offenses identified as abuse of power by the independent counsel Ken Starr. Here, there are no felony offenses. There are no high crimes and misdemeanors. They talked ad nauseum about extortion and bribery and in the end, they realized, there was no evidence for that. So, they conjured this wonderfully amorphous term, abuse of power. And you know I agree there ought to be and there probably will be a motion to dismiss and it should be seriously considered and voted upon.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: 51 votes is what you need. You've got to get Manchin, Joe Manchin and a couple of them more, middle of the road--\\n\\nJARRETT: Doug Jones, Alabama.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I'd go to Doug Jones and Joe Manchin said, you know this is ridiculous. We know this is ridiculous. This is terrible for the country. And Mitch McConnell has got it. I think there's too much messing around with this. I thought about this a lot tonight.\\n\\nAlan, Democrats lost their gambit to dictate the terms of impeachment clearly, and now they're essentially just smearing the Senate.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: Look, it hurts me as a liberal Democrat--\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senate allows the President to basically dictate how the Senate is going to conduct its trial. If the Senate becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the White House, then absolutely the Congress will no longer be an equal branch of government.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, so Alan that's basically what Bernie Sanders is saying too. And he's saying we should just ignore the Senate in some cases. This is what happens when you have a fraudulent impeachment proceeding at the outset. This is where it's gone.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 said the greatest danger is for impeachment to turn on how many votes one party can have against the other party. And that's exactly what happened. Look, it would be ideal if we had impeachments that were neutral, objective, bipartisan. That's what the framers had in mind. But this case doesn't rise to that level in any sense.\\n\\nAnd so, it was partisan in the House. They created the rules of engagement, making it partisan, rushing to judgment and then delaying judgment and suddenly they expect the Senate to ignore partisan affiliations. In an ideal world that would happen, but in the political world created--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Never.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: By the House of Representatives, it's unlikely to happen.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Gregg, here's what Romney said, Senator Romney from Utah said about having more witnesses testify.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. MITT ROMNEY, R-UTAH: There's the - if you will, the Clinton impeachment model, which is to say that we have opening arguments and then we have a vote on whether or not to have witnesses. That's the approach I favorite. And at that point I'll be voting in favor of considering witnesses. Clearly John Bolton. Yes. I mean he's someone who I would like to hear from.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I have no words for Mitt Romney. I supported him in 2012. I mean I like Mitt Romney. I have no words for him. OK. I'm just not in that.\\n\\nJARRETT: Romney belongs to the Romney party.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: What is this? What's in the water in Utah. That's my question. I love Utah, so don't send me emails. What about this, Gregg? There are reports that four Republicans now want more testimony.\\n\\nJARRETT: Well, we'll wait and see.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Is that a cause for concern?\\n\\nJARRETT: It is a cause for concern because they're essentially asking for the Senate to which is a jury to do the job of prosecutors in the House--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Factfinders.\\n\\nJARRETT: The prosecutors in the House had a chance to subpoena people like Bolton or Mick Mulvaney or Rudy Giuliani. They didn't do it. The one subpoena they issued, they withdrew and now all of a sudden, Nancy Pelosi is trying to engage in a quid pro quo to extort the Senate to do the job that the House was supposed to do. At the same time accusing the President of an impeachable quid pro quo. The hypocrisy and irony is, lost on no one.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: But nobody should forget that John Bolton doesn't get the last word as to whether he testifies. He may want to testify.\\n\\nJARRETT: That's right.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: But it's the President's decision whether to invoke executive privilege--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: He told me; he was going to invoke it. Yes, he told me on Friday. He told me that on Friday.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: Right. Then it goes to court and the courts will decide.\\n\\nJARRETT: And he has every right to invoke it.\\n\\nDERSHOWITZ: Hard to imagine anything more privileged than conversations about the national security between the President and his National Security Adviser in the Oval Office\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Well, apparently Mitt Romney doesn't think so and I don't know about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, but if they could put aside their dislike for some of what the President says or does for the Constitution and what's good for the country, they'd get thumbs up from me and a lot of other people. So, gentlemen, thanks so much.\\n\\nAnd coming up, did you all notice that former Obama administration officials last week rushing to defend Iran. Now, what might that be about? Investigative Reporter Lee Smith has uncovered shocking connections. We're going to bring him here next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: My Friday interview with President Trump didn't just drive the impeachment news, we also broke major news on the strike against Qasem Soleimani.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Did he have large scale attacks planned for other embassies?\\n\\nTRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the President said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. I shared that view.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The intelligence showed that they were looking at U.S. facilities throughout the region. The threat was imminent. I saw the intelligence.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Now, we brought up the fact that the former Obama administration officials were out in force defending the Iranians, yes, and attacking the President. The question is why?\\n\\nJoining me now is Lee Smith, investigative journalist, author of the Plot Against the President and Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.\\n\\nLee, you say there is a reason that the Obama officials seem very upset over the killing of Soleimani.\\n\\nLEE SMITH, AUTHOR, PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT: Qassem Soleimani was in many ways the cornerstone of the nuclear agreement that they made in July 2015. The Obama administration made that deal not with the imaginary moderates, but with the hardliners and no one was a harder man in that regime than Qassem Soleimani. He really was the cornerstone of the deal in many ways.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Victor, it is quite something is it not to hear this man described as some type of revered military figure like, he's just a scholar at Iran's version of the Hoover Institution, Victor, there you have it. And by any means necessary, must resist President Trump.\\n\\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I think they're embarrassed Laura, because it wasn't just appeasement but they had an actual tapestry of a new Middle East in which Iran would balance all of our traditional allies, Israel and the moderate Gulf regimes and we would give them cash and they would bank it, they would get more technological information in exchange for that. They would have peace for our time and John Kerry and Barack Obama could wave a paper and say, we've got an agreement.\\n\\nAnd what really happened was that infusion of cash and the cessation of those sanctions created a terrorist whirlwind from Iran into Lebanon, into Syria, into Yemen. And they're embarrassed about it, because this plan was bankrupt, it was crazy. And I think Secretary Pompeo and Trump realize that and yet they know that our real interests are in China with - in dealing with China and there's existential threat. So, they're sort of like sheriff's backing out of this Middle East saloon and saying, this place is a mess, but we're going to have a revolved result and restore deterrence. And that's hard to do.\\n\\nBut this was a policy by the Obama administration that was not accidental, and Lee is absolutely right.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I spoke to him.\\n\\nHANSON: And that's why they're embarrassed.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I spoke to this Iranian activists, incredible woman, Erica Kasraie about the media reaction here. And she says they are not telling the real story. Check it out.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nERICA KASRAIE, IRANIAN AMERICAN ACTIVIST: What I want the American people to know is that the majority of the Iranian people view Qassem Soleimani as a terrorist who has terrorized the entire region. They don't relate to the narrative that the Left has been giving.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, Lee, so shocking. It was shocking to see, and Pelosi spoke out about the protests that erupted on Sunday in Iran. After Iran admitted it shot down that airliner killing 176. And she said oh, they're just - they're upset because of the airline.\\n\\nSMITH: Right.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: That's all it is, it's this airline. They were fine before the airliner.\\n\\nSMITH: Well, it's worthwhile keeping in mind when you're looking at Democratic officials like Speaker Pelosi and when you're looking at the press, including the most prestigious brands in the media that these were - these constituted the Iran deal, echo chamber that helped sell Obama's deal with Iran. So, they have a lot at stake in protecting Obama's foreign policy legacy.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Now, before we get back to Victor, you said in this new piece of yours that the goal for the Obama administration was never to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. It was to stop them from building it during the Obama term. That's quite an accusation.\\n\\nSMITH: Well, I mean if you look at what happened - if you look at the sunset clauses meaning the different provisions built into the deal that were set to expire sometime after Barack Obama left the White House, that's very clear. It tells you what they were doing. They were passing it on to the next administration.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: It was like a hot potato except you're dealing with nuclear, nuclear potential.\\n\\nSMITH: Thank goodness--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Fallout.\\n\\nSMITH: They passed it on to Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton, as it turns out.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Victor, speaking of former Obama folks, your favorite Victor, John Kerry was on television tonight. Don't you know? Watch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the Iran front, could he Bumble himself into war?\\n\\nJOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes. Obviously, he could. I mean he almost did. It's a sad day when the United States of America has to rely on the decision of a regime that we neither like nor trust to have them be the ones who behave somehow in a way that saves Donald Trump from his own decision.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Just so everyone understands what he just said. John Kerry, former Secretary of State just said that Iran deserves credit for being restrained and reserved after that attack, attempted attack on our embassy, after everything they've done to kill American soldiers, build IEDs, the terrorism throughout the Gulf region. Our former Secretary of State just siding with Iran.\\n\\nHANSON: That's not the first time, Laura. Remember that during our discussions of getting out of the Iran deal, he was meeting in a shadow capacity in Paris with Iranian officials, in a way that would weaken our ability to protect our interests and get out of that flawed deal. And it's part of a larger narrative. They're really angry about the Soleimani death. But Donald Trump was very deliberate. He explained what happened. He didn't go to the White House Correspondents Dinner like Obama did and joke about predator assassination.\\n\\nHe didn't go on the campaign trail like Joe Biden. GM is alive, bin Laden is dead. He didn't cackle like Hillary Clinton when he said, we came, we saw, Gaddafi died. And so, it's been very serious, and I don't understand the schizophrenia that targeted assassinations are fine, we can joke about them and then - and the Logan Act exist here and there. But if there ever was a Logan Act, John Kerry has been violating it with his--\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Yes, shuttle diplomacy, when he's no longer Secretary of State. Lee and Victor, fascinating. Thank you so much both of you. And we were told that the Democrats 2020 candidates were a veritable field of dreams. How many times have we hear that old trope? What happened? Well, my ANGLE explains next and then Dinesh D'Souza responds, it's going to be a doozy. Stay there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: The field of shattered dreams, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.\\n\\nIt began with such promise, didn't it? In their desperate desire to oust our incumbent president, the Democrat party produced more than 20 candidates, from political rookies to seasoned pros. They came from Texas, New Jersey, California, and places in between, all claiming to have what it took to dispatch their ultimate political nemesis, Donald Trump.\\n\\nWell, in the Democrats' case, if you built it with these goofballs, the people will run. But it wasn't so much the candidates' talent or skill set that excited the resistance media that was covering all of this. It was what the field collectively represented.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Democratic field is obviously big. It's more diverse than many other years.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People really are excited about this field.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the most diverse field for a nomination ever.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a field that I think Democrats can be proud of.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: The d-word, diversity. This was supposedly, of course, the most racially, ethically, gender diverse field of candidates the country had ever seen, the world had ever seen. It was just what the left had been waiting for after four years of Donald Trump. Surely alone the fact of diversity would bring back disaffected Democrats and independents, and trump Trump's booming the company.\\n\\nOr maybe not. After months of uninspiring stump speeches and lackluster debate performances, it became pretty clear, didn't it, that most of the candidates were duds. And starting in December, the diverse field started to vanish faster than a Jamie Lee Curtis film. First Kamala, as in Harris, bowed out.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: Sorry.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nHARRIS: Right?\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Then Julian Castro.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJULIAN CASTRO, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Keep reaching for your dream, and keep fighting for what you believe in. Ganaremos un dia.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I love that stage shot.\\n\\nAnd today, we learned that Spartacus himself, it cannot be, Cory Booker, he's also calling it quits. Frankly, I was shocked, what with his high polling numbers of, I don't know, six percent? But let's not forget the Dems' latecomer candidate who had entered the race just seven weeks reinjecting the field with much-needed diversity and that common man's touch.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the point that they are making and a lot of people are making is you are a billionaire who is buying this election. What is your response to this?\\n\\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not buying anymore. I'm doing exactly the same thing they are doing, except that I'm using my own money.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Trump calls him Mini-Michael Bloomberg. I think major, though, is more appropriate, as in major waste of money. So what now, though? I guess a lot of fretting and awkward admissions, that's what.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of folks pointing out, #demssowhite. You've got another candidate of color dropping out of the race. Kamala Harris is gone, Julian Castro is gone, now Cory Booker is gone.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's going to be an overwhelmingly white debate, an all white debate.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How one of the most diverse fields in the history of the Democratic Party came down to white candidates at the top of it.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: So you live by the racial litmus test, you die by the racial litmus test. Instead of focusing on who the best candidate is, whatever color or gender, background, Democrats obsess on immutable characteristics. And they should never be the basis for promotions or jobs or political losses, not immutable characteristics, no. Ever heard of merit or experience or political talent?\\n\\nIt should also be noted that this stage of the 2016 election, at the same stage, the GOP actually itself had a more diverse field than the Democrats have now. They had an African-American candidate, Ben Carson, joining two Latino candidates, Cruz and Rubio. But remember, they are conservative, so they don't count in the Democrats' been counting.\\n\\nBut frankly, diversity is the least of the Democrats' worries, if you ask me. Their top three candidates, those old white folks, they are struggling to find a coherent message, and at this point are just at each other's throats. The Sanders campaign is reportedly telling volunteers manning the phone backs or knocking on doors to frame Warren as the candidate of the elites. When she heard this, Warren went on the warpath.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me. He knows who I am, where I come from. We all saw the impact of the factionalism in 2016, and we can't have a repeat of that.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Oh, but she's trying, because Warren has begun pitching her on backchannel stories to the media in an effort to hobble Bernie. Here is today's headline from CNN. Bernie Sanders told Elizabeth Warren in private 2018 meeting that a woman can't win, sources say. But just hours ago, Warren went on record saying it's true, and that Sanders, quote, disagreed during their meeting that a woman could win the nomination.\\n\\nAnd then there is the frontrunner, Joe, what state am I in, Biden. Other than remind everyone that he was Obama's vice president for either years, what exactly is he doing to excite the Democrat base? He is a human gaffe- omatic, pulled his string and some crazy nonsense will come out.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Corn-pop was a bad dude.\\n\\nPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\\n\\nMake sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night.\\n\\nThis is the United States of America. There is nothing we are uncapable of doing.\\n\\nThe kid used to come up and reach into the poll and rub my leg down so it was straight, and then watch the hair come back up again.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I just can't. Sometimes, though, through all of that, sometimes voters probably just forget which Biden is actually running.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's the only one who can beat Donald Trump in the November election, the only one. I know we have great Democrats, great Democrats running, great. Let them be secretaries of whatever.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Whatever.\\n\\nMeanwhile, President Trump is enjoying the show from the White House. It sure looked like he was having fun Friday during our interview.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders seeming to make some headway against Elizabeth Warren in some polls. What do you make of this? Is Bernie Sanders really --\\n\\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Could be. It could be. Joe can't string together a sentence. He's having a hard time. The other day a number of times he couldn't distinguish between Iran and Iraq.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: The uphill battle that these Democrats face is November isn't because they are not diverse enough. It's because they are not pragmatic enough. Free health care, free college, free preschool, frozen fossil fuel industry, open borders, higher taxes -- it is not going to grow the economy. It's not going to grow your 401(k), your bank account, or whatever, as Jill Biden would say. Empowering governments means taking away power from you. More power for the government means less freedom for you. By the way, it's the same government that thinks wasting millions on dead- end investigations and impeachment is more important than infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices. The 2020 Democrat field of dreams has turned into a mud pit, one that most voters just want to avoid.\\n\\nAnd that's THE ANGLE.\\n\\nJoining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author and filmmaker. Dinesh, did I miss anything about the Democrats' field of shattered dreams here?\\n\\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: I think you are quite right that they began with a diversity parade. You have two groups of people, the ones claiming to be diverse, Buttigieg, I'm gay, Cory Booker, I'm black, Kamala Harris, I'm black and a woman, so I'm a twofer. And then the other candidates like Elizabeth Warren and others, Beto, aspiring to be diverse, and pretending to be diverse in ways that they were not. So it was a diversity parade and a diversity charade.\\n\\nAnd then it all kind of imploded, and all these diverse candidates showed that they had lack of gravitas, they were downright silly, they fell away, and now you've got this kind of old white guys' parade that's left over.\\n\\nLook, the strongest candidate against Trump is going to be somebody who has to assure the country that they can keep the country safe, that they can protect a strong economy even while protecting the welfare state, a kind of pragmatic centrist, like you say. But they have driven those people out of the field, and they did it right at the beginning.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders, Dinesh, he says he's the guy. Check it out.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am the strongest candidate to beat Trump. To beat Trump, you are going to need a massive voter turnout. And the only way you do that is through a campaign of energy, of excitement. You've got to bring working people, you've got to bring young people into the political process.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: He's on the rise right now, Dinesh, and Warren is taking a hit or two, and Bernie is trying to capitalize on it.\\n\\nD'SOUZA: Part of the reason why Warren has plummeted, I think, is because there's a fakery to her. The insincerity of even her dance moves are just so nausea inducing.\\n\\nBernie, for all his craziness, is nevertheless authentic. In fact, this is one characteristic he shares with Trump. People who meet Trump, people who encounter Trump, say this guy is real, he's the real deal. He is what he is. Bernie is what he is. Now, I don't like what he is. I just read an article about how Bernie was thrown out of a commune because he didn't want to do any work. He wanted to talk about politics all day. The commune was all about self-sufficiency, growing your own food. So Bernie is making the case for being a bum, and there's a little bit of us that wants to do that. We don't want to get off the couch, we don't want to go to work. So there is a little bit of us that is Bernie, and I think that's the secret of Bernie's appeal.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: All right, Dinesh, speak for yourself, OK. There's not a lot of time to sit on the couch at my house, but that's actually a good point. If you get kicked out of the commune because you are too lazy, that is actually just not a good thing. Dinesh, appreciate it tonight. Thanks so much.\\n\\nAnd coming up, this isn't California or New York. There is an all-out gun grab going on in the home state of the NRA. This is a can't-miss debate. Run on the guns under Governor Blackface -- sorry, Northam. Stay there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nGOV. RALPH NORTHAM, D-VA.: We are not going to go door-to-door and confiscate individuals' weapons. We are going to pass common sense legislation that will keep guns out of dangerous hands and keep Virginia safer.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Governor Ralph Blackface Northam downplaying Democrats' plans to strip people of their Second Amendment rights. We've already seen this play out in California, New York, places like Massachusetts, Maryland, terrible on gun rights. Now you can add the Commonwealth of Virginia, perhaps, this list of states looking to, yes, take guns from the hands of law-abiding Americans.\\n\\nHere to debate is Jason Roberge, who is a veteran who is running for Congress in Virginia as a Republican. Along with me is Mark Levine, a Democrat Virginia state rep who is pushing many of these gun control measures. I want to add that Michael Bloomberg's group, he's running for president, 2020 tie in, has given 175k to the Democrat caucus in the Virginia state house to push these gun-grab initiatives. He's virulently anti Second Amendment. Jason, just how aggressive is this push going to be?\\n\\nJASON ROBERGE, R-VA. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Sure. So The Democrats basically just started their session in Virginia.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: They run both houses.\\n\\nROBERGE: They run both houses. They have the House of Delegates and the State Senate there. And they also, Governor Northam has the governorship. They are introducing as many bills as they can to limit our rights. They are trying to take away our firearms any way they can. They want to up the age restriction, the age minimum to get the --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: The most important thing about this, and we are going to get to Mark in a second, the most important thing people have to understand, an assault style weapon -- people hear that and they think, oh, my God, a machine gun. No. What is an assault-style weapon under the statute? As I'm reading the statute, it's any semiautomatic weapon that holds 10, correct, 10 in the clip, 10 or more in the clip? Most Sig Sauer, we have pictures of them, Sig Sauer 9-millimeter, Glock 9 millimeter, ARs, AK style weapon, the most popular hunting rifle in the United States is the AR-15, correct, depending on the size of the clip would be banned, those style guns?\\n\\nROBERGE: Yes. Basically any of these guns that hold a resealable clip or magazine. The way you can read the statute, it's very vague. And they are purposely doing this because they want to take away millions and millions of these guns.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Mark, is it true that these guns, however you want to define this assault style, and as a lawyer, the language, you could drive a truck through it, and they did it on purpose. But if this thing gets passed, there's no grandfather provision in the provision that most want, not grandfather provision, meaning you become a felon in the Commonwealth of Virginia if you have one of these weapons as a law-abiding citizen, yes or no?\\n\\nMARK LEVINE, D-VA. STATE REPRESENTATIVE: No. You are wrong. You need to read the bill. There is a grandfather clause.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: I have it. It didn't pass.\\n\\nLEVINE: You are allowed to keep your weapons. We're not taking people's guns away, and the list you gave is not an accurate list either. So no, I'm afraid you're misinformed.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: You define for our audience, OK, I challenge you to define what an assault-style weapon is under the statute's language.\\n\\nLEVINE: So it's very similar to what was under the federal assault weapons ban of 1994 to 2004. So it is having an extended magazine --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Ten.\\n\\nLEVINE: A weapon that fits an extended magazine.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Ten.\\n\\nLEVINE: More than 10 bullets.\\n\\nROBERGE: Why? How does that protect -- you're trying to protect the public, though.\\n\\nLEVINE: That's the same one that, by the way -- and to say it's against the Second Amendment, just to be clear, this has been consistently ruled by all the courts to be constitutional. First circuit, second circuit, third circuit, fourth circuit, D.C. So if you don't like it, you may not like it, but it is clearly within the Second Amendment. So let's just be clear about that. If you don't like it, go to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nROBERGE: How is it by limiting the number of bullets a gun can receive, how does that protect the public safety?\\n\\nLEVINE: That's a great question. Let me answer that question.\\n\\nROBERGE: OK, go ahead.\\n\\nLEVINE: So if you look at mass shooters, particularly look at what happened in Tucson, Gabby Giffords is alive today because the killer had to change the magazine. In Nashville, that brave men and the waffle house jumped on a person changing the magazine.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Let's talk about the church in Texas.\\n\\nLEVINE: When you have to change a magazine --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: This is a game we can play all day long.\\n\\nLEVINE: When you have to change a magazine --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Mark, stop grandstanding on my show. You can do it all day long. You can do it in a church where we have a person licensed to carry weapons as we had in Texas or Florida where people are allowed to carry a weapon that has an extended clip in it that's 10 or 12. And you can defend a lot of people getting killed with a clip that's 10 or more period. So the idea the government is going to tell you that you can't defend with a type of clip or magazine is obscene.\\n\\nLEVINE: Laura, if 12 people are coming to get, you are probably the bad guy. You do not need a 30-bullet magazine to hunt. If you can't shoot a deer in 10 bullets --\\n\\nINGRAHAM: We've got to go, but the government has no right to determine this, no right to do this. And they are not going to allow people to hold these guns.\\n\\nLEVINE: They do it in 10 states. Take it up with the U.S. Supreme Court.\\n\\nROBERGE: It's a straw argument. It's a straw argument. It's a terrible argument.\\n\\nINGRAHAM: We will. We will take it to the court. Jason and Mark, this is a hot topic. We've got to do an hour on this topic, it's so hot.\\n\\nComing up, we bid adieu to someone who gave us great joy. Stay there.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Tonight we remember our dear friend, Spartacus.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nSEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will be a president for all people in America.\\n\\nI will have a woman running mate.\\n\\nI see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.\\n\\nDonald Trump is a guy who, you understand, he hurts you. Even my testosterone sometimes makes me want to feel like punching him.\\n\\nI support Medicare for all, I support the Green New Deal.\\n\\nYou are dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor.\\n\\nI do not have a radical vegan agenda.\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What are the odds that we would see a wedding in the White House?\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOOKER: I got into Stanford because of a 4.0, 1,600, 4.0 yards per carry, 1,600 receiving yards.\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\nBOOKER: That might this be the headline coming out of this. Booker confesses that he is a Trekkie.\\n\\nHere's a bit of advice to everybody. You're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nINGRAHAM: Thanks to Samantha and Whitney for putting on that tearful goodbye.\\n\\nShannon Bream and the Fox New @ Night team, take it all from here.\\n\\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

{"original": "There is nothing more irresponsible than a boy on a videogame binge.\\n\\nThe call came in shortly after 6 a.m. Jason was refusing to get out of bed. So his mom called 9-1-1. Deputy Damion Whyte of the Harris County Sheriff's Office responded to the call.\\n\\nAre you serious? I later asked Mr. Whyte. You responded to a 9-1-1 call about a boy who wouldn't get out of bed?\\n\\nIS 'FORTNITE' MAKING ITS FINALE?\\n\\nIt's our policy to respond to every 9-1-1 call, regardless, Mr. Whyte told me.\\n\\nDeputy Whyte arrived at the home and went into the boy's bedroom. He told the boy to get up, get dressed, and go to school.\\n\\nThe boy refused. He said that he had been playing his video game until 3 a.m. He was tired. Not going to school today, he mumbled.\\n\\nSon, I'm not asking you to go to school, Deputy Whyte said. I'm telling you. Now quit wasting my time. Get out of bed and get dressed.\\n\\nThe boy obeyed. And Deputy Whyte drove the boy to the high school.\\n\\nWhen I speak to parents' groups about kids who are addicted to Fortnite and other video games, I tell them that it is the parents' job to limit, govern and guide their kids' use of video games -- to help their kids develop good habits instead of bad habits. One response I often hear from parents is, Shouldn't I give my son the freedom to make mistakes? It's not like he's going to be driving while intoxicated. It's just a video game. I think good parenting means letting kids decide.\\n\\nDoes good parenting mean letting kids decide? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. If your kid is invited to two different parties this Saturday, it's reasonable to let your kid decide which party to attend. But if your 12-year-old wants to drink a vodka tonic or two, just to see what it feels like, that's not such a great idea. Alcohol is toxic and can be addictive. The younger the child, the greater the risks. For 12-year-olds, the risks of drinking alcohol clearly outweigh the benefits.\\n\\nYou tell your kid: No vodka tonics for you.\\n\\nIs playing Fortnite more like being invited to a party or drinking vodka? There is growing evidence that online video games can be addictive. Fortnite may be the most addictive of them all. It is currently the most popular video game in the world, with more than 200 million active users.\\n\\nIf you've never played Fortnite, here's one way to understand the game: It's Minecraft meets The Hunger Games. You're on an island. Your job is to kill everybody else. You build defenses out of various materials, which you must acquire. You have to find weapons, and ammunition for those weapons, and use those weapons skillfully.\\n\\nAt the end of the game, there will be only one victor – or one victorious duo or squad, depending on your game mode. A round typically takes about 20 minutes from start to finish. The more you play, the more skillful you become. If you work hard enough, and put in enough hours, you will win. Eventually.\\n\\nEach game begins with 100 combatants. The first time Brett played, there were about 80 other combatants remaining when he was killed. After he put in another 20 hours at the game, he was killed with just 10 people remaining. After another 100 hours at the game, six weeks later, Brett achieved his first victory. He was the last man standing. There is nothing like getting that first W [win]. It's the greatest feeling in the world, Brett told me.\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has recently created a new diagnosis of Gaming Disorder in recognition of the growing number of people – mostly boys and young men – who have difficulty exerting control over the amount of time they spend playing video games, so much so that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities.\\n\\nIn a recent survey of American teens, 27 percent of teens admitted playing Fortnite in the classroom. That proportion is likely higher for boys than for girls. Boys and young men playing Fortnite outnumber girls and young women roughly two to one. Among devoted gamers – those playing more than 20 hours a week – the boy-to-girl ratio is even higher.\\n\\nCarol Ann Eastman was teaching freshman English in Summerville, South Carolina. A 14-year-old boy was was playing Fortnite on his phone. She asked him to put the phone away. He said Hold on, I'm right in the middle of a kill. Are you kidding me?\\n\\nDoes Fortnite take precedence over other activities in your son's life? Back in ancient times – say, 10 years ago – most boys would rather spend time with their girlfriends than killing imaginary enemies in a video game. Not any more. Adam White, who teaches high school in Nova Scotia, recently told me about a posse of 12th grade girls who complained that they had lost their boyfriends to Fortnite.\\n\\nIf your son is more interested in playing Fortnite than in spending time with his girl, that's a problem. If your son is more interested in scoring another kill than in joining the family for supper, that's not good. If your son is staying up past midnight trying to score a Fortnite W, it may be time to uninstall the game.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nBe brave. Do your job. Set limits. And if necessary, uninstall the game – which will also require that you deploy a parental monitoring app to prevent unauthorized reinstallation.\\n\\nOlivia Pelka banned Fortnite after she realized that the game was taking over her son's brain. She told me: After a couple of weeks Fortnite-free, I noticed my son was calmer, happier, slept better, and was not avoiding activities with friends and family as he was during his Fortnite life.\\n\\nDon't be intimidated. You can do this. It's your job. If you don't do it, who will?"}
{"original": "There is a new Congress here in Washington. But the government shutdown continues as before. The stalemate over border wall funding entered its third week. Each side is betting the other will give in first.\\n\\nNegotiations continued at the White House Friday. But apparently, they bore no fruit, because afterward, the president emerged to say the situation on our Southern border is so grave, he may be forced to build a wall without Congressional approval. Here's some of what was discussed when the president faced reporters:\\n\\nTERRY MORAN, ABC NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, JOURNALIST: Have you considered using emergency powers to grant yourself authorities to build this wall without Congressional approval? And, second, on Mexico--\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO WATCH THE FULL EPISODE OF TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\\n\\nDONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Yes, I have.\\n\\nMORAN: You have?\\n\\nTRUMP: Yes, I have.\\n\\nMORAN: How?\\n\\nTRUMP: And I can do it if I want.\\n\\nMORAN: So, you don't need Congressional approval to build the wall?\\n\\nTRUMP: No, we can use them -- absolutely. We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely. No, we can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it. But we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nWell, Democrats call that extremism. But who are the extremists here? Well, the ones who refuse to defend their country.\\n\\nThe new Speaker of the House has announced that the Democratic Congress will never, under any circumstances, allocate a single tax dollar to build the border wall, not because it's too expensive, obviously, these are the Democrats, but because a wall would violate some previously unknown and never-explained moral code.\\n\\nHere's what she said:\\n\\nSPEAKER PELOSI: The fact is--\\n\\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president wants to cut a deal.\\n\\nPELOSI: --a wall is an immorality.

But unfortunately, he has been unfairly demonized in much of the U.S. media and by the left.\\n\\nWe traveled to Egypt to see el-Sissi inaugurate the largest church in the Middle East on Sunday – a cathedral for the Coptic Orthodox Church – just outside Cairo. On the same day, the Egyptian president opened one of the region's largest mosques, emphasizing his efforts to encourage Muslims and Christians to live together in peace and harmony.\\n\\nEGYPT EL-SISSI INAUGURATES CATHEDRAL, MOSQUE IN NEW CAPITAL\\n\\nSome 10 to 15 million of Egypt's roughly 100 million people are Christians. Almost everyone else in the country is a Muslim.\\n\\n\\n\\nEl-Sissi deserves the friendship and support from the United States for his extraordinary efforts to fight violent extremism, protect religious freedom and promote peaceful coexistence between religious communities in Egypt and throughout the greater Middle East.\\n\\nThe Egyptian president's actions on each of these three fronts have been courageous, substantive and increasingly effective. The American people should understand that that where once a group of dangerous fanatics ruled Egypt, we now have a great friend and faithful ally in Egypt.\\n\\nPompeo made clear in his remarks at American University that he understands that radical Islamists – like the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS and the rulers of Iran – continue to support terrorism and promote enmity between religions.\\n\\nCriticizing the Obama administration, Pompeo said that in the past the United States grossly underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism, a debauched strain of the faith that seeks to upend every other form of worship or governance. ISIS drove to the outskirts of Baghdad as America hesitated. They raped and pillaged and murdered tens of thousands of innocents. They birthed a caliphate across Syria and Iraq and launched terror attacks that killed all across continents.\\n\\nEl-Sissi deserves the friendship and support from the United States for his extraordinary efforts to fight violent extremism, protect religious freedom and promote peaceful coexistence between religious communities in Egypt and throughout the greater Middle East.\\n\\nIn contrast, Pompeo said that the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region…. Under new leadership, America has confronted the ugly reality of radical Islamism. On President Trump's very first trip abroad to this region, he called on Muslim-majority nations to … 'meet history's great test – to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism.'\\n\\nAs the leader of the Arab world's most populous nation, el-Sissi is charting a path toward modernity and tolerance that is giving great hope to Egypt's religious minorities, which have too often been subject to discrimination and attacks by extremists.\\n\\nThe idea for building the Coptic Orthodox cathedral he opened on Sunday was actually el-Sissi's to begin with.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the so-called Arab Spring and the horrific terrorist attacks by Islamists targeting vulnerable Christian communities, the Egyptian president responded in 2015 by increasing security around Christian houses of worship.\\n\\nAnd el-Sissi did something of great symbolic importance that no other Egyptian leader had done before him – he attended a Christmas Eve service in Cairo alongside the Coptic Orthodox pope.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the Muslim Brotherhood extremists who briefly ran Egypt (and were in the process of running it into the ground) regularly issued religious decrees declaring it immoral for Muslims to even wish Christians a Merry Christmas. So it was a profound statement for el-Sissi – a pious Muslim – to stand with the Coptic Orthodox pope in solidarity as a fellow Egyptian.\\n\\nYet this was just the beginning. El-Sissi also promised when he came to power that his government would rebuild every single church damaged or destroyed by the extremists – a promise he has kept.\\n\\nJust stop and think about this: the most radical of the Islamists wanted to eradicate Christianity from the Middle East, something ISIS openly stated when its members notoriously beheaded 21 Egyptian Coptic Christians in Libya in 2015.\\n\\nEl-Sissi, in turn, responded to these threats by building the biggest church that anyone had ever seen in the region, and then giving it as a gift to the Christians of Egypt – and doing so the eve of Coptic Orthodox Christmas last weekend.\\n\\nThe inauguration of the Nativity of the Christ Cathedral was broadcast live on national television throughout Egypt. Standing at President el-Sissi's side were the Coptic Orthodox pope and the grand imam of the world's most iconic Islamic institution of higher learning, Al-Azhar University. We were fortunate to attend as hosts of a delegation of American evangelical leaders.\\n\\nMoments before the opening of the cathedral, the grand imam, standing alongside of the pope and the president, told the entire nation of Egypt on live television that Islamic law actually teaches that Christian and Jewish houses of worship should be given the same treatment as mosques. He then wished el-Sissi and the Coptic pope a Merry Christmas.\\n\\nIt reminded us of the words written many centuries ago in a document accepted as authoritative by nearly all the Muslims in the world, The Covenant Between the Prophet and the Christian World.\\n\\nThat document says that if Christians seek the help and assistance of Muslims in order to repair their churches or convents or to arrange matters pertaining to their affairs and religion, Muslims must help and support them.\\n\\nThe opening of the cathedral in Egypt is one of many such actions taken by the Egyptian president.\\n\\nConsider the fact that in the past 150 years only 2,500 churches were ever legally authorized to operate by the Egyptian government. Yet in the past 18 months alone, under a new church building law signed by el-Sissi, more than 500 new churches have been granted permits to operate.\\n\\nWhat's more, an additional 5,000 churches have been granted permission to lawfully hold worship services while they go through the permitting process.\\n\\nOur delegation this past week met at length with some three dozen senior Egyptian Christian leaders, Coptic and Protestant.

{"original": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration has yet to release reports that form the foundation of a study which concluded that the state's policies regarding elderly coronavirus patients did not markedly contribute to deaths at the senior care facilities.\\n\\nThe Times Union, an Albany-region publication, followed up with Cuomo's office last week seeking to view surveys filled out by nursing homes but was not granted permission. The publication said Cuomo's office pointed to exemptions in the state Freedom of Information Law that allow the records to be kept from the public eye.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the governor did not return Fox News' request for comment as to whether his office planned to release the documents and why it had not done so.\\n\\nThe controversial study, which was issued in July, found that a big factor in the senior care contagion was infection introduced by staff and visitors, since cases at the facilities were already spreading before infected patients were received.\\n\\nCuomo has taken flak for both the policy and the report, especially since his office never detailed how the report reached its determinations.\\n\\nNY BEGINNING TO SCHEDULE COVID-19 VACCINES FOR SENIORS, FIRST RESPONDERS THIS WEEK\\n\\nThe Times Union said it filed a Freedom of Information Act request for copies of the documents on the day the report was made public – though it has yet to see either completed surveys or blank ones to show what questions were asked.\\n\\nOn March 25, Cuomo issued the initial directive regarding nursing home patients. The idea was anticipatory, looking at a scenario where hospitals would get overwhelmed and be forced to discharge patients to go back to nursing homes.\\n\\nThe directive was reversed in May, when Cuomo said hospitals cannot send patients back to nursing homes unless they have tested negative.\\n\\nCuomo has said the original directive was in line with guidance from the Trump administration's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers from Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that went out to all states on how to control infections in nursing homes. The guidance said nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nSince as recently as September, Cuomo has been saying the state's nursing home deaths were not related to the order but instead the result of infections brought in by staff or family members before officials were even aware the virus was circulating in the state. And from there, community spread led to infections among the populations, which were particularly vulnerable to the virus.\\n\\nThe state only counts deaths that occurred in the nursing home facility itself, and not patients who were transferred to a hospital and then died, so critics argue the death toll is likely much higher.\\n\\nAs of late summer, there were 6,600 deaths that occurred on nursing home properties, as reported by the Associated Press."}
{"original": "A former head of British intelligence agency MI6 has warned that Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal with the European Union threatens British national security by placing control of British security in foreign hands.\\n\\nThe letter, written by former MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove and former defence chief Lord Guthrie, and obtained first by Sky News, claims May's controversial withdrawal agreement hurts NATO as well as our close bilateral defence and intelligence relationship with the USA and urges MPs to vote against the deal.\\n\\nBRITISH PM THERESA SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS\\n\\nThe first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens, the letter says. The Withdrawal Agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands.\\n\\nThe deal, which is expected to be defeated in Parliament next week when it is voted on, has split May's Conservative Party and sparked numerous resignations -- with Brexiteers unhappy that it would keep the U.K. in a customs union until a trade deal is forged. The so-called backstop to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, has led to fears that it would keep Britain in the E.U. permanently.\\n\\nFormer Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said in his resignation letter that it would give the E.U. a veto over our ability to exit.\\n\\nDearlove and Guthrie say that the deal threatens to change our national security policy by binding us into new sets of E.U.-controlled relationships. According to The Daily Telegraph, the letter also says that the deal is the exact opposition of the people's instruction to take back control when Brits voted in 2016 to leave the bloc.\\n\\nIn response, 10 Downing Street told Sky that the claim by the former chiefs is completely wrong.\\n\\nSPAIN AGREES TO BACK BREXIT DEAL AFTER SECURING CONCESSIONS FROM BRITAIN, EU\\n\\nThe letter is the latest blow to May's push to get her agreement through Parliament ahead of Britain's scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March. She has faced pressure from the pro-Brexit wing of her party to step down, but survived a vote of confidence from her own party last month.\\n\\nShould she lose the vote on the deal next week, as expected, May will likely face fresh pressure to resign and possibly another vote of confidence -- this time in Parliament. That could, in turn, lead to a general election. Those who have opposed Brexit have renewed calls for either a second referendum or a delay in Britain's departure.\\n\\nMay did receive a boost on Thursday from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said in a press conference alongside May that Japan supported her withdrawal agreement and that the whole world wanted to avoid a situation where the U.K. left the bloc with no trade deal.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMay told reporters that it was her deal, or no deal at all:\\n\\nThe only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table, the deal that is the deal that the E.U. has made clear is the only deal, she said, before calling it a good deal."}

We are live from Georgia International Plaza for the battle for\\n\\nthe Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo runoff races two days from now that will determine the balance of power\\n\\nin Washington. If both Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win,\\n\\ntheir party will control the House, the Senate, and the White House. If\\n\\neither Republican Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue is reelected, Mitch\\n\\nMcConnell would retain control and be able to block much of the Biden\\n\\nadministration's agenda. A record 3 million Georgians have already cast\\n\\ntheir votes in these crucial races.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeantime, President Trump continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy of\\n\\nGeorgia's election system after losing the state to Joe Biden. In a moment,\\n\\nwe'll speak with one of the Republican candidates, incumbent Senator Kelly\\n\\nLoeffler.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut first, to Peter Doocy in Savannah with the closing arguments on the\\n\\ncampaign trail -- Peter.\\n\\n\\n\\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, early voting data shows\\n\\nRepublicans will need a strong showing north of Atlanta, so that's where\\n\\nPresident Trump is going tomorrow and Democrats are going to try to run up\\n\\nthe score in Atlanta, so that's where Joe Biden is going, but first, a\\n\\nvisit by Kamala Harris here in Savannah.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nOSSOFF: But see, now Georgia has the opportunity to define the next\\n\\nchapter in American history.\\n\\n\\n\\nDOOCY (voice-over): Republican candidates agree, but for different\\n\\nreasons.\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: We're going to show America that Georgia is a red state, we're\\n\\ngoing to stop socialism and we're going to save this country.\\n\\n\\n\\nDOOCY: In one runoff, Republican Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Raphael\\n\\nWarnock.\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Dangerous, radical Raphael Warnock has not answered for\\n\\ninvestigations into child abuse, domestic abuse.\\n\\n\\n\\nDOOCY: Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.\\n\\n\\n\\nWARNOCK: Kelly Loeffler doesn't have a case to make for why she should be\\n\\nsitting in that seat.\\n\\n\\n\\nDOOCY: And the other runoff, the Republican David Perdue, is quarantining\\n\\nafter her close contact with a COVID-19-infected staffer but still accusing\\n\\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff of hiding transactions with a business linked to China.\\n\\n\\n\\nPERDUE: This is a ripening scandal, as we now know. He -- he is involved\\n\\nwith the communist Chinese party during his primary.\\n\\n\\n\\nDOOCY: Ossoff claims David Perdue is the corrupt one.\\n\\n\\n\\nOSSOFF: We have two United States senators who, when they learned about\\n\\nthe threat that COVID-19 posed to their own constituents, their first call\\n\\nwas to their broker.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\n\\n\\nDOOCY (on camera): Campaigns are trying hard to stick with people that\\n\\nthey come across. For example, yesterday at a campus launch, organizers\\n\\nsent volunteers away with this chant. Door knock for Warnock, vote your\\n\\nOss-off -- Bret.\\n\\n\\n\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: All right. Peter Doocy reporting from Savannah -- Peter, thanks.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoining me here now, Senator Kelly Loeffler.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood morning, Senator. Welcome to FOX News Sunday.\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): Good morning. Great to be with you, Bret.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: We should point out. We invited your opponent, Raphael Warnock, on\\n\\nas well. He declined.\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for being here.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's a little cold for Atlanta.\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: That's okay, it's going to warm up.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Yeah, that's right.\\n\\n\\n\\nSenator, you've been all over the state since November 3rd. And, you -- we\\n\\nare now two days from this runoff. As we mentioned, more than 3 million\\n\\nGeorgians have already voted.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere did you and your team see this race right now?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Bret, Georgians are fired up. They are ready to get\\n\\nout and vote on Tuesday because they know the future of the country is on\\n\\nthe ballot here in Georgia. It's a choice. It's a stark contrast between\\n\\nthe freedoms, our way of life here in Georgia, or socialism, government\\n\\ncontrol.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going\\n\\nto take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is\\n\\nnot just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run\\n\\nhealth care. But he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of\\n\\nchange.\\n\\n\\n\\nRadical liberal Raphael Warnock is my opponent. He is someone that would\\n\\nfundamentally change this country. His values are out of step with Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: We are going to talk about that in a minute.\\n\\n\\n\\nAre you worried about Republican turnout because of the current ongoing\\n\\nchallenge to the election?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Republicans, Democrats, everyone, they need to know\\n\\nthat we can trust this process that we are working hard to make sure that\\n\\nthis is a fair, trusted election. We have 8,000 poll watchers.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut from what I've seen as I've crisscrossed the state nonstop over the\\n\\nlast nine weeks, Georgians are fired up to vote and we've seen that in\\n\\nearly voting. Three million votes shattering records for previous runoffs\\n\\nand we know that on Tuesday, just two days away here, we are going to see a\\n\\nrecord turnout for this runoff election and I'm confident that we will win\\n\\nif our voters turnout.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: This weekend, Senator Ted Cruz campaigned for you. He and ten other\\n\\nRepublican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator Josh\\n\\nHawley in a vote against certifying Electoral College votes if there isn't\\n\\nan audit of disputed states votes, including this one. Now, you are not on\\n\\nthat list.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy not?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, I've said from the start, everything is on the table here,\\n\\nand I'm seriously looking at that. We have to make sure that Georgia and\\n\\nall of Americans trust our voting process. But my number one objective\\n\\nright now has to be winning on January 5th so that we can get to the bottom\\n\\nof what happened in these elections.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe know that Democrats will never get to the bottom of it. That's what\\n\\nwe're fighting here for, and I'm continuing to fight for this president.\\n\\nHe's fought for us and so we're going to stay on top of that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: So, the president says this election was stolen. In fact, he\\n\\ntweeted this weekend that because of how the process was done here in\\n\\nGeorgia, the election, including the Senate run, was, quote, illegal and\\n\\ninvalid.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you agree with that?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, the president has been very consistent. He came down\\n\\nto Georgia in December and said you have to get out and vote for David\\n\\nPerdue and Kelly Loeffler. You have to exercise your right to vote.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe's coming back here tomorrow night, to Dalton, Georgia, and he's going to\\n\\ntell voters the same thing, you have to get out and vote, Georgia, because\\n\\nthis is too important. The country is on the line. They are counting on us.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe won't get a second chance. If we lose this election, we could lose the\\n\\nfuture of the country because we know Chuck Schumer wants to abolish the\\n\\nfilibuster, get rid of the Electoral College, have D.C. statehood, raise\\n\\nour taxes, and the list goes on.\\n\\n\\n\\nGeorgians -- that's out of step with Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: But I guess -- and I know you're focused on January 5th, but\\n\\nJanuary 6th, you have to make that decision. And so, today, can you say\\n\\nwhether you will certify the Electoral College votes or not, maybe\\n\\nspecifically from Georgia?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, I'm looking very, very closely at it, and I've been one of\\n\\nthe first to say, everything is on the table. I'm fighting for this\\n\\npresident because he's fought for us. He's our president and we are going\\n\\nto keep making sure that this is a fair election and I'm looking very\\n\\nclosely at it. But again, none of it matters if I can't win on January 5th.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Right. Well, some of your other Republican colleagues have called\\n\\nthese overturned election efforts bad for your party, bad for the country.\\n\\nSenators Romney, Toomey have talked out about it. Senator Toomey releasing\\n\\na statement about the senator's efforts, Senators Cruz and Hawley.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey failed to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in\\n\\ncourtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence. I\\n\\nacknowledge that this past election, like all elections, had\\n\\nirregularities, but the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this\\n\\nelection.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs he right?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, we have every right to take these votes in a way\\n\\nthat we believe reflects our constituency and our state, and that's what\\n\\nI'm going to do. I'm going to speak for the people of Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut the worst thing for a party is if David Perdue and I don't win on\\n\\nTuesday. We have to win because we have to be able to get to that next\\n\\nstep, to be able to vote our conscience and what is right on January 6th,\\n\\nand then we have to be able to pursue holding people accountable for how\\n\\nthese elections were handled.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: But have you seen evidence, enough evidence of fraud to overturn\\n\\nany state's election, as a senator and what you've seen so far?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, certainly, here in Georgia, we have upwards of 200 open\\n\\ninvestigations. We're in the courts right now. We have heard and seen too\\n\\nmuch. We need to get to the bottom of it.\\n\\n\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: And, Senator, you know there have been 60-plus court cases that\\n\\nhave been -- gone before judges, some of them Trump-appointed judges, where\\n\\nthey haven't found that evidence.\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, these cases haven't been heard. They deserve to be heard.\\n\\nWe need to make sure that we get to the bottom of this because the\\n\\nintegrity of voting is at the core of our democracy. We have to protect\\n\\nthat. We have to have people who are willing to fight for it and defend it,\\n\\nand that's what I'm looking at right now.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a big decision for the 6th, but I have to stay laser focused on the\\n\\n5th because if we don't win the 5fth, we will lose the country.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Let's talk about this race, specifically our opponent. On the\\n\\ncampaign trail when he's pressed about anything that he's -- you know\\n\\nyou're charging him with, he comes back with pretty much the same attack on\\n\\nyou. It's very consistent. Take a listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nRAPHALE WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: When she heard about the\\n\\ncoronavirus pandemic, she got busy making sure that she protected her own\\n\\nwealth. She is the wealthiest member of Congress. She dumped $3 million\\n\\nworth of stock, meanwhile telling you there was nothing to worry about.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: All right, so your response to that? The direct charge that he says\\n\\nover and over again on the trail?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, this is a political attack that has been completely\\n\\ndebunked. It's a left-wing media attack, totally debunked and it's a lie.\\n\\nThe mainstream media continued to carry it and now they've been embarrassed\\n\\nbecause it's completely debunked.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: So it didn't happen?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Absolutely not, and I've proven that over and over. And, look,\\n\\nthis is a distraction. This is -- the Democrats don't want to answer for\\n\\ntheir radical policies to change America.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe radical agenda of Raphael Warnock and his own -- his own facts are that\\n\\nhe's been involved in a child abuse investigation that he obstructed. He\\n\\nwas arrested for obstructing it. He's been involved in a domestic abuse. He\\n\\nwon't answer those questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's what the mainstream media has refused to focus on. That's why I'm\\n\\nhaving to raise those types of questions and why has he refused to denounce\\n\\nMarxism and socialism? He refused to do that in our debate. He's attacked\\n\\nour police officers, calling them gangsters, thugs, and bullies.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe said that you can't serve God and the military. He's praised Fidel\\n\\nCastro, Karl Marx. And Georgians need to know who he is, because he is out\\n\\nof step with Georgia's values.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: A lot of people look at this race and think President Trump may\\n\\nhave put you in Senator Perdue in a box first when he threatened to not\\n\\nsign the COVID stimulus and government funding and then he signed it. Then\\n\\nby after that demanding or calling for additional direct payments, which he\\n\\nthen supported, and then by vetoing the national defense bill, which you\\n\\noriginally supported and voted for.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy didn't you vote on the veto override Friday in the Senate?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I stood with the president 100 percent of the time.\\n\\nHe's putting America first. He's fought for our men and women in the\\n\\nmilitary. He restored our strength in our Department of Defense and our\\n\\nnational security.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, look, I have to be out across the state campaigning to make sure that\\n\\nGeorgians turn out and vote on January 5th because none of this will matter\\n\\nif we don't win on the 5th.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook, Chuck Schumer has said is going to defund our military by 25 percent.\\n\\nRaphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, they would be rubber-stamps for defunding the\\n\\nmilitary, the police, raising taxes, ushering in government-run health\\n\\ncare, weakening our Second Amendment rights, opposing or religious freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's all on the ballot here in Georgia, January 5th. That's what I'm\\n\\nfighting for, is to preserve the future of our country.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Understanding the campaigning is important, if you're saying how\\n\\nimportant this election is on January 5th, but obviously, Georgia is a big\\n\\ndefense state, current and former military here, defense business here.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow would you have voted had you voted on that veto override?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I voted to support the NDAA. The bill that came out\\n\\nof conference was very different from what we've been promised. So, I don't\\n\\nknow. I was here in Georgia working across the state and I will continue to\\n\\nstand with our men and women in the military.\\n\\n\\n\\nRaphael Warnock will not stand for our military. He's attacked them. He\\n\\nsaid you can't serve God and serve in the military.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Right, but you would have sustained the veto, the president's veto\\n\\non the NDAA?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Look, what's at stake here is our military and our freedoms.\\n\\nThose are what's on the ballot right now.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'm the daughter and granddaughter of veterans. We're the fifth largest\\n\\nstate for veterans and active-duty military here in Georgia. I have fought\\n\\nfor our military and made sure that we get the funding we need and we are\\n\\ngoing to continue to do that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut if we don't win on January 5th, our military will be defunded and\\n\\nworse.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: I won't belabor it but that's not a yes or no whether you would\\n\\nsustain the veto or not.\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: That's right.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: OK, you're not answering that.\\n\\n\\n\\nListen, Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, has said voters\\n\\nin this runoff should not be scared that Chuck Schumer will get unlimited\\n\\npower because Manchin, according to him and maybe others, will not vote to\\n\\nkill the filibuster.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you say to Senator Manchin and others who are saying that?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, we know what Chuck Schumer said. He's going to take\\n\\nGeorgia and change America. He's told us exactly what he's going to do.\\n\\nHe's going to make D.C. a state, would have to go Democrat senators, it\\n\\nwould be impossible for Republicans to win the majority again, he would\\n\\nabolish the filibuster and the Electoral College. He'd structurally change\\n\\nthis country, pack the Supreme Court.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, refused to answer questions\\n\\nabout court packing because we know that he would pack the court with\\n\\nliberal justices. So it would overturn the Constitution and the rule of\\n\\nlaw. It would eliminate our religious freedom, free speech, everything\\n\\nthat's under attack right now by the left.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo we know what's at stake here in Georgia. If we lose this election, we\\n\\nwon't get a second chance.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Senator, as a senator, you deal with a lot of different things.\\n\\nThis is an issue that's today. Today is the one-year anniversary of the\\n\\nU.S. killing Iran's most powerful general, the head of Iran's militias\\n\\ninside Iraq. It appears according to intelligence that Iran proxy forces\\n\\nare preparing to carry out more attacks on Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat should the response be if that happens?\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I have stood with this president, the decisions he's\\n\\nmade to keep America safe, have done that. He's led peace deals for the\\n\\nfirst time in decades. He stood with Israel, stood against the dangerous\\n\\nJCPOA, the Iran deal, that shipped pallets of cash to Iran.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo we have to continue to be tough, secure our national defense. That's our\\n\\nfocus and Americans have seen that. We have been kept safe, thanks to this\\n\\npresident, and I'll continue to support his actions there.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: And again, the president in North Georgia tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n\\nSenator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank you\\n\\nvery much for your time.\\n\\n\\n\\nLOEFFLER: Thank you, Bret.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Well, we will have complete coverage Tuesday night.\\n\\n\\n\\nUp next, we'll bring in the Sunday panel to discuss what's at stake in\\n\\nthese runoffs.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlus, as we mentioned, a growing number of Trump allies signing on to\\n\\ncontest the election results -- as FOX News Sunday continues from the\\n\\nGeorgia International Plaza in downtown Atlanta.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): You've got 74 million people that feel that, A,\\n\\nmany of them feel they've been disenfranchised, they feel they've not been\\n\\nheard, and January 6th is the only opportunity that I've got to speak up\\n\\nfor my constituents in this process.\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): This is just grossly responsible by Senator\\n\\nHawley, going and undermining even more about public confidence in our\\n\\ndemocratic process.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Republican Senator Josh Hawley on his plans to object to\\n\\ncertification of the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on Wednesday and\\n\\nthen Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen's slamming those plans.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason\\n\\nChaffetz. Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for The Wall Street\\n\\nJournal, and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams.\\n\\n\\n\\nJason, let me start with you. This is the joint statement from these GOP\\n\\nsenators and senators-elect. It says Congress should immediately point and\\n\\nelectoral commission with full investigatory and fact-finding authority to\\n\\nconduct an emergency ten-day audit of the election returns in the disputed\\n\\nstates. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission\\n\\n'his findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a\\n\\nchange in their vote if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\nYour thoughts on this move?\\n\\n\\n\\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, if they're going to ask\\n\\nCongress whether or not they're going to certify the results, there's no\\n\\nreason why members can't go out and express their own personal views on it.\\n\\nThat's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates and\\n\\nI think there are a lot of people in both the Senate and in the House who\\n\\nare concerned about it.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, I think it's a futile attempt. I don't think it's going to pass, but I\\n\\ndon't think we should be afraid of the debate in the discussion, because\\n\\nthere are anomalies and there are things that need to be investigated and\\n\\nlooked at. And I have respect what these senators and members in the House\\n\\nare doing.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Yeah, Juan, you know, you heard Senator Loeffler not really answer\\n\\nwhat side she'll be on as far as that vote comes down. But obviously,\\n\\nAttorney General Bill Barr before he left his position said he did not see\\n\\nenough widespread fraud to overturn any vote in any state. But the pressure\\n\\nis still on Trump allies.\\n\\n\\n\\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Look, let's just take the\\n\\nvarnish off this, Bret. This is an effort to overturn an election and as\\n\\nsuch, it is doing tremendous damage to democracy. Senator Pat Toomey, the\\n\\nRepublican of Pennsylvania, said the essence of democracy is the people\\n\\nchoosing their leaders and this is an effort to undermine the people's\\n\\nright to choose their leadership, and they elected Joe Biden.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is, to me, and effort that really comes down -- you know, it's\\n\\nshocking. You know, Jason Chaffetz says let's put the evidence out there.\\n\\nWhy not let people express their opinions and investigate? Well, as you\\n\\npointed out in your interview with Senator Loeffler, 60 courts, more than\\n\\n90 judges, many of them Trump-appointed judges, have looked at this and\\n\\nfound that there is no basis for, in fact, challenging any of these\\n\\nelection results no matter what small anomalies or irregularities might\\n\\nhave existed.\\n\\n\\n\\nNothing that would change the results of the election, but it does\\n\\nundermine the incoming Biden administration and it does do damage to the\\n\\ncredibility of our democracy. This is very serious business. If the\\n\\nDemocrats were doing this, the Republicans would yell treason.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Catherine, thoughts on this and the politics of this?\\n\\n\\n\\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, Bret. I think you're\\n\\nabsolutely right that for a lot of senators, this really has -- and House\\n\\nmembers -- this has become a political moment as much as anything else.\\n\\nWhat we are hearing from sources on the Hill is that a lot of these members\\n\\nare feeling tremendous pressure from their districts, from their\\n\\nconstituents, from local elected officials that they need to be, you know,\\n\\ntaking a stand and defending the president and we know the president has\\n\\nbeen very vocal about his frustration with the outcome, about wanting\\n\\npeople to challenge it publicly, his frustration with the outcomes in the\\n\\ncourts.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so, they are feeling like they need to -- and this is -- this is sort\\n\\nof turning into a litmus test for your defense for the president and you're\\n\\nseeing people make calculations around their midterm elections if they are\\n\\nup then and well as people who are looking ahead to potential runs in 2024\\n\\nand how this might play for them then.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Jason, you said it's going to be futile and, you know, the votes\\n\\neventually, they could have a long debate on the floor, but January 6th\\n\\neventually is going to lead to inauguration on January 20th. As it's\\n\\nwritten right now, the president doesn't seem to be tweeting that.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: Well, again, I do believe it's futile. I don't think it will go\\n\\nthere, but I think the nation, having a debate -- because there are\\n\\nmillions of people who do not believe that the process ultimately was fair\\n\\nand honorable in the way it was discharged, and so why can't they express\\n\\nthat? Why can't we have that debate in this country?\\n\\n\\n\\nI don't like the idea that they want to just shut down the debate and say,\\n\\nyou know, just go exactly the way you're supposed to go. It's okay for us\\n\\nas a nation for a few hours to have this debate. Ultimately I don't think\\n\\nit will pass.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Well -- here's what Senators Romney and Toomey and others are\\n\\nsaying and you just heard it from Juan, is that the way to debate this is\\n\\nin court and the Trump campaign tried in more than 60 courts to do this and\\n\\nthe substance of it even in front of Trump judges never lead to any one\\n\\njudge saying there was enough evidence to overturn that state's votes.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: But there is a reason why -- this question goes before Congress\\n\\nand that's part of the -- this is what's amazing about the United States of\\n\\nAmerica. It's what separates him from all the other nations on the Earth.\\n\\nThey actually posed this question to Congress.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so, each member gets to vote how they want to vote and if they want to\\n\\nobject, they can object. That's how we do things in this country. It's not\\n\\njust the courts that decide this. Congress has a role in this as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: All right. So, Juan, for Trump supporter's who say, listen, we do\\n\\nthink that there is something fishy here, how politically are Republicans\\n\\ngoing to keep all of them ahead of this Georgia runoff on the 5th and to\\n\\ncome out and vote and what they consider really a crucial moment for the\\n\\nparty?\\n\\n\\n\\nWILLIAMS: I guess it's just got to be loyalty to President Trump at this\\n\\njuncture and it's ironic that the president over the weekend as you\\n\\nmentioned earlier has said he considers this election illegal and invalid.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, if that's the case, why bother to vote? Why support, you know, sort\\n\\nof an extra-legal corrupt exercise? Why would anybody go out and vote? I\\n\\ndon't get it.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he's going there tomorrow to campaign and I guess you just have to say\\n\\nas we heard in your interview with Senator Loeffler, she is just loyal to\\n\\nPresident Trump. She doesn't have her own agenda. She didn't lay out any\\n\\nagenda with regard to any issue. Back and forth with regard to the stimulus\\n\\nspending, not willing to answer with regard to supporting the president's\\n\\nveto of the defense appropriation, which was overridden by her fellow\\n\\nRepublicans.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, it's just about Trump at this juncture and I think that when we look at\\n\\nthe effort that's going to take place in the Senate, again, it's about\\n\\nRepublicans who are early entries into the 2024 GOP primary. I don't think\\n\\nthose people are loyal to Trump, obviously, because they are preparing to\\n\\nchallenge him in 2024, but they are making a play for the base that you're\\n\\ntalking about, Bret, and saying to that base I'll buy into the conspiracy\\n\\ntheories, I'll support your doubts and your cynicism about American\\n\\npolitics when it doesn't go our way.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Yeah, Senators Loeffler and Perdue are hoping the president can\\n\\ntake those supporters across the finish line for the 5th.\\n\\n\\n\\nPanel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.\\n\\n\\n\\nComing up, we talked to Hakeem Jeffries with the Democratic caucus about\\n\\nwhat the next Congress will look like and Speaker Pelosi's chances.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Coming up, debate over increased stimulus checks makes for strange\\n\\nbedfellows.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Trump is right in saying that's not enough. We\\n\\nneed to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was visionary. He's right on this\\n\\nissue.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: We'll ask Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries where the relief\\n\\nchecks stand next.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're back now in Atlanta.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis afternoon in Washington, the 117th Congress gets sworn in and\\n\\nlawmakers in the House will elect their new speaker. Nancy Pelosi, who has\\n\\nserved 17 years as the Democrat's leader, is running unopposed, but her\\n\\npath to victory is a narrow one.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoining us now from D.C., one of the top Democrats in the house, Hakeem\\n\\nJeffries.\\n\\n\\n\\nCongressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY) Good morning. Happy New Year.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Yes, Happy New Year to you.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat do you say to voters here in Georgia who say, listen, we think divided\\n\\ngovernment works better. And, frankly, they say they're scared of a senator\\n\\n-- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, your party controlling all the\\n\\nHouse, Senate, and the White House, and progressives having control of the\\n\\nlegislative agenda? What do you say to those voters?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: Well, those very same Georgia voters saw fit to elect Joe Biden\\n\\nis the next president of the United States of America, believing that he\\n\\nhas the heart and the experience and the compassion and the empathy to\\n\\naddress the challenges that are facing everyday Americans.\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe Biden will be the leader of the Democratic Party. More importantly, as\\n\\nthe next president of the United States, Joe Biden, as he has indicated, is\\n\\ngoing to be the president for all Americans, both those who voted for him\\n\\nand those who didn't.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd here in the House, we look forward to working closely with him, as well\\n\\nas Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to get things done on behalf of\\n\\nthe American people.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: As I mentioned at the top, Speaker Pelosi is running unopposed for\\n\\nthat speakership, but how many votes in the House do you think Nancy Pelosi\\n\\nwill lose?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the United States\\n\\nHouse of Representatives and I look forward to placing her name into\\n\\nnomination as part of my responsibilities as chair of the House Democratic\\n\\nCaucus. There is incredible enthusiasm for Speaker Pelosi because she's\\n\\ndone the work and she's been an historic, legendary legislative leader\\n\\nthrough incredibly turbulent times. We've been through a lot of trials and\\n\\ntribulations as Americans. Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, has\\n\\nhelped to guide us through that and we look forward to her continuing in\\n\\nthat capacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: You said Joe Biden is going to be the leader of the party, but how\\n\\ndoes Nancy Pelosi control the left part of your caucus, the progressives,\\n\\nand steer legislation through the House with a much more narrow path\\n\\nbecause of the votes that you have?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: Well, we are a very big family in terms of the House Democratic\\n\\nCaucus. We are a diverse family. We're an enthusiastic family. We believe\\n\\nin the House that our charge is to reflect the hopes, the dreams, the\\n\\naspirations, the passions of the American people that's consistent with the\\n\\nUnited States Constitution. And Speaker Pelosi understands that a big tent\\n\\napproach to getting things done on behalf of the American people is\\n\\nincredibly important.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe've taken that approach, not just internally, but externally over the\\n\\nlast several years. We've worked closely with President Trump on issues\\n\\nlike criminal justice reform, with the passage of the historic First Step\\n\\nAct. We worked closely with President Trump with respect to the United\\n\\nStates Mexico Canada trade agreement, which was an historic trade agreement\\n\\nthat protected good paying American jobs. We worked closely with President\\n\\nTrump to end the practice of surprise billing on behalf of the American\\n\\npeople and we continue to stand with President Trump, for instance, as he\\n\\npushes for $2,000 direct stimulus payments.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd so we're always going to govern, not in a partisan way, but in a\\n\\npractical way that gets things done on behalf of the American people. That\\n\\napplies to the House Democratic Caucus. That applies to the House. That\\n\\napplies to the Senate. That applies to the presidency, whether it's a\\n\\nRepublican or a Democrat.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: It's interesting that you point out all of the things that you --\\n\\nthe House worked with President Trump. There is also a new rules package\\n\\nfor the new Congress and in it Democrats widen their subpoena and\\n\\ninvestigative powers, essentially forecasting that this is going to lead to\\n\\n-- there's also a rules change about gender-neutral terms, he or she\\n\\nwould become member or delegate or resident commissioner. Father\\n\\nand mother would become parent, while brother and sister would\\n\\nbecome sibling.\\n\\n\\n\\nAre these the things that are the priority going after the Trump\\n\\nadministration in investigations and changing the way people talk about\\n\\ngender-neutral terms?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: Well, the top priority of House Democrats is going to be to crush\\n\\nthe virus, continue to provide direct assistance to everyday Americans who\\n\\nare struggling and ultimately supercharge our economy for the good of\\n\\neveryone. I know that will be a priority of President Biden in his first\\n\\n100 days. That will continue to be our focus.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a once in a century pandemic. It requires a once in a century\\n\\ncontinuing, comprehensive and compassionate congressional response. And so\\n\\nthat's going to be our focus as we move forward. That has been our focus\\n\\nover the last year, and that continues until we can put this deadly\\n\\npandemic behind us.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: OK. Then why expand the subpoena investigative powers?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: Well, the House is a separate and co-equal branch of government\\n\\nat the end of the day. We don't work for any president, whether that's a\\n\\nDemocrat or a Republican, whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And we\\n\\nhave a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on any\\n\\nexecutive branch.\\n\\n\\n\\nI wouldn't interpret any change in rules as an effort to look backward with\\n\\nrespect to Donald Trump's presidency.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we felt it was the right thing to do, consistent with our\\n\\nconstitutional responsibilities to hold this president accountable, we took\\n\\nthat step. But as we move forward, I think our concern is going to be\\n\\nfocused on kitchen table, pocketbook issues, dealing with the health care\\n\\nchallenges of the American people, making sure that we can bring good\\n\\npaying jobs, prosperity in every single zip code I think should be our\\n\\nguiding principle. And, of course, working closely with Joe Biden and\\n\\nKamala Harris to build back better for the people.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: And then the rule about changing -- imposing more gender-neutral\\n\\nlanguage, I guess critics would say that this is not the message from the\\n\\nelection. Democrats lost a number of seats that they were thinking they\\n\\nwere going to win. Traditionally, you know, there would be critics that say\\n\\nthey're -- Democrats are too focused on political correctness and that this\\n\\nis an example of that. How would you respond to that?\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: This is just an example of making sure that we are as inclusive\\n\\nas possible. You know, the framers of the Constitution envisioned the House\\n\\nat the institution that was the closest to the people and, in their words,\\n\\nthat would reflect the passions of the American people. It's the reason why\\n\\nwe have two-year terms as opposed to four years of the presidency, six\\n\\nyears in the Senate, life tenure for the Supreme Court. And so I think that\\n\\nthe rules should reflect our values as an institution that is the most\\n\\ninclusive as possible, that reflects the gorgeous mosaic in every possible\\n\\nway of the American people.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Speaker Pelosi, you mentioned the stimulus checks and the direct\\n\\npayment. She has characterized direct payments to Americans different ways,\\n\\nbeginning with the direct payments from the Trump tax cuts, then the\\n\\nnegotiated stimulus deal that she negotiated at first and then this new\\n\\neffort to get more direct payments.\\n\\n\\n\\nTake a listen.\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): In terms of the bonus that corporate America\\n\\nreceived versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put\\n\\nthe schmooze on is so pathetic.\\n\\n\\n\\nI would like them to have been bigger, but they are significant and they\\n\\nwill be going out soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is holding up that distribution to the American people? Mitch McConnell\\n\\nand the Senate Republicans.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Congressman, there's a lot to digest there. The $1,000 direct\\n\\npayment was crumbs. $600 was significant. And then the $2,000 was being\\n\\nheld up by the Senate. But she negotiated with Secretary Mnuchin and\\n\\nSenator McConnell for that original stimulus deal.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo people looking at that scratch their heads.\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: The most important thing that Speaker Pelosi indicated is that\\n\\nMitch McConnell is holding up direct payment checks that are more robust to\\n\\nthe American people. We agree with President Trump. Republicans in the\\n\\nHouse of Representatives agree that we should increase those direct\\n\\npayments to $2,000 per American because the American people are hurting in\\n\\na tremendous way.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, when it comes to the tax cuts from 2017, we all, on the Democratic\\n\\nside, had a big problem with that because we went into $2 trillion worth of\\n\\ndebt for tax cuts were 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1\\n\\npercent, to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected. That was not\\n\\ngood public policy in my humble opinion.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think, at the current moment, what we need to do is make sure that we're\\n\\nproviding relief to middle-class Americans, to those who aspire to be part\\n\\nof the middle class, to working families, to the poor and the sick and the\\n\\nafflicted, those who have been impacted the most by this pandemic. That's\\n\\nwhat we're trying to do. And we're asking Mitch McConnell to join the\\n\\nAmerican people, join President Trump, join House Democrats and many House\\n\\nRepublicans in getting this done.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Congressman, thank you for your time. Thanks for joining us on this\\n\\nholiday weekend. Happy New Year.\\n\\n\\n\\nJEFFRIES: Thank you. Happy New Year, again, to you and your viewers.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Up next, we'll discuss how the incoming Congress will work with the\\n\\nBiden administration when the panel returns as we count down to the\\n\\ncritical Georgia runoffs from Atlanta.\\n\\n\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. JIM INHOFE (R-OK): People are talking about the Democrats and\\n\\nRepublicans don't do things together. This has been an example of what can\\n\\nhappen in government.\\n\\n\\n\\nSEN. JACK REED (D-RI): We provide for the support of our service men and\\n\\nwomen and their families. Think about them and their families and you'll\\n\\nappreciate, I think, more of what they do every day.\\n\\n\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Senate Armed Services Chair James Inhofe and Ranking Member Jack\\n\\nReed on the New Year's Day override of President Trump's veto of the\\n\\ndefense spending bill.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd we're back with our panel.\\n\\n\\n\\nCatherine, that veto override was a moment of bipartisanship. We heard\\n\\nSenator Loeffler not really answer that question, what she would do about\\n\\nthat vote. Neither Loeffler or Perdue voted for that veto override.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs you look to Georgia, how significant is that, or is it more about\\n\\ncontrol of the U.S. Senate and how that plays here?\\n\\n\\n\\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it was interesting, Bret,\\n\\nhow senator Loeffler was very careful to avoid that question. She,\\n\\nobviously, is focused on the runoff and the fact that they need President\\n\\nTrump to come and help them get voters out for Election Day. Republicans\\n\\nknow that they're at a deficit in early voting and they really need a huge\\n\\nturnout for Election Day.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think a thing to think about also with that override is obviously it was\\n\\na notable moment in President Trump's tenure. It's the first time we've\\n\\nseen that. And it does speak to the fact that even as, you know, a lot of\\n\\nsenators are lining up to support his efforts to, you know, contest the\\n\\nelection results and are, you know, a growing number are looking to do\\n\\nthat, that there are still moments in which his party is prepared to buck\\n\\nhim. And this -- obviously, this is a long-standing, you know, bipartisan\\n\\npiece of legislation. They take a lot of pride in. They're very concerned\\n\\nabout support for the military and this was one of those moments.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Jason, depending on how Tuesday comes out here and control of the\\n\\nSenate, either way we're going to see Washington operate differently after\\n\\nJanuary 20th.\\n\\n\\n\\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes,\\n\\nthe margins are so razor-thin, both in the Senate -- you have one or two\\n\\nsenators going one direction or another. That changes the equation. And\\n\\neven in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi has the run of her life\\n\\nto run the gauntlet today. I don't know that she can actually get there,\\n\\nbut she probably will. History shows that she pulls that off. But every\\n\\nsingle vote is going to come down to four or five people to sway that and\\n\\nreally be in a power position to try to negotiate something else.\\n\\n\\n\\nI think Washington's going to have a very difficult time moving legislation\\n\\nif the Senate goes to the Republicans' hands. That's the best conservative\\n\\nmove we can have is to elect the two Republican senators in Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Does that suggest, Jason, that if you were still in Congress, that\\n\\nthere would be -- you would try to make an effort to work with moderates to\\n\\nget legislation through if you're dealing with the Biden administration? I\\n\\nmean is -- is that what we're going to see, a kind of a rise of the\\n\\nmoderates?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: If there were any moderates left. I think most of the moderates\\n\\nactually lost. I think the progressive far radical left side of the party\\n\\nhas taken that over. I think the AOCs, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the\\n\\nsquad, and more left-leaning members have really got Nancy Pelosi over the\\n\\nbarrel. I think you're going to see the House of Representatives, under\\n\\nNancy Pelosi, further to the left than we've ever seen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Juan, paint the picture of the two different results of Tuesday and\\n\\nhow Washington operates if the Republicans hold on and win one of the two\\n\\nand McConnell stays Senate majority leader or if Democrats pick up two and\\n\\nits Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.\\n\\n\\n\\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that Mitch\\n\\nMcConnell is a shrewd tactician, Bret, and his goal will be to block much\\n\\nof what Joe Biden and the Democrats, especially as they paint it, you know,\\n\\nthese radical Democrats want to do. So if -- if McConnell maintains hold of\\n\\nthe gavel as the Senate majority leader, look for that. I think he may have\\n\\nto make some concessions, as you were suggesting, dealing with moderates\\n\\nbecause his margins are smaller.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the House side, I think that's also the case.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow, you know, Nancy Pelosi, we were talking earlier about whether or not\\n\\nshe'll be the next speaker. I think the only question today is whether or\\n\\nnot enough Democrats are able to come in a day early to vote for her. But\\n\\nshe has proven to be very tough, able to go toe-to-toe with McConnell, even\\n\\nwith Trump, and I think hold that caucus together, which also will be a\\n\\nvery slim Democratic majority, much as McConnell will have a slimmer\\n\\nRepublican majority in the Senate.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Yes, Catherine, I mean that's a key point. In the House it's going\\n\\nto be tight for any -- really any piece of legislation. Four members\\n\\nshifting could change the dynamic for the majority.\\n\\n\\n\\nLUCEY: That's right. It's very tight. And I think a look to, as we move\\n\\nforward is, you know, for the president-elect, Joe Biden really ran on the\\n\\nidea that he's someone who understands The Hill, he can work there, he has\\n\\nrelationships, you know, on both sides of the aisle. He and Pelosi go back\\n\\na very long way.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut he's also laid out an ambitious agenda of things he would like to do,\\n\\nyou know, around climate change, around immigration, around tax cuts -- you\\n\\nknow, taxes. So how he's going to do that with these narrow majorities and\\n\\nparticularly if they do not win back the majority in the Senate, it remains\\n\\nto be seen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: Yes,\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd, finally, Jason, what do you think Tuesday comes down to here?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: Turn out. I don't think there's anybody that's undecided. I think\\n\\nRepublicans have given a mixed message. Hey, the system is corrupt, but get\\n\\nout and vote. Donald Trump has got to deliver on Monday night. Republicans\\n\\nhave to show up. If Republicans show up, I think they will win and the --\\n\\nthe wildcard in all this are the libertarians. One hundred thousand\\n\\nlibertarians in the presidential election, which direction do they go? Do\\n\\nthey show up and vote? Voter turnout is everything.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: But does the disaffected election challenge voter not show up\\n\\nbecause they're angry?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAFFETZ: I think that's the big threat. I think that's the mixed message.\\n\\nI think that's been the unfortunate part of the message coming out. You've\\n\\neven had key Trump supporter is going out there and saying don't vote. But\\n\\nthat's the exact opposite of what needs to happen. It's one of the big\\n\\nconcerns. It has been a mixed message, but people need to get out and vote.\\n\\nEvery vote will count. It's going to be a razor-thin margin one way or the\\n\\nother.\\n\\n\\n\\nBAIER: All right, panel, thank you. We'll cover it all.

Since then, he has often criticized President Bush's Iraq policy, leading some Democrats, including rival presidential candidate former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, to accuse Kerry of trying to have it both ways.\\n\\nKerry, who leads in most polls, has largely ignored attacks from the trailing Dean, but with the Republicans coming after him, Kerry dug in.\\n\\nThe real test of patriotism is in how you make America stronger and we fought for the right to be able to talk in this country about real choices. And they come along with these phony claims. I am not going to be deterred by them. I am not going to be pushed around by them, he said.\\n\\nRepublicans see political value in attacking the perceived Democratic frontrunner and at the same time defending the commander-in-chief.\\n\\nKerry defends his remarks as a decorated Vietnam veteran, a fact he notes in every speech, including to a New York teachers union convention in Washington on Friday.\\n\\nKerry is the only veteran in the field of nine Democratic presidential candidates, and his aides note that none of the most vocal GOP critics, Delay and Frist included, have served in the military.\\n\\nFox News' Naheda Zayed contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Even as GOP congressional leaders insist the party stands firmly behind the White House, some Republican senators are signaling support for spending bills that would end the ongoing partial federal government shutdown without including money for President Trump's proposed border wall.\\n\\nThe GOP's 53-member majority can weather several defections in the Senate, and Trump has threatened to use his veto power to defeat any legislation to reopen the government without wall funding. But the indications on Wednesday that some Republicans are increasingly wary of the shutdown, which Trump has said could last for years, highlighted the potential political pitfalls of leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or without pay. (Some 380,000 are furloughed, and approximately 420,000 are working without pay.)\\n\\nI'm talking to a lot of folks that are in the same camp that, hey, we all want to have better, stronger border security, we all want to address humanitarian issues, but we're all concerned about what is turning out to be the longest partial shutdown ever, Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski told Fox News after meeting with Trump for lunch with other congressional leaders on Wednesday.\\n\\nShe continued: I addressed the things that are very local to us. It's not just those who don't receive a federal paycheck on Friday, but there are other consequences for those of us who utilize [federal] services, whether it's those who are seeking to get a fish scale certified so you can deliver product.\\n\\nPELOSI: TRUMP THINKS FURLOUGHED FEDS 'CAN JUST ASK THEIR FATHER FOR MORE MONEY'\\n\\nThe longest shutdown occured in 1995 under President Clinton, when the federal government was shuttered for 21 days. The current shutdown would surpass that record on Saturday, and federal workers would miss their first full paycheck on Friday.\\n\\nThere are consequences, and people are starting to feel those consequences, Murkowski added. The Department of the Interior and the National Parks Service, or the operations of the IRS and whether or not tax refunds go out, don't have anything to do with border security.\\n\\nPELOSI, SCHUMER MOCKED ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH 'ANGRY PARENTS' MEMES AFTER THEIR PRIME TIME TRUMP REBUTTAL\\n\\nSources tell Fox News that Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner remains worried about whether an extended shutdown and dysfunction in Washington could hurt the U.S.'s credit rating, which is based on factors that include politics, monetary policy, economic indicators, and externalities. The county last lost its top-notch credit status in 2011 after Standard and Poor's lowered it from AAA to AA+, amid a showdown over the debt ceiling.\\n\\nThere are consequences, and people are starting to feel those consequences. — Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski\\n\\nGardner, a first-term senator, is up for re-election in 2020, and The Colorado Sun has said his seat is among the most vulnerable in the Senate. A poll conducted late last year found that Gardner's favorability rating hovers near 43 percent. Hillary Clinton bested Trump by five percentage points during the 2016 presidential race in Colorado.\\n\\nAnother Republican senator facing a tough re-election bid in 2020 in a state that went for Clinton in 2016, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins, said Wednesday that she had asked Trump at lunch to consider a compromise to end the shutdown.\\n\\nIN FIRST-EVER PRIME TIME OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS, TRUMP OFFERS COMPROMISE, LAMENTS BORDER 'CRISIS'\\n\\nI suggested that we take a look at the package that we put together last February and brought to the floor as a possible compromise, Collins said, referring to a tentative deal that would have provided visas for so-called Dreamers, or illegal immigrants who entered the U.S. at a young age, in exchange for wall funding.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the House, there was limited GOP support on Wednesday for Democrats' spending bill agenda as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic-led House approved a bill to fund the Treasury Department, the IRS and other agencies for the next year as part of a strategy to reopen the government on a piecemeal basis, but Senate Republicans dismissed the attempt as a nonstarter without any wall funding.\\n\\nEight Republicans joined 232 Democrats in voting for the measure, up from the seven who backed a similar bill last week.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe vote came as Trump, who is slated to visit the southern border on Thursday with top administration officials, walked out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday afternoon over the partial government shutdown after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi again rejected supporting new funding for a border wall, according to those in the meeting.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters after the brief session, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the president just got up and walked out.\\n\\nHe asked Speaker Pelosi, 'Will you agree to my wall?' She said no. And he just got up, and said, 'Well we've got nothing to discuss,' Schumer said.\\n\\nThe president, in a tweet, called the meeting a total waste of time and appeared to confirm that he left after Pelosi's answer.\\n\\nPelosi, D-Calif., said after the meeting that the president was petulant. Schumer said Trump slammed his hand on a table in frustration, but Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans, speaking to reporters afterward, denied that happened.\\n\\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the president was willing to make a deal in the meeting, echoing Trump's remarks during his first-ever prime time Oval Office address on Thursday, when he called for compromise -- even as Democrats responded by flatly rejecting a border wall.\\n\\nFox News' Alex Pappas, Mike Emanuel and Caroline McKee contributed to this report."}

{"original": "Congratulations, new members of the House and Senate.\\n\\nYou are no longer Washington outsiders.\\n\\nYou are now incumbents.\\n\\nAre you part of the swamp? The deep state? The establishment? That's unclear. But you are most certainly now inside the Beltway.\\n\\nMost who come to Washington contend they won't go native and will fight against the unholy monikers listed above. There's merit in that. But consider this quotation from Katharine Graham, the longtime publisher of the Washington Post: When it comes to Washington, most people tend to think first of politics. But Washington is also a geographic and physical place. It is, for instance, one of the few cities in the world where you can talk endlessly about trees.\\n\\nWho are we to quibble with the keen observations of the late, great Katharine Graham? However, we can assure you, most Washington conversations are bereft of dendrology.\\n\\nSome observations.\\n\\nThe House and Senate welcome a prodigiously large class of freshmen to Washington for the 116th Congress. Collectively more than 90 brand new people in both bodies.\\n\\nTwo things about big congressional classes. They are so massive that inevitably some new Members will commit what are regarded as amateur mistakes. Some are just stumbles. Others are glaring errors. Some major scandals. That was certainly the case with big classes welcomed to Washington following major political upheaval in 1974, 1994, 2006, 2008 and 2010. You never quite know who might step in it. But the classes are so large that the odds of a freshman miscue grow geometrically.\\n\\nReporters lurk everywhere. In fact, there are many more reporters, photographers and technical personnel credentialed to cover Congress than lawmakers themselves. A big bus doesn't pull up each day in front of the Capitol and dump the press corps on the plaza. Reporters are here all times of the day and the night. Generalists who report on news of the day. Specialists who know granular details of transportation policy or military issues in Syria. There are reporters who just parachute in for big events like State of the Union or for President George H.W. Bush to lie in state.\\n\\nIf you're a senator, don't be surprised at the crush of reporters when you trek from your office through the underground tunnels en route to the Capitol for a vote on the floor. You'll have to run a gauntlet of scribes camped out in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building, staked out out in Capitol subway station and floating between the big Senate elevator bank and Ohio Clock Corridor off the floor. On the House side, reporters prowl in the Speaker's Lobby behind the House chamber and roam the hallway near the Will Rogers Statue. The press corps is as much a part of the fabric of Capitol Hill as the Members and staffers themselves.\\n\\nMembers of Congress boast an impressive skill set. There are good orators. Others are legislative technicians. Many are great campaigners. Some are outstanding at constituent service and dealing with the public. You'll find an expert in almost every policy area imaginable, ranging from civil conflicts in Africa to the fishing rights of Native American tribes.\\n\\nWhat's the most important attribute for a lawmaker? Stamina. As the late Rep. Vern Ehlers (R-MI) told me years ago, I work 24 hours a day.\\n\\nCongress moves at an unforgiving velocity. The demands on the schedule of Members of Congress is unrelenting. The travel is brutal. There's stress. Upset constituents. Upset Congressional whips. We already mentioned the pesky media. Maintaining a healthy work-life balance is a near impossibility. It's not for everyone. There should be little surprise why there were so many vacancies leading to this January's gargantuan freshman class.\\n\\nRookie lawmakers also have a steep learning curve for how the institution works. What's the difference between a bill and a resolution? A bill can actually become law. Most resolutions aren't binding. What is the difference between the budget and appropriations? Budgets are broad, fiscal blueprints lacking the force of law. Budgets encompass how much money the federal government spends each year. Appropriations are live ammo. Congress dictates appropriations to fund the 12 annual spending bills and run the government each year. There's also the difference between discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is another word for an appropriation. In other words, Congress wields discretion over spending that money or not. Mandatory spending is on automatic pilot. Entitlements, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Congress doesn't allot an annual appropriation for these programs. Thus, that spending is mandatory.\\n\\nLawmakers make lots of promises about the bills they intend to pass. But in reality, there are only about 60 Members in both the House and Senate with the acumen to advance major legislation. That's not to say lawmakers can't sign on to and co-sponsor bills which move successfully across the House and Senate floors. But those capable of engineering a bill from scratch and shepherding it through final passage is a pretty limited group. Some are in fact freshmen. Some grow into that role down the road. And some never master this skill.\\n\\nAlso, new lawmakers aren't even sure of what kind of legislators they want to be once they hit town. They often evolve.\\n\\nAlmost 30 years ago, an upstart freshman arrived in Washington to take the Capitol by storm. He joined a group of other like-minded freshman, forming the Gang of Seven, determined to challenge the old ways of Congress. They criticized its day-to-day operations. That freshman garnered national attention as a vocal back-bencher. But after a few years, the same member gained seniority and became a committee chairman by working within the system. That member? Former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).\\n\\nHere's one nugget of sage advice senior lawmakers will tell the Congressional neophytes: Get to know and be nice to the Capitol cops. The U.S. Capitol Police force guards the Capitol 24/7, 365 days a year. It's officers are tasked with a thankless, impossible job. With such a big class of lawmakers coming in, it will take officers a while to learn what all of the newcomers look like. Former Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-GA) famously berated a U.S. Capitol Police officer who didn't recognize her. McKinney poked the officer in the chest with a closed fist.\\n\\nIt's hard for freshmen – not named Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) – to garner press attention when you're one member in an institution of 535 people. But beating up on the USCP is a surefire way for a freshman to stand out.\\n\\nOr, just hours after you're sworn-in, you can use an expletive to refer to the president of the United States."}
{"original": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said that the idea that President Trump was a threat to national security was absolutely ludicrous after the New York Times reported that the FBI launched an investigation into whether Trump posed such a threat.\\n\\nI'm not going to comment on New York Times stories but I'll certainly say this: The notion that President Trump is a threat to American national security is absolutely ludicrous, Pompeo said on CBS' Face the Nation in an interview to be aired Sunday.\\n\\nTRUMP SLAMS 'TOTAL SLEAZE' COMEY, 'CORRUPT' FBI LEADERS, AFTER REPORT BUREAU LAUNCHES PROBE AFTER DIRECTOR'S OUSTER\\n\\nThe Times reported in a bombshell story Friday that law enforcement officials became concerned after the firing of then-FBI Director James Comey in May 2017 that the agency began investigating if Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests and was a threat to national security.\\n\\nThe timing of the investigation raises questions as both Comey and FBI lawyer Lisa Page told House investigators last year that by the time the FBI director was fired and special counsel appointed, there was no hard evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\\n\\nFormer law enforcement officials told the newspaper that the criminal and counterintelligence elements of the investigation were combined because Trump's firing of the FBI director could constitute both a crime and a national security threat as it would hinder the agency's abilities to learn how the Kremlin interfered in the 2016 election.\\n\\nPompeo, a former CIA director, was one of a number of Trump administration officials to blast the revelations contained in the Times' report.\\n\\nThe idea that's contained in The New York Times story that President Trump was a threat to American national security is silly on its face and not worthy of a response, Pompeo said\\n\\nOther administration officials and Trump allies also weighed in on the report, suggesting that it was a sign that the FBI was out of control. Trump, in a series of tweets described former leaders of the agency as corrupt and accused them of opening an investigation for no reason & with no proof.\\n\\nPOMPEO'S CAIRO SPEECH IS A FUNDAMENTAL TURNING POINT FOR US FOREIGN POLICY IN THESE THREE WATERSHED WAYS\\n\\nJohn Dowd, the president's attorney on special counsel matters, said the Times story is an unwitting disclosure and verification of the utter corruption of their oaths by Comey and his colleagues to undermine the free election of the President of the United States.\\n\\nIt was apparently done under the supervision of the deputy attorney general who was reportedly ready to wear a wire to ensnare President Trump. This is the stuff of banana republics and dictatorships, he said.\\n\\nRep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the story was more evidence that FBI leaders actually had no real evidence against the Trump team.\\n\\nInstead, they were simply trying to undermine a president they didn't like and avenge Comey's firing. By relying on the Steele dossier — a fraudulent document funded by Democrats and based on Russian sources — FBI leaders were either complicit or too oblivious to notice they were being used in a disinformation operation by the Democratic Party and Russian operatives, he said in a statement.\\n\\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement Saturday with a different perspective.\\n\\nWhile I cannot comment on the specifics of the New York Times report, I can say that counterintelligence concerns about those associated with the Trump campaign, including the President himself, have been at the heart of our investigation since the beginning, his statement said. Those concerns have not been alleviated by the Committee's work over the last two years; to the contrary, the abundance of meetings, contacts, and communications between Trump associates and the Russians, and the web of lies about those interactions, and the President's own statements and actions, have only heightened our need to follow the evidence wherever it may lead.\\n\\nThis is also why the President's financial interests and entanglements — as well as those around him — have been of core interest. The House Intelligence Committee has a responsibility to the American people to ensure that the President is working in our national interest and is not motivated by any other factor, and we are pressing forward with that work.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nComey didn't directly respond on the story or Trump's remarks, only tweeting a quote from former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.\\n\\nThe FBI investigation has since been taken over by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. There's no indication that Mueller is continuing to pursue the counterintelligence matter.\\n\\nFox News' Lukas Mikelionis and Catherine Herridge contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Twitter announced the permanent suspension of President Trump's account Friday, following months of flagging his tweets with warnings -- and days after the company said he violated its policies.\\n\\nThe platform locked Trump out of his account for the first time this week. The social media company deemed a number of tweets connected to the violent protests at the Capitol on Wednesday as inflammatory.\\n\\nAfter close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence, the company wrote in a blog post.\\n\\nLater, when the president shared three messages from the official @POTUS handle, Twitter quickly took them down. He sent the same text out in a statement to White House reporters, criticizing Twitter as an opponent of free speech and teasing a potential new conservative social media platform in the future.\\n\\nThe official account had, until that point, not shared any tweets since late December. It will be transferred to President-elect Joe Biden after Inauguration Day and remains active.\\n\\nTRUMP SAYS HE WON'T ATTEND BIDEN'S INAUGURATION\\n\\nThe president's account was suspended Wednesday night after he posted a video with a message for protesters who had stormed the Capitol earlier. After violence that led to multiple deaths, Trump told them to go home, but maintained that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.\\n\\nTwitter removed the president's video before suspending his account and warning that further violations of the platform's policies could result in a permanent suspension.\\n\\nSharing two tweets from the president Friday, including one in which he said he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, the company argued that they had to be viewed in part of a greater context.\\n\\nFACEBOOK BLOCKS TRUMP IDNEFINITELY AFTER CAPITOL RIOT RESPONSE\\n\\nThe other read: The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\\n\\nThe mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election, Twitter stated.\\n\\nThe blog post claimed plans for future armed protests over the election results already were being shared both on and off the platform -- including a proposed secondary attack on Capitol Hill.\\n\\nThese two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President's statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks, the company said.

But some of his more fiery tweets have drawn criticism, sometimes from his own party.\\n\\nTwitter confirmed in early December that special privileges granted to world leaders are rescinded once they leave office. The platform has a public interest exemption for prominent figures whose words are newsworthy and important for their citizens to read, even if they violate the rules.\\n\\nTWITTER WEIGHS IN ON WHETHER TRUMP COULD BE BANNED AFTER LEAVING OFFICE\\n\\nTrump's personal Twitter account had more than 88 million followers as of last month. Amid the 2020 presidential election, Twitter began attaching fact-checking warnings to some of Trump's tweets. Messages containing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud garnered warning tags that read, This claim about election fraud is disputed.\\n\\nFacebook also permanently blocked Trump on Thursday night.\\n\\nWe believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement Thursday. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.\\n\\nWhite House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere slammed the company at the time.\\n\\nIt is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people, but it's incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so, Deere told Fox News. Big Tech is out of control.\\n\\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on his permanent Twitter suspension.\\n\\nTwitter's longstanding policy is to ban accounts that promote violent extremism, share personal information of others in order to harass them (also known as doxing), or engage in abusive behavior or operating fake accounts, among other violations. The company argued Friday that Trump's most recent tweets risked inspiring people to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021.\\n\\nAnd after Wednesday's rioting on Capitol Hill, the company appeared ready to take more drastic action.\\n\\nThe use of the words 'American Patriots' to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol, Twitter said.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nEarlier in the day, Twitter also permanently banned Trump allies Michael Flynn and the attorney Sidney Powell for harmful activity on the platform."}

The package would focus on income inequality and climate change, combining ideas incorporated in former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's signature New Deal, and modern ideas like renewable energy and resource efficiency.\\n\\nA draft text of the plan has circulated around Congress and laid out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.

{"original": "Despite earlier claims this year by the Afghan Taliban that talks for a peace deal to end the protracted conflict were on track, the militant group abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with U.S. officials in Qatar this week over an apparent agenda disagreement.\\n\\nThe points of contention appear to me about much than just talking points, however. The Taliban doesn't want representatives of the existing Afghan government puppets to be there, and prefer to speak directly to U.S officials. But there's frustration as well with the U.S, which would free only 3,000 of the 25,000 Taliban prisoners the group wants released.\\n\\nThe U.S. has a different position. Taliban should talk to fellow Afghans as much as they talk to the media, the American ambassador to Kabul, John Bass, tweeted in response to the cancelation.\\n\\nU.S policy and intelligence analysts were mostly not surprised by the abrupt rebuff by Taliban brass as part of their negotiation strategy.\\n\\nThis is to be expected. The Taliban will try to drive a hard bargain, given the battlespace realities, and the fact that the Trump administration's need for a deal this year.

The two days of discussions, slated to start Wednesday, were constitute the fourth round of talks with the U.S Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, Zalmay Khalilzad. The last round was held in Abu Dhabi in mid-December, and also attended by officials from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the hosting United Arab Emirates.\\n\\nKhalizad has embarked on a two-week diplomatic tour intended to further promote and develop the talks, and is slated to visit Afghanistan, China, Pakistan, and India.\\n\\nA Taliban office was first established in Qatar's capital Doha in 2013 at the request of the United States to facilitate the talks. But the office was shuttered after the group violated terms of the agreement by showcasing the same flag the group used during its rule in Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe Taliban calls U.S involvement in the country – now the longest-running war in U.S history – as an illegitimate occupation by foreign forces. And despite the hardline outfit's continued disavowal of the Afghan government, and the refusal to have them join negotiations, some experts insist it's only in their best interest.\\n\\nWhile much of the media narrative has centered around the notion the Taliban controls more of Afghanistan than the government amid a stalemate war, the areas under militant control are mostly rural, and not major transport hubs or major cities.\\n\\nThe Taliban realizes this is in their best interest to talk. But talks with an adversary like this are a process, not an event. It could take a very long time and there will be highs and lows, noted Luke Coffey, a policy expert with The Heritage Foundation. In the end, it might not succeed. But the right thing to do is try."}

Will some networks choose not to air Trump's speech in full, or attempt to fact-check his statements live?\\n\\nAnd will Trump, as he has suggested repeatedly in recented days, announce that he will use his emergency powers to build the wall even without congressional funding?\\n\\nHow will Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handle their unusual, nationally televised tandem response to Trump's remarks?\\n\\nThe White House requested eight minutes to make Trump's case on television. It invited representatives from cable news outlets to a White House lunch with Trump ahead of the address, a gesture that is typically reserved for the lead-up to State of the Union speeches.\\n\\nRegardless of what transpires, negotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.\\n\\nOn Thursday, Trump plans a personal visit to the Mexican border, where his administration says an illegal immigration crisis is worsening by the day.\\n\\nThe number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.\\n\\nBORDER CRISIS INTENSIFIES AMID SHUTDOWN: MASSIVE INCREASE IN FAMILY UNITS CROSSED BORDER ILLEGALLY IN 2018\\n\\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News that he doesn't know what Trump will say during his prime-time address.

John Thune of South Dakota, the GOP whip, said he doesn't think the emergency declaration is the right move and that I prefer that we get this resolved the old-fashioned way.\\n\\nAnd Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-.Ky., who met with Vice President Mike Pencc on Capitol Hill earlier in the day, did not answer when asked by Fox News on Tuesday whether he thought declaring a national emergency would be a good idea. But in a statement and remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell emphasized his support for the White House's aggressive tack.\\n\\nCAN TRUMP USE EMERGENCY POWERS TO BUILD A BORDER WALL?\\n\\nIn light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.\\n\\nHouse GOP leaders, after speaking with Pence, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Tuesday, seemed similarly aligned.\\n\\nGOP Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, reiterated to Fox News that he thinks a congressional compromise -- rather than emergency military spending -- is the best way to build the wall.\\n\\nAnd House Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said the president may take whatever action he needs to fund the wall.\\n\\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway seemed optimistic, giving a thumbs-up sign to reporters after the meeting.\\n\\nAfter a sit-down with Democrats over the weekend, the White House issued a series of budget demands, including a new request for $800,000 for humanitarian needs. But mostly Trump still wants his wall, which Democrats describe as immoral as well as no solution to illegal immigration.\\n\\nIn a pre-emptive move, the White House said Monday that tax refunds would be paid despite the shutdown. That shutdown exemption would break from past practice and could be challenged.\\n\\nEmphasizing that he's not abandoning his security argument, Trump said in a fundraising email Tuesday: I want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!\\n\\nPelosi, for her part, has also sparred openly with the White House. She reportedly engaged in a tense confrontation with Nielsen on Wednesday in the Situation Room, with the California Democrat interrupting Nielsen's presentation on border security and illegal immigration, telling her I reject your facts.\\n\\nLeaning on Senate Republicans, some of whom are growing anxious about the impact of the shutdown, Pelosi said the House would begin passing individual bills this week to reopen shuttered federal agencies, starting with the Treasury Department to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds.\\n\\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nWhile Tuesday night promised to be a historic night and a kind of political prime-time prizefight, television viewers who were hoping to have a less political evening still have options.\\n\\nIf you're looking for anything even remotely worth watching tonight at 9pm EST, I will be folding laundry in my underwear for 8 minutes on Instagram live, porn star Stormy Daniels, whose protracted legal battle with the president has dominated national headlines, wrote Tuesday afternooon on Twitter.\\n\\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Alex Pappas, Jason Donner, and The Associated Press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "According to the left, the Trump administration cares nothing about human rights.\\n\\nThat's a bad rap. Exhibit A: Venezuela.\\n\\nVenezuela is in deep trouble: hyperinflation, food shortages, scarce medical supplies, and soaring violence born of desperation.\\n\\nMORE FROM OPINION: WE CAN'T IGNORE VENEZUELA'S CRISIS\\n\\nIt's all the doing of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, his successor Nicolás Maduro, and their fellow kleptocrats.\\n\\nThough America didn't cause Venezuela's problems, the Trump administration is trying to be part of the solution. Its primary motive: to ease the intolerable suffering caused by the socialist regime and its destabilizing effects on the entire region.\\n\\nWATCH: VENEZUELA IS A STRONG WARNING TO SOCIALISTS\\n\\nNearly three-quarters of a century ago, Winston Churchill described socialism as the equal sharing of misery. Venezuela under Maduro shows that description holds true today.\\n\\nHow miserable is it? Since Maduro came to power, more than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country. Most remain in Latin America, but nearly 400,000 have come to the U.S.\\n\\nWith the exception of a corrupt and privileged elite, almost everyone remaining in Venezuela is now destitute. The government stopped reporting poverty statistics in 2015, but by some outside estimates, 90 percent of the oil-rich country now lives in poverty.\\n\\nIn theory, under socialism, the community as a whole owns or regulates all the means of the production and exchange. The idea is that this will assure that the working class controls the economy and gets its fair share of its benefits—the goods and services they produce.\\n\\nThe problem is that socialist theory provides no checks and balances in socialism to keep the ideology from devolving into what Churchill called the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy. In practice, power to the people in places like Venezuela quickly starts channeling into more and more power in the hands of government.\\n\\nMaduro's regime has now monopolized political and economic control and sucked the country dry. Having impoverished the nation, Maduro retains his grip on power by intertwining the government with organized crime—it doesn't help the people, but it keeps the cash coming to him and his cronies in Caracas.\\n\\nThe Obama administration largely watched from the sidelines as the Venezuelan regime ran the country into the ground. It stood silent as then-Vice President Tareck Zaidan El Aissami, an alleged drug-trafficking kingpin, worked hand in glove with Los Zetas and other regional drug cartels. It was not until Trump came into office that the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on El Aissami.\\n\\nEl Aissami, who still serves as Maduro's Minister of Industries and National Production, is no outlier. The regime is shot through with corruption. The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on more than 60 Venezuelan government officials for human rights violations and other offenses undermining the country's democratic order.\\n\\nHe's also hitting the bankrupt regime where it hurts the most: U.S. investors from purchasing Venezuelan debt that keeps Maduro afloat.\\n\\nNor is the White House working alone. It has gotten allies and partners such as the EU, Canada, Panama and Colombia to issue their own sanctions against corrupt Venezuelan officials. And it has convinced the Lima Group (a bloc of democratic countries in Latin America) and the Organization of American States to take unprecedented actions against the regime.\\n\\nIn getting deservedly tough with Maduro and his henchmen, Trump was wise not to push for oil sanctions. Hitting the energy sector would hurt the Venezuelan people far more than their socialist masters—a tactic not calculated to lead to a new government more friendly to the U.S.\\n\\nMoreover, oil is the not the Achilles heel of the regime. Maduro and his gang profit mostly off of their criminal enterprises, not state revenues.\\n\\nThe best way forward for the Trump administration, then, is to do more of what it's been doing. For example, it can engage Spain, Colombia and Panama—havens for the regime's ill-gotten games—and ask them to issue stronger targeted sanctions.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nTrump's Venezuela policy has been a model of human rights concern matched with proportional, appropriate, practical pressure. Yet, as is the case with many of his foreign policy initiatives, Trump gets no credit for doing what's right.\\n\\nAmerica's progressive class is so busy talking up the supposed virtues of socialism, it has no time to acknowledge responsible efforts to address socialism's terrible wrongs."}
{"original": "On his first working day in charge of the Pentagon, Pat Shanahan got a taste of President Donald Trump's scattershot way of looking at the world.\\n\\nAs Shanahan sat to Trump's left at a Cabinet meeting at the White House, the president denounced U.S. allies as freeloaders, expressed disgust with U.S. warfighting strategy in Afghanistan, mused about his own potential to be a great general, dismissed Syria as sand and death, spoke encouragingly of a second North Korea summit, and falsely claimed he had fired former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.\\n\\nIt was a very public reminder of the challenges that Shanahan, as acting defense secretary, faces as he navigates the complex terrain that led to the early end of his predecessor's tenure.\\n\\nAt one point, Trump turned to Shanahan with an unusual demand.\\n\\nThe commander in chief said audits of Pentagon war spending must be private — an apparent reference to reports produced by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. Trump asserted that the reports give away too much information and should not be publicly released, although the law that created that watchdog's office says its reports must be made public.\\n\\nTrump wished Mattis well in the retired Marine general's return to private life after two tumultuous years leading the Pentagon. But Trump also took a swipe at the man he had approvingly called Mad Dog Mattis when he hired him shortly after winning election in 2016.\\n\\nWhat's he done for me? Trump asked. How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good.\\n\\nHe added, President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I.\\n\\nTrump did not explain his complaint about Mattis' approach to the war. But Trump hinted that he had irreconcilable differences with Mattis on what Trump views as an unfair defense relationship with allies such as NATO. Trump suggested that Shanahan, who took over as acting defense secretary when Mattis ended his tenure Monday, agrees with him on this.\\n\\nWe have some great allies, but a lot of our allies were taking advantage of our taxpayers and our country, Trump said. We can't let that happen, and Pat Shanahan agrees with that and he's agreed with that for a long time. And that was very important to me.\\n\\nI couldn't get other people to understand it, Trump said, apparently referring to Mattis, who argued for higher defense spending by NATO allies but did so in a nonconfrontational way.\\n\\nIn a resignation letter that amounted to a rebuke of Trump's view on how to treat alliances and adversaries, Mattis wrote, My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues.\\n\\nMattis submitted his resignation on Dec. 20 after a series of policy disagreements with Trump, including the president's decision to withdraw troops from Syria. Mattis said he would stay until the end of February, but on Dec. 23 Trump announced that Shanahan would take over Jan. 1, speeding up Mattis' departure.\\n\\nIn his Cabinet meeting remarks with reporters present, Trump said he was in no rush to get U.S. troops out of Syria but did not clarify a timetable. Mattis and other Trump advisers tried unsuccessfully to persuade Trump to stay in Syria long enough to ensure that the Islamic State group, which has largely been defeated on the battlefield, cannot regroup. Nor did the president clarify plans in Afghanistan, where he has ordered a troop reduction on an unspecified timetable.\\n\\nShanahan, who had served as deputy to Mattis since July 2017, is a career business executive with no prior government or military experience. His views on alliance relations and other key defense issues are not well known. As the deputy secretary he had focused the budget as well as a Trump favorite topic: development of a Space Force.\\n\\nAt a morning meeting at the Pentagon with the military service secretaries and other top civilian officials, Shanahan said he was focused on the defense strategy developed during Mattis' tenure. It emphasizes the importance of great power competition with Russia and China, after America's many years of fighting insurgent wars in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn that context, Shanahan said the Pentagon leaders should remember, China, China, China, according to one official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss internal defense meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has had a rocky relationship with China. Like the Obama administration, Trump's government is concerned by what it calls China's militarization of disputed areas in the South China Sea and by its advances in certain high-tech weaponry.\\n\\nSeparately, Shanahan's spokesman, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said that as part of Shanahan's ethics agreement he had stepped aside himself for the duration of his service at the Pentagon from matters in which the Boeing Company is a party. Shanahan had worked for Boeing for 31 years, including in positions overseeing big defense programs. It's unclear whether Trump will nominate Shanahan for Senate confirmation as defense secretary or turn to another candidate.\\n\\nWith Shanahan moving up from deputy secretary to acting secretary, the Pentagon's budget chief, David Norquist, has been chosen to fill in temporarily as the deputy secretary, according to Pentagon spokesman Tom Crosson.\\n\\nShanahan, a native of Washington state, holds a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."}

Yet, they've all also used scientific arguments to justify their positions on climate change.\\n\\nMany Democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. It is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.\\n\\nIn New York, where Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and new Democratic majorities in the state Legislature are pushing for legalization, a recent proposal even espoused the laughable proposition that revenue generated by pot legalization could be used to fix the New York City subways.\\n\\nHowever, qualitative research has shown that for every dollar in revenue generated, marijuana legalization may cost taxpayers $10 in government spending and programs. Big Pot is a big loser for taxpayers.\\n\\nFor Democrats, supporting marijuana legalization is a way to mobilize young and minority voters. For all their charges that Republicans are in the pocket of Big Pharma, marijuana will become a booming industry that will endear many cannabis workers, investors and users of the drug to the Democratic Party and its candidates.\\n\\nSo the next time Democrats start talking about science, tell them that strong and reliable science and research don't just matter when they fit the Democratic agenda. Ask them to refute decades of medical research that demonstrate the real harm caused by marijuana.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TOM BASILE"}

Amirsedghi, who fled her country to escape persecution, said the way to save Iran, its people, its minorities and how to pacify the Middle East is only through the formation of an 'alliance of the willing' who would be willing to do everything in their power not only to support the democratic calls, [but also] calls for justice, prosperity and peace of the Iranians, if necessary militarily.\\n\\nThe mullahs have to go, she said.\\n\\nSaba Farzan, the German-Iranian executive director of Foreign Policy Circle, a strategy think tank in Berlin, told Fox News, The continued systematic persecution of Christians in Iran requires a tough response by the U.S. and its allies. Hard economic sanctions should be backed by a very visible campaign of naming and shaming the Iranian Islamic tyranny for denying its own citizens an absolute basic human right: freedom of religion. Especially the U.S. with its rich history of religious freedom and tolerance is seen by so many Iranians from all walks of life as a shining example. To back Iranian Christians is an important step to achieve freedom for all Iranians.\\n\\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nIran's foreign ministry in Tehran did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment.

{"original": "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blasted wokeness during a Monday speech in which he defended recent changes at government-funded international broadcaster Voice of America, where a Trump-backed overhaul has drawn criticism in recent months.\\n\\nPompeo's address to VOA staff was broadcast live on the network, despite the objections of some staff members, who penned a letter to VOA head Michael Peck arguing the speech at the broadcaster's headquarters would amount to propaganda and endanger those who attended during the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nIn his remarks, Pompeo said the VOA had lost its commitment to its founding mission under past administrations and shifted toward broadcasts that were too often about demeaning America. He also addressed criticism from VOA employees, arguing that those who sought to block his speech from being broadcast live had a dangerous instinct toward censorship.\\n\\nCensorship, wokeness, political correctness, it all points in one direction – authoritarianism, cloaked as moral righteousness, Pompeo said. It's similar to what we're seeing at Twitter, and Facebook, and Apple, and on too many university campuses. This is not who we are, as Americans. It's not what Voice of America should be. It's time to put woke-ism to sleep.\\n\\nThe Trump administration has faced bipartisan criticism in recent months for changes instituted by Michael Pack, a right-leaning documentarian appointed as head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent of VOA.\\n\\nCritics say Pack has replaced top officials with Trump loyalists and forced a shift toward the promotion of U.S. foreign policy rather than independent journalism. In November, a federal judge ordered Pack to halt further personnel changes and attempts to intercede on editorial operations.\\n\\nPompeo argued that about 40 percent of VOA's workforce had been improperly vetted prior to Pack's tenure, and that the Trump administration was reorienting VOA back to its mission of truth and unbiased reporting.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe Trump Administration isn't trying to politicize these institutions, Pompeo said. We're trying to de-politicize them.\\n\\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has committed to review Pack's changes to the agency once he takes office.\\n\\nPompeo's speech marked his first public remarks since pro-Trump protestors stormed the Capitol in response to the effort by lawmakers to certify Biden's victory in the 2020 election. Democrats and some Republicans have accused Trump of instigating the riot.\\n\\nPompeo did not address the riot during his speech.

{"original": "The Supreme Court will allow the Trump administration to enforce, for now, its public charge immigration restriction, lifting a pair of preliminary injunctions issued by federal judges.\\n\\nThe Monday order followed a 5-4 split vote that divided the court's conservatives and liberals.\\n\\nAt issue is the administration's rule issued in August that would restrict immigrants entering the United States if the government believes they will rely on public assistance, such as housing or health care benefits. Lower federal courts had blocked the policy from being implemented while the issue is being litigated.\\n\\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION BOOSTS ABILITY TO DENY GREEN CARDS TO IMMIGRANTS USING WELFARE PROGRAMS\\n\\nAfter losing at the lower courts, the Justice Department asked the high court to intervene, allowing temporary enforcement until the issue is resolved on the merits. The states of Connecticut, Vermont, and New York, as well as New York City and immigrant rights groups, had brought the suit.\\n\\nThe Trump Justice Department has gone repeatedly to the Supreme Court to lift such court-ordered injunctions, bypassing the traditional appellate process.\\n\\nJustice Neil Gorsuch -- supported by Justice Clarence Thomas -- wrote a separate concurrence on Monday, criticizing the increased reliance on nationwide injunctions to block government policies.\\n\\nThe real problem here is the increasingly common practice of trial courts ordering relief that transcends the cases before them. Whether framed as injunctions of 'nationwide,' 'universal,' or 'cosmic' scope, these orders share the same basic flaw—they direct how the defendant must act toward persons who are not parties to the case, Gorsuch wrote.\\n\\nThe court's liberal justices, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, would have blocked the regulation's enforcement.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nWhile a public charge inadmissibility standard has long been part of U.S. immigration law, it had not been formally defined by statute. The rule, announced by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in August, defines a public charge as an immigrant who received one or more designated benefits for more than 12 months within a 36-month period.\\n\\nThe principle driving it is an old American value, and that's self-sufficiency, USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli told Fox News in an interview last year. It's a core principle -- the American Dream itself -- and it's one of the things that distinguishes us, and it's central to the legal history in the U.S. back into the 1800s.\\n\\nThose benefits that would be designated included Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), as well as most forms of Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. The rule expands the number of benefits that can be considered from interim guidance issued in 1999.\\n\\nThe public charge rule has faced fierce opposition from immigrant activists, as well as many Democrats -- who have opposed measures to limit welfare for immigrants, while also calling for the extension of various forms of government aid to illegal immigrants as well.\\n\\nThis policy is yet another way for the Trump administration to hurt immigrants, said Claudia Center, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Disability Rights Program, said Monday. It enshrines the false stereotype that people with disabilities do not contribute to our society. Families will suffer. Congress has repeatedly declared that disability discrimination violates federal law. This rule must be stopped.\\n\\nThe chairman of the Democratic National Committee, DNC Chair Tom Perez, slammed the ruling.\\n\\nIt's sickening to see the United States Supreme Court rubber-stamp Trump's extreme, anti-immigrant, xenophobic agenda, he said. The conservative justices of the court are allowing the Trump administration to penalize those seeking help and close the door on their aspirations to become a part of and give back to this country as American citizens or residents.\\n\\nThe case is Department of Homeland Security v. State of New York and Make the Road New York (19a785).\\n\\nFox News' Adam Shaw contributed to this report."}

But this week, Barr said Mr. Trump's comments and tweets about criminal cases make it impossible for him to do his job.\\n\\nMeanwhile, prosecutors dropped a tough sentencing recommendation for a long time Trump advisor Roger Stone, but decided not to pursue criminal charges against a favorite Trump target, former FBI official Andrew McCabe.\\n\\nIn a moment, we'll speak with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.\\n\\nBut first, let's bring in Mark Meredith, reporting from the president's retreat at Mar-a-Lago with the latest -- Mark.\\n\\nMARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, the White House as the president still has confidence and faith in his attorney general even has multiple congressional Democrats are calling for Bill Barr to resign, amid multiple controversies facing his department.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBARR: I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.\\n\\nMEREDITH: Attorney General Bill Barr is raising eyebrows for selecting an outside prosecutor to review the case against former national security advisor Michael Flynn.\\n\\nIn 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, recently asked to withdraw that plea and is still awaiting sentencing. Meantime, the Justice Department says it's no longer pursuing a case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\\n\\nANDREW MCCABE, FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR: It is an absolute disgrace that they took two years before they finally drew the obvious conclusion.\\n\\nMEREDITH: President Trump repeatedly criticized McCabe over his role in the Russia probe and tweeted Saturday that McCabe, quote, authorized media links to advance personal interest.\\n\\nLast week, the president praised the Justice Department for changing the way it's handling the case against former Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone was convicted in November on multiple counts of lying to Congress. Prosecutors plan to ask for a 7 to 9-year sentence, but senior Justice officials overruled their recommendation and planned to push for a shorter sentence.\\n\\nBARR: I have not discussed the Roger Stone case at the White House.\\n\\nMEREDITH: Democrats don't buy it and are calling for Barr to step down.\\n\\nWARREN: Everything that Bill Barr is about right now is just about loyalty to Donald Trump. And we just can't have that. He should not be the attorney general.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nMEREDITH: Barr will be forced to explain some of his decisions. He's expected to head up to the House Judiciary Committee for a hearing at the end of March -- Chris.\\n\\nWALLACE: Mark Meredith reporting from Mar-a-Lago -- Mark, thank you.\\n\\nAnd joining us now, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.\\n\\nWelcome back to FOX News Sunday.\\n\\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.\\n\\nWALLACE: What does the president think of the decision to drop the criminal investigation of former FBI official Andrew McCabe? Does he think that McCabe should be prosecuted?\\n\\nCONWAY: Well, the president recognizes, as many people do, that it feels like there's a two -- two-tiered criminal justice system. If your President Trump or people associated with him, this prosecution would have gone one way.\\n\\nFor you're someone like Andy McCabe, who wasn't just a garden-variety FBI agent just starting out, he was the number two and for a while the acting director of the whole FBI after Comey was fired. No one, including Andy McCabe, his FBI counsel, Lisa Page, familiar name, has denied that he lied, and he didn't lie once, he lied multiple times.\\n\\nWhat did he lie about? Well, on about October -- at the end of October, 2016, he authorized a leak to Devin Bartlett, then a reporter at The Wall Street Journal. And the leak was about the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.\\n\\nSo he authorizes the leak and then he lies about even knowing about the leak, then he is able to correct that on tape in and on the record, under oath interview in July --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCONWAY: This is important -- July 2017, and lies again.\\n\\nAnd so, this is somebody -- he will still be a serial liar whether he's prosecuted or not --\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, here, let's get to the bottom line, does the president think --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: -- does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened and he should be prosecuted?\\n\\nCONWAY: The president appreciates the fact that this Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr works on any number of issues at this White House that doesn't get any kind of coverage. Sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar --\\n\\nWALLACE: Please answer my question.\\n\\nCONWAY: -- trafficking drugs, humans and guns, for example. Any number of issues you work on with the Department of Justice, this is small potatoes. But people see it from what it is.\\n\\nWALLACE: The McCabe case is small potatoes?\\n\\nCONWAY: He is small potatoes. He will always be seen as a serial liar and a leaker, as will those who covered for him.\\n\\nAnd what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file FBI men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including Andy McCabe, who are at the top levels of the FBI in 2016 trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president.\\n\\nWALLACE: Simple question. Does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened?\\n\\nCONWAY: The president thinks that Andy McCabe should have been punished because he lied and he lied several times to the investigators and many people feel the same way.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK.\\n\\nCONWAY: I'm not going to spend a lot more of my life on Andy McCabe.\\n\\nWALLACE: OK, and I'm not going to spend anymore of this interview on that.\\n\\nAttorney General Barr said this week the president has never asked him to do anything in a criminal case. But Mr. Trump tweeted: This doesn't mean that I do not have as president the legal right to do so. I do. But I have so far chosen not to.\\n\\nWhat does the president think is his legal authority to intervene in criminal cases and to order who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted?\\n\\nCONWAY: He didn't say he's ordering who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted. Article II --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: I didn't say he didn't. I'm saying, what does he think is his authority?\\n\\nCONWAY: Article II provides our president, yes, ladies and gentlemen, including President Trump vast powers. And the president is making a point, and the Attorney General Bill Barr is backing him up on this, that he has not interfered in any criminal case.\\n\\nI know people who are trying to bully Bill Barr out of his job, like Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign is dwindling. She is practically disappearing as a viable candidate, so she's got to pick on Bill Barr.\\n\\nHe's not going to be bullied by people like Elizabeth Warren. Steve Cohen, the congressman who put a bucket of chicken (INAUDIBLE) didn't show up to the State of the Union.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: What does he think is his authority to get involved in criminal cases under Article II?\\n\\nCONWAY: The president could weigh in, but you see how the president weighs in. The president weighs into the whole world.\\n\\nHe didn't have a conversation with Bill Barr about the Roger Stone case. He had a conversation with the whole world. He put it, as he is want to do, on his Twitter feed, on social media. And he expresses himself, cuts at the middlemen -- I know the middlemen don't like that -- in the democratization of information where he tells everybody what he thinks it and a number of issues, including the Stone case.\\n\\nWALLACE: But Bill Barr -- wait a minute -- Bill Barr says that that kind of conversation, even if it's to the whole world, not getting on the phone with Bill Barr undercuts his authority and makes it impossible for him, Bill Barr, to do his job.\\n\\nListen to what Barr said in that interview with ABC. Here he is.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: If he were to say, you know, go investigate somebody because -- and you sense it's because they're political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Since Watergate, presidents have generally, perhaps not always, but generally stayed away from involvement in criminal investigations.\\n\\nWill Mr. Trump, going forward, respect Barr's request for him to stop commenting on current cases, whether it's -- whether it's in terms of on the air, you know, public statements, or tweets?\\n\\nCONWAY: Well, a couple things, very different to pick up the phone and ask your attorney general to do something in a criminal case, the president hasn't done that. He had -- he says he hasn't done it, Bill Barr said he hasn't done it, he hasn't done it.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: But Barr said the tweets are making it impossible to do his job.\\n\\nCONWAY: But no -- and let me say something. It's not correct to say that presidents have not interfered. Bill Clinton pardoned a relative. He pardoned someone who refused to testify against him, that's involving yourself in criminal matters --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Wait, pardoning is different. Wait. It's different, it's after the criminal process has been completed and clearly the --\\n\\nCONWAY: President Obama spoke up in the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. President George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41, I think commented on the case in L.A., probably the Rodney King case.\\n\\nSo, it's not -- it's disingenuous to say that people -- presidents don't comment on criminal matters.\\n\\nWhat is most important here -- two things, one is the president of the United States has not asked or directed his attorney general privately to do anything in any criminal matter including Roger Stone. Number two, he works hand and glove with the attorney general, as we all are privileged to do on a number of matters that affect this country. I --\\n\\nWALLACE: Policy is different than criminal cases. Policy is different than criminal cases.\\n\\nCONWAY: No policy -- well, the attorney general and Department of Justice cover a lot of territory in this country, Chris --\\n\\nWALLACE: OK.\\n\\nCONWAY: -- and we work very well with them.\\n\\nAgain, let me repeat, drug trafficking, human trafficking, gun trafficking, sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar, eldercare now we do (ph), elder fraud we're doing.\\n\\nI just went to something about law enforcement, a new commission they have. Our law enforcement feel more deeply respected and better resourced because of Donald Trump and Bill Barr.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Can you and I talk about Michael -- can we talk about Michael Bloomberg?\\n\\nCONWAY: Sure.\\n\\nWALLACE: There's been a war of --\\n\\nCONWAY: Speaking of purity\\n\\nWALLACE: There's been a war of words over the past week certainly between the president and former New York City --\\n\\nCONWAY: But the war of words is between Michael Bloomberg and the African- American community.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well --\\n\\nCONWAY: The way he feels about people is so demeaning. The policy may have been stop-and-frisk, but the philosophy was to castigate and denigrate people of color and it's a disgrace.\\n\\nWALLACE: You were -- you've anticipated where we're going to go because one of the statements back and forth had to do with these comments that Michael Bloomberg made about stop and frisk in 2015. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, FEBRUARY 5, 2015)\\n\\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: The way you should get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.\\n\\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: The president tweeted right after that came out: Wow, Bloomberg is a total racist, and he expanded on that in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera.\\n\\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\\n\\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You couldn't go to your house. They were stopping you every day. What Bloomberg did to black -- to the black community was a disgrace.\\n\\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: But, Kellyanne, candidate Donald Trump supported what Bloomberg did with stop-and-frisk. Here he is in the first debate in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nTRUMP: It was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg, and it was terminated by a current mayor. But stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: So why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?\\n\\nCONWAY: Well, he is -- the president is toying with everybody by saying, oh, had he said something like that, had you unearthed a videotape like that of him, everybody would say racist, racist.\\n\\nBut look at all the people who were saying, you know what, I think Michael Bloomberg learned his lesson, he's apologized, that was so long ago. Chris, it was a few years ago as mayor of New York. And it wasn't just stop-and- frisk. He said redlining -- canceling redlining started the financial crisis.\\n\\nThe African-American community weren't the perpetrators of that financial crisis, many of them were the victims. What is he talking about?\\n\\nThis billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that Michael Bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at Woodstock when he was a teenager. He said these several years ago, a few short years ago as mayor of New York and it's the way he said it.\\n\\nHe said, you can basically Xerox the description of male minorities between the ages of 16 and 25, and hand it over to the cops.\\n\\nThat is somebody who looks at people beneath him differently and we can't have that. And I -- I cannot -- I literally this week -- I got pretty big shock absorbers, my friend, I cannot believe all the prominent African- Americans I've seen publicly say, I think we can support Bloomberg because after all, he's electable, he's the one who can beat Donald Trump.\\n\\nElectability was the calling card for Hillary Clinton four years ago, for Joe Biden this entire year. Electability means nothing if the person looks at a large constituency of your electorate, let alone this country that -- wait, look what he said about women. I mean, all this coming out, women and lawsuits --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Let me ask about women, because there's a long story in The Washington Post today.\\n\\nCONWAY: Read it.\\n\\nWALLACE: I did read it.\\n\\nCONWAY: I did too\\n\\nWALLACE: OK. About Bloomberg's history of sexist comments, about women who work for him at his company.\\n\\nCan -- will President Trump, if it's a Bloomberg-Trump race, will he be able to make an issue of that given President Trump's own long history of sexist comments?\\n\\nCONWAY: It should be an issue here and now, today. You don't have to wait for an election to be offended by the fact that Michael Bloomberg, according to other Bloomberg employees, said to a woman who announced she was pregnant, she's been congratulated by her coworkers, says, aren't you going to kill it?\\n\\nThis is a woman who relied upon her employment, relied upon Michael Bloomberg for employment, and one would imagine her maternity benefits as she found out the good news. The comments he's made about women -- I mean, The Washington Post had to bleep out some of the actual words.\\n\\nThe comments he's made about women in lawsuits, that is all fair game. And it's fair game because we want to know the person behind the half a billion dollars worth of ads --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: But is it fair game for President Trump when he's made sexist comments too?\\n\\nCONWAY: Oh, please. First of all, I've been working by his side for four years. He's the best boss I've ever had.\\n\\nWALLACE: There are plenty women who would say the same thing about Michael Bloomberg.\\n\\nCONWAY: Let them come forward.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Is this any worse -- is this any worse than the Access Hollywood tapes?\\n\\nCONWAY: It's far worse. Oh, my goodness, it's far worse. And, by the way, that was fully litigated. That happened in October 7th. He won a month a later. And --\\n\\nWALLACE: That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean it's not an issue.\\n\\nNo, here's -- if you're going to do that -- you know what? I'll take that on any time. I'll take a leave of absence from the White House and talk all day long about that stuff.\\n\\nLet me tell you something: the way Michael Bloomberg treated employees, female employees who were under his wing, who were relying on him for their -- for their livelihood, for their health benefits, for their 401(k)s, to have created that kind of culture, that unsafe workplace, to feel that you're being harassed because of your gender, that is problematic, and I think you're going to hear more of it.\\n\\nThe other thing is, I don't understand how the Democratic Party is going to sit back and take it. Is it really worth it to this Democratic Party in the age of the #metoo movement, Black Lives Matter, you had the first African- American president, you have completely squeezed out and spat out the candidates of color this time, Cory Booker. Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, they are out of the race. You're left -- you're left with a bunch of white people, old white people at that with the exception of your next guest, Mayor Buttigieg, and you're going to go backwards because Michael Bloomberg will spend money and will take and will consult Donald Trump?\\n\\nThat's why the Bernie voters are not going to take that. I predict. He'll keep winning contests. He's like President Trump in that he's got a committed base of loyal voters who aren't going to go elsewhere.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Thank you very much.\\n\\nCONWAY: Voters care about what affects them --\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nWALLACE: We'll pass your comments later to the Democratic candidates, I'm sure they'll be happy to hear them.\\n\\nCONWAY: Voters talk about what offends them, but they vote on what affects them. And they have a big decision to make. If you want -- if you want to elevate somebody who has treated people that are less than him, people of color and women, that's a big decision to make. It's a serious consequence in 2020 when our country has such great progress. This president has --\\n\\nWALLACE: OK, we're done. Timeout.\\n\\n(CROSSTALK)\\n\\nCONWAY: -- African-Americans out of jobs (ph) and now out of prison --\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Kellyanne Conway, thank you. Always good to talk with you.\\n\\nCONWAY: You got it. Thank you.\\n\\nWALLACE: Wish (ph) you could be talking to the commercial.\\n\\nCONWAY: I'll be back.\\n\\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the new tension between President Trump and his attorney general.\\n\\nPlus, what would you like us the panel about Democrats' calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBARR: I cannot do my job here at the department with constant background commentary that undercuts me.\\n\\nMCCABE: We are seeing things happen every day in this country that many of us never, ever thought we'd see here -- the pursuit of political enemies and the use of the criminal justice system.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Attorney General Barr and former FBI official Andrew McCabe finding one thing they can agree on as both complain about President Trump weighing in on Justice Department investigations.\\n\\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group.\\n\\nGuy Benson of FOX News Radio; Charles Lane from The Washington Post; former DNC chair, Donna Brazile; and former Trump National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton.\\n\\nMichael, let me start with you. You now have the attorney general calling on the president to stop commenting on criminal cases.\\n\\nShould the president listen to Bill Barr, will he listen to Bill Barr?\\n\\nMICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, look, I think he should listen to Bill Barr. The president obviously has confidence in Bill Barr. He appointed him.\\n\\nHe has said over the weekend that, you know, he was asked, does this mean there's a rift? Would seem that he had a rift with his prior attorney general and he said, no. So, I think he should listen.\\n\\nBut I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.\\n\\nSo, I take Bill Barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.\\n\\nSo, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. But the fact of the matter is I think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.\\n\\nWALLACE: Good luck with getting him to back off on the tweets.\\n\\nWe asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of Democratic calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice, we got this on Facebook from Mark Davis.\\n\\nHow can you interfere in an organization you oversee? It's rhetorical. You can't.\\n\\nChuck, as I discussed with Kellyanne, under Article Two, the president has tremendous powers to oversee the Justice Department and specifically criminal investigations. So how do you answer Mark?\\n\\nCHUCK LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: It's a fair question. There is a paradox built into our constitutional order.\\n\\nThe president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.\\n\\nHere we have a president who doesn't really I think even know about it, and flouts it through social media, broadcasting his desire to see this or that person benefited by justice, somebody else should go to jail, and that, as Bill Barr said is totally threatening to that norm.\\n\\nBut he does it because the base loves it. I'm not even sure he really wants these threats and orders carried out, but the base loves it and that is why he will keep doing it.\\n\\nWALLACE: Meanwhile, Democrats are now calling for an investigation of Attorney General Barr. Or even more. Take a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWARREN: What the attorney general has done, we should all be calling for the resignation of the attorney general. If he won't resign, remember, the attorney general can be impeached.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Donna, haven't Democrats learned their lesson? Move on from impeachment and investigations?\\n\\nDONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR: Has President Trump learned in any lesson over the last couple of months? He's on a retribution tour. He's on a revenge tour.\\n\\nWhen career professionals walk out of their job, we all should take notice. What happened?\\n\\nWhen the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, the largest U.S. attorney office, is removed and then a replacement is putting in, and then the sentencing charges are either meddled with -- yes, there needs to be a comprehensive investigation as to what is happening.\\n\\nI want to mention something, Kellyanne talked about George Herbert Walker Bush in the Rodney King case, as well as Barack Obama in the Freddie --\\n\\nWALLACE: Gray case.\\n\\nBRAZILE: -- Gray case.\\n\\nIn both instances, the communities erupted because they were concerned about overzealous policing and what happened in those cases. That's what they got involved.\\n\\nThey didn't get in -- they didn't try to tip the scales of justice. They were trying to calm the community after, you know, two very horrific things occurred. So, we shouldn't put the two together.\\n\\nBut the president's -- what he's doing with his tweets, he's revealing what's going on in the Justice Department. And I think the House should get to the bottom of it.\\n\\nWALLACE: Guy, first of all, your reaction to Donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? Do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general? Or is it a bit of theater as some people have suggested, where Barr is saying this because he needs to shore up his position at the Justice Department and there's kind of an inside agreement, tacit agreement between the White House and Justice?\\n\\nGUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. I would also note, that President Obama did make public comments about the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from Rodney King, right? So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.\\n\\nOn this broader issue of Barr and the Democratic reaction, I think your question was good. Have the Democrats learned their lesson? We have people talking about impeachment of Bill Barr, which I think is ludicrous.\\n\\nWe have heard over and over again from Democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to President Trump? Why won't any of his people stand up to President Trump? Then Bill Barr does that with a brush back pitch that I think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.\\n\\nI'm not sure I would call it a rift, but between Bill Barr saying what he said on ABC News, and then his Justice Department declining to prosecute Andrew McCabe, an outcome that I think it's very clear the president wants, to Michael's point -- I think it's been about few days for the narrative that Bill Barr is just a hatchet man for President Trump who will do his bidding.\\n\\nWALLACE: So what to expect? Do you -- I mean, going forward you expect the president to stay out of these cases?\\n\\nBENSON: No.\\n\\nWALLACE: No?\\n\\nBENSON: No, he'll tweet. There's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less. I think that Mitch McConnell sat in the studio, the Senate majority leader, just a few days ago and urge the president to take the advice of his attorney general. I hope the president does it, even if he just calibrates it slightly differently.\\n\\nWhat will be interesting is if Trump dials it up and continues to do this even more aggressively, what does Barr do then? Having lay down a marker on this point?\\n\\nWALLACE: All right. Panel, we have to take a break here.\\n\\nBut up next, one of the Democratic front runners, Pete Buttigieg, joins us to discuss the upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, and whether he can build on his early momentum straight through Super Tuesday.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: Coming up, Bernie Sanders' win in New Hampshire put new pressure on Democrats fighting to be the moderate candidate in the race for the White House.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: A fresh outlook is what makes new beginnings possible. It is how we build a new majority.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: We'll ask Pete Buttigieg how he plans to stand out in the crowded center.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: The Democratic race for the White House is gearing up with the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire starting to winnow the field of candidates and establish new frontrunners, but upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, much more diverse states, could reshuffle the race again.\\n\\nJoining us now from Las Vegas, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\\n\\nMayor, let's start with the numbers from the two states which are going to be holding contests over the next few weeks, put them up on the screen. In Nevada, you're in fifth place with 10 percent support. In South Carolina, you're also in fifth place with 7.5 percent support. You're trailing Tom Steyer in both states.\\n\\nHow important is it for you to do well, much better than those numbers, in both of those states to show that you can get support in states with a big minority voting bloc?\\n\\nPETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it's very important for us to do well, and we're on the ground working to earn those good results here in Nevada and we'll be campaigning hard for every vote in South Carolina as well.\\n\\nWe've see how fluid it is. Of course I don't have billions of dollars of my own money to pour into the airwaves. But what we do have is a vision that as we've demonstrated in New Hampshire and Iowa, can bring people together in a commitment, as we come to more racially diverse states to speak to the concerns of voters who are here.\\n\\nHere in Nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow Nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where I'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.\\n\\nThis is a state that is in many ways reflective of the future of America and I'm really excited to be on the ground here working to earn that support in the week that remains.\\n\\nWALLACE: How damaging, if you don't show strong support among Latinos in Nevada, African-Americans in South Carolina -- because that question of whether or not you can get support from those minorities, of course, is the big knock on your campaign?\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I'll leave it to pundits due to the political analysis.\\n\\nWhat I will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. And when you look at the way that Latino voters here in Nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to Washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump. We are ready to go out and have that conversation.\\n\\nYou know, this, more than anything else, I think for so many voters and certainly a lot of voters that -- of color that I talked to across the Latino, the black in the AEPi (ph) communities is about making sure that we get this right.\\n\\nYou know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.\\n\\nWALLACE: I want to talk about how this race is beginning to shape up because after Tuesday it is beginning to shape up.\\n\\nIn New Hampshire, the so-called moderate candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote of voters in that state, but -- which was double what Bernie Sanders got, but he won in New Hampshire because he had that left lane, the more liberal lane, all to himself while the so-called more moderate lane was kind of clogged up by you and -- and Biden and Klobuchar, all of whom split up the votes.\\n\\nHow concerned are you that the -- that the moderate lane, if you will, is getting so crowded that you could be leaving the -- the road to the nomination open to Bernie Sanders?\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. Look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. But the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to Washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.\\n\\nWe've been able to demonstrate our ability to get diehard Democrats, yes, but also independents and even some Republicans to cross over a support my vision and what our campaign stands for. And I believe that's going to serve us well here in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond.\\n\\nWALLACE: And then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on Super Tuesday you face another centrist candidate in Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, a big story in The Washington Post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.\\n\\nHow troubled are you by these allegations and this evidence of alleged sexism and racism?\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I think he's going to have to answer for that and speak to it.\\n\\nLook, this is a time where voters are looking for a president who can lead us out of the days when it was just commonplace, or accepted to have these kinds of sexist and discriminatory attitudes. And, you know, right now, this is our chance to do something different.\\n\\nObviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.\\n\\nLook, some of these are issues that our country's about to face are among the most intractable we've ever had, but you've got to arrive at those -- at those challenges with -- with the ability to explain your record and with an ability to explain how you're going to raise the bar at a time when we are finally asking a lot more from our elected leaders.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, let me follow up on that because Kellyanne Conway was, I think, trolling Democrats and saying, boy, this part that talks about all of these principles in the Me Too era, are they going to nominate somebody like Michael Bloomberg with his record of things he's done, for instance, towards women in the workplace, just because they think he can beat Donald Trump? What would that say about what the Democratic Party really stands for?\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: For a representative of this White House to speak about misogyny, to speak about sexism, to speak about racism is comical. And, you're right, I think it amounts to trolling.\\n\\nLook, the American people are not going to be fooled by anybody from the Trump White House when it comes to these issues. So I'll leave it to my competitors in this race to speak for themselves, but one thing we can all agree on is that we can do a lot better than this president.\\n\\nAnd, you know, one of the reasons why I'm seeing a lot of folks from the Republican Party or formally from the Republican Party ready to cross over is that they can no longer look their children in the eye and explain the behavior of the current president of the United States.\\n\\nWALLACE: Mayor, you have been very open about the fact that you're gay. And it hasn't been much of an issue in this campaign until now. This week, two conservative supporters of President Trump, Rush Limbaugh and Sebastian Gorka, talked about it on their shows.\\n\\nTake a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: A gay guy, 37 years old, loves kissing his husband on debate stages. Can you see Trump have fun with that?\\n\\nSEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Why is a homosexual man lecturing us about the sanctity of life in the womb? Just a little curious there. Strange.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Mayor, what's your reaction to those comments?\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I am in a faithful, loving, committed marriage. I'm -- I'm proud of my marriage. And I'm proud of my husband. And I'm not going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh or anybody who supports Donald J. Trump as the moral as well as political leader of the United States.\\n\\nAmerica has moved on and we should have politics of belonging that welcomes everybody. That's what the American people are for. And I am saddened for what the Republican Party has become if they embrace that kind of homophobic rhetoric.\\n\\nWALLACE: And how big an issue do you think this would be in a general election? Clearly they think it would be an issue. The idea that -- that you would need -- and you have reached out to social conservatives, many of whose votes you'd need -- but who might have concerns about your sexual orientation?\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, here's my generational -- or general election experience on this. You know, I came out during a general election in south Bend. And this was at a time when Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana. And we didn't know what would happen.\\n\\nI'll tell you what happened, I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally Democratic, but socially conservative community. More than I had the first time that I ran for office.\\n\\nThis election isn't about any of us candidates. It is about voters' lives. And we're the ones trying to get voters a raise. We're the ones trying to make sure that there is paid family leave, working to end endless war, serious about climate change --\\n\\nWALLACE: Right.\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Actually prepared to do something on gun violence.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to LGBTQ issues, this is, I think, the most important thing is not the treatment of candidates, it's what's happening to individuals and families across the country from brave service members who have their careers threatened --\\n\\nWALLACE: Right.\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: By this president, two kids experiencing bullying right now in this climate. We can do better and you don't have to be a diehard Democrat to know that we can do better when it comes to inclusion and equality in this country.\\n\\nWALLACE: Mayor, thank you. Thanks for joining us. We'll be watching developments next week out of Nevada.\\n\\nGood to have you.\\n\\nBUTTIGIEG: Thanks. Good to be with you.\\n\\nWALLACE: When we come back, as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg rises in the polls, troubling comments from his past are resurfacing. The Sunday panel will tackle that, next.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He sees our poll numbers and I think it's fair to say he is scared because he knows I have the record and the resources to defeat him.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Mike Bloomberg reacting to President Trump's barrage of attacks this week, but the former New York City mayor also facing incoming about his long record in public life.\\n\\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\\n\\nDonna, as we've been saying, Mayor Bloomberg rising in the polls, news stories coming out, old tapes coming out about his record on race and, as we've said several times, a -- a big story, a takeout in The Washington Post today about his -- and you can see it there, about his long history of sexist comments going back decades at his company and women saying that they believed he created a hostile workplace.\\n\\nHow damaging to his campaign?\\n\\nDONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Extremely.\\n\\nLook, I think there are many people in the Democratic Party who are looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. But the question in my judgment is his record. I mean, I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he's apologized. I get that. I'm for forgiveness. But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.\\n\\nYou know, it's one thing to have this so-called top law enforcement policy of stop and frisk. It was ruled unconstitutional. And it has taken him years to say I'm sorry about that. He has the -- he has the resources, but I'm -- I am very uncomfortable with -- with his record. Very comfortable.\\n\\nWALLACE: Guy, you could tell that Kellyanne Conway was thoroughly enjoying the predicament, not just for Bloomberg, but for the Democratic Party.\\n\\nCan they nominate -- will they perhaps nominate someone who's got Bloomberg's record? And we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in New York, crime did go down. He's given tremendous amounts of money on a lot of issues that Democrats like, climate change, a lot of women's groups. Can, in the Me Too era, the Democratic Party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?\\n\\nGUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.\\n\\nWALLACE: Then there is -- I guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, Joe Biden, who took it drubbing in Iowa, an even worse drubbing in New Hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, Latinos, African-Americans in South Carolina and Nevada, to -- to rescue him.\\n\\nTake a look.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've said many times, you can't be the Democratic nominee and you can't win a general election as a Democrat unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters.\\n\\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\\n\\nWALLACE: Chuck, how much trouble is Biden in with the performance in those other states? Even his one-time overwhelming lead in South Carolina is now beginning to slip away.\\n\\nCHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. And let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if Biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. And he, so far, has not delivered.\\n\\nSouth Carolina, with its large base of African-American voters is and was his firewall and it will be tested now in a way that is vital to the future of his candidacy.\\n\\nYou know, he is not that strong among Latino voters. It's Bernie Sanders who seems to be polling among Latino voters in Nevada, which only heightens the importance of South Carolina. If Biden goes down and we're left with this sort of spread of several candidates, none of whom with a clear majority, then you could be looking at somebody -- or the primary season ending with no one having a majority and then things get really complicated.\\n\\nWALLACE: No, they get really great because you're talking about a brokered convention, which all of us have been looking towards for our entire political lives.\\n\\nBut, you know, let me pick up with you, Michael, on the point I was making with Mayor Buttigieg. You've got Bernie Sanders over here on the left and with Elizabeth Warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path. And, meanwhile, you've got this center lane all clogged up with Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Biden and Bloomberg about to get into it.\\n\\nHow well is this setting up for Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee?\\n\\nMICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.\\n\\nSo that lane remains clogged up. I think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the Democratic nomination. Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.\\n\\nWALLACE: Donna?\\n\\nBRAZILE: Well, the race is far from over. And I know everyone is focused on the four states that ultimately help us to winnow the field.\\n\\nThe field has been whittled. And I think what we're left with now is not just left versus right, we're trying to make sure that we elect someone who will give us the kind of country that we deserve, not someone like Donald Trump. And, therefore, it is clogged. It is clogged.\\n\\nBut I do believe that we are going to see a clarifying moment that occurs over the next two weeks. And by the time we get to super Tuesday -- I've been to four of the Super Tuesday states. Let me just tell you, Michael Bloomberg is dominating the airwaves. But you're right, I don't know where the energy is on the ground for Michael Bloomberg, but he is dominating the airwaves.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Chris, we're going to have a nominee by the end of March.\\n\\nWALLACE: By the end of March?\\n\\nBRAZILE: Yes.\\n\\nWALLACE: No -- no brokered convention?\\n\\nBRAZILE: Sixty -- 60 percent of the delegates. We're going to have a clear shot at figuring out where the last two or three candidates will be. Yes, we're going to have a nominee.\\n\\nWALLACE: And -- and in 30 seconds, is Bernie Sanders a suicide pact?\\n\\nBRAZILE: Bernie Sanders is a strong, viable candidate with a lot of support out there.\\n\\nWALLACE: So you think you could legitimately beat Donald Trump?\\n\\nBRAZILE: I'm not there yet because I -- I'm not sure he's going to be the nominee.\\n\\nWALLACE: No, but I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you --\\n\\nBRAZILE: Don't try to get me in trouble on a Sunday (ph).\\n\\nWALLACE: That's my job.\\n\\nBRAZILE: I should be a mess right now.\\n\\nWALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you Sunday.\\n\\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week. He is known for merging punk with piano. Now he's trying to bring a new union between classical and pop.\\n\\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\\n\\nWALLACE: It's a constant test for symphony orchestra's, how to bring in fresh ideas and fans without alienating the diehards. Well now the guy who brought piano to the punk scene is taking on that challenge. He's our Power Player of the Week.\\n\\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nBEN FOLDS, MUSICIAN AND AUTHOR: Because there seems to be a hierarchy, which you would think exists where the symphony is the great thing and the -- the -- the rockers of the dumb ones. But it's not that simple and each have something to offer the other.\\n\\nWALLACE (voice over): Ben Folds is all about breaking down barriers. Musical barriers between pop and classical.\\n\\nAs artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, his late night sold out declassified concerts are the platform for his special mix.\\n\\nFOLDS: It's about unformalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people. People go to the symphony and they think, oh, how do I dress? They don't even know. So, you know, we make it informal in a way for them to feel comfortable to be there.\\n\\nThe next artist that you're about to hear, I just discovered her on YouTube.\\n\\nWALLACE: He took us backstage as he oversaw his classical pop matchup. Folds admits it can be an uneasy balance.\\n\\nFOLDS: Orchestral musicians are demoralized by loud music that covers up what they normally do. They're having to do a dumbed down version of it. The rock band goes out thinking, wow, that wasn't loud enough, didn't feel it.\\n\\nWALLACE: Declassified as a means of de-confliction, and it's working.\\n\\nFOLDS: We've sold out every show we've -- we've done here. People have walked away with a Spotify playlist of classical music, which we can see that they are listening to.\\n\\nWALLACE: He's been blending genres since the '90s, when he started Ben Folds Five, which hit the charts with the ballad Brick.\\n\\nFOLDS: She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly.\\n\\nWALLACE (on camera): No guitar?\\n\\nFOLDS: No guitar. No. In an -- in an era that was all about the guitar. That was the grunge era.\\n\\nWALLACE: You called it punk rock for sissies.\\n\\nFOLDS: Yes, maybe nerds would have been a little better word.\\n\\nI realized that everyone could relate to piano music, but it just wasn't cool at the moment.\\n\\nWALLACE: Walk us through, when you're sitting at a piano, how you come up with an idea.\\n\\nFOLDS: I don't know. You know, like I'm -- if I was going to say, hello, Chris Wallace, you know, then I find it. So it would be, hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today. You know, like then I would -- I would find it on the piano.\\n\\nWALLACE: That's the Chris Wallace song?\\n\\nFOLDS: That's the Chris Wallace song.\\n\\nWALLACE: Well, let -- let me hear that again.\\n\\nFOLDS: Here's the happy version. Hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today? We make it minor and it becomes sad because he has more work to do.\\n\\nYou know, I just -- you find it.\\n\\nWALLACE: I love that.\\n\\nWALLACE: (voice over): Folds shares his creative process in this memoir. The title refers to a childhood dream where he spread joy by catching lightning bugs for others.\\n\\nFOLDS: As an artist, what I do is I capture the thing that I see, the thing that interests me. My job is putting that idea in a bottle, which I've taken my whole life to do, and to share that with other people.\\n\\nWALLACE: He's still sharing his lightning bugs and spreading joy.\\n\\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\\n\\nWALLACE: Folds is also an advocate for music education. His next project is a show with The Mister Rogers Foundation, writing songs with kids.\\n\\nAnd that's it for today.

{"original": "In God we Trust will be the new standard on Mississippi license plates beginning this month. It will replace the design featuring blues legend B.B. King.\\n\\nThe new design also features the state seal and the phrase The Great Seal of the State of Mississippi.\\n\\nMississippi Gov. Phil Bryant made the announcement last year in May.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nI was proud to sign legislation in 2014 that added the United States National Motto, In God We Trust, to the Mississippi State Seal, Bryant wrote on Twitter. Today, I am equally delighted to announce that it will adorn our new Mississippi license plates...available starting in January 2019.\\n\\nThe move has drawn mixed reviews.\\n\\nJon Pritchett, president of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy, defended the plates as constitutional.\\n\\nWe have been misinformed and misled by generations of public policy, education, and media leaders on the so-called 'separation of church and state,' Pritchett wrote. The concept has been so pervasive that we generally accept the idea that it is inappropriate to bring any faith-based ideas to the public square. The idea that we should separate religion — of any faith or denomination — from politics is not only false, it is virtually impossible.\\n\\nTEXAS COUPLE: GOD 'PURPOSEFULLY CONNECTED' US TO KIDS FOUND CHAINED IN HORRIFIC ABUSE CASE\\n\\nBut the American Humanist Association, or AHA, disagrees, blasting the new plates as unconstitutional.\\n\\nUnlike the use of 'In God We Trust' on money, which is only visible if one makes an affirmative effort to read it, the larger public display of 'In God We Trust' on motor vehicles, alongside bumper stickers and other signage, more clearly makes a statement endorsing the theistic assumptions underlying the phrase, AHA said. The problem, obviously, is that many individuals do not believe in a God, let alone trust in him, her, or it.\\n\\nStates where people can get In God We Trust as specialty plates, by paying an additional fee, include: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin."}
{"original": "Voters in Georgia are headed to the polls on Tuesday for the culmination of a very long election year, casting the ballots that will decide the control of the U.S. Senate for at least the next two years.\\n\\nAfter no candidate in either of Georgia's two U.S. Senate elections got more than 50% of the vote on Nov. 3, the top two candidates in each race moved on to the Jan. 5 runoffs. Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler is facing Democrat Raphael Warnock for her seat. Meanwhile, Republican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired on Sunday, is fighting to retain his seat against Democrat Jon Ossoff.\\n\\nTypically, voters are not in the position to know whether their senators or members of Congress will control the balance of power in either chamber when they cast their votes. There are usually too many states and too many possible outcomes for that.\\n\\nNot in this case. Republicans gained control of 50 Senate seats in November while Democrats won the presidency and the vice presidency, leaving up for grabs just Georgia's two Senate seats.\\n\\nIf Republicans win even one of the Georgia races, they'll hold a Senate majority for the next two years and have an effective veto over President-elect Joe Biden's agenda. If Democrats sweep both races, however, the Senate will be at an effective 50-50 tie on party lines. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would then be able to break ties on party-line votes.\\n\\nGEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS BRINGING ON A 'GREAT DEAL OF URGENCY' AMONG DEMS: STACEY ABRAMS\\n\\nThe candidates themselves have made the stakes of the election clear, with Ossoff saying he plans to take power away from Mitch McConnell and Loeffler emphasizing that everything is on the line in Georgia.\\n\\nIt really feels like we're at the center of the political universe and will be until Jan. 5, Maria Saporta, the chair of the Atlanta Press Club Debate Committee, told Fox News before the debate between Loeffler and Warnock in early December.\\n\\nFox News Channel and FoxNews.com will cover the results of the runoff elections in real time Tuesday, with pivotal analysis, context and perspective.\\n\\nHere's what to know about the Georgia runoffs.\\n\\nThey've been expensive\\n\\nThe Georgia runoffs have been some of the most expensive two months of nonpresidential politics in American history. The total ad spending in the race has reached nearly $500 million.\\n\\nTo put that in perspective, that's about the amount of spending of an average presidential campaign.\\n\\nThe 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign spent nearly $450 million. The 2016 Hillary Clinton campaign spent about $585 million. The Trump 2020 campaign spent just under $775 million, which is similar to what both Obama campaigns spent.\\n\\nBut the Georgia spending is all concentrated in one state, over the course of two months.\\n\\nPERDUE ON GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS: TRUMP RIGHT THAT 'SOMETHING UNTOWARD' HAPPENED IN ELECTION\\n\\nVeteran Georgia-based Republican consultant Chip Lake told FOX Business that the astronomical ad spending's unlike anything I've ever seen because it's so sustained. Every week since Thanksgiving has been what the last week before a general election normally is.\\n\\nNotably, the approximately $500 million total does not include get-out-the-vote efforts by campaigns and parties. So the actual total is higher.\\n\\nPoll closing time\\n\\nPolls in Georgia close at 7 p.m. That means voters who are in line by that time can vote. Voters may also drop their absentee ballots off at a drop box by 7 p.m.\\n\\nTurnout is key\\n\\nThere has been very little in the way of efforts to persuade voters in Georgia to vote for one side or the other, or to convince independents to come to one side or the other from the middle.\\n\\nLike the presidential election, the Georgia runoffs are turnout elections, with each side running constant negative ads against the other and making efforts to energize their base.\\n\\nWe don't go in to register voters or to convince anybody there, we just want to be sure that we get our people out to vote, Joan Reynolds, the chair of the Mighty Alabama Strike Force, which has had volunteers in Georgia since November, told Fox News in an interview.\\n\\nLOEFFLER VS. WARNOCK ON HEALTH CARE: WHERE THEY STAND\\n\\nThe various campaigns and a bevy of other outside groups have taken that approach to the runoffs as well.\\n\\nThat means how many voters show up to the polls and where it is they show up will be key for Democrats and Republicans. Democrats tend to vote by mail and vote early more than Republicans, and that is showing up in the numbers of votes reported so far.\\n\\nIf rural, more conservative areas see a large surge in turnout on Election Day, then that will be a key for Loeffler and Perdue to win. If the turnout among those groups is closer to that of urban areas, it will be a good sign for Ossoff and Warnock as they will likely lead in votes not cast on Election Day.\\n\\nResults may take time\\n\\nGeorgia was one of several states where it took multiple days to count ballots during the general election. This was because of a combination of the large volume of people voting absentee -- those ballots are more physically demanding to count than standard ballots -- and the close margin of the presidential race.\\n\\nPERDUE VS. OSSOFF ON HEALTH CARE: WHERE THEY STAND\\n\\nBoth Georgia runoffs are likely to be close as well, so there may not be a clear winner on election night.\\n\\nEveryone's interested\\n\\nPresident Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Biden all rallied in Georgia on Monday. Harris rallied in Georgia Sunday.\\n\\nThe campaigns have been supported by a who's who of high-profile politicians on each side, including Sens. Rick Scott, R-Fla.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Biden transportation secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg and more.\\n\\nA number of Hollywood stars have also backed the Democrats. Meanwhile, singer Lee Greenwood played in Georgia at an event supporting Perdue and Loeffler.\\n\\nBiden agenda at stake\\n\\nThe Senate majority will play a major role in the upcoming two years. Biden's agenda, among other things, includes a public health insurance option, rolling back the 2017 tax cuts, further coronavirus aid, rolling back Trump immigration policies and other executive orders, and ambitious environmental programs.\\n\\nAs president, Biden will also have the opportunity to appoint federal judges, including Supreme Court justices. He can also pick crucial executive appointees who will shape federal policy.\\n\\nA Republican-controlled Senate could stand in the way of many of those priorities, forcing Biden to moderate his policies so they are able to make it through the Senate.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nMany Democrats have also promoted policies like the Green New Deal, court-packing and ending the legislative filibuster. These would likely have a hard time even under a Democrat-controlled Senate, as moderate Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia has said he will not abide by such ideas, sparking a public feud with Ocasio-Cortez.\\n\\nBut David McIntosh, the president of the conservative Club for Growth, which has campaigned for Loeffler and Perdue, said he does not trust Manchin to be a buffer in that situation.\\n\\nYou've got to worry about it, right, because if he's the sole guy stopping them, the pressure on him from his friends and former allies is going to be enormous, McIntosh said. So I think a much better stopgap would be to keep the Republican majority in both of these races.\\n\\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Across the vast majority of the United States cases, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 are at some of their highest levels yet. These numbers are expected to continue to rise in the following increased travel numbers and family gatherings associated with the holiday season.\\n\\nDespite the very positive news of vaccines becoming available, the reality is that they will not be available for all Americans until the second half of 2021. The lack of widespread vaccine availability has many implications, including the significant economic impact the virus is having on the American worker and economy.\\n\\nWhile we cannot fully return to normalcy or get the economy operating at its full potential until there is either a vaccine or herd immunity, which will not occur any time soon, there are ways in which we can mitigate the impact of the virus.\\n\\nDR. MARC SIEGAL: SPEEDING UP COVID VACCINATIONS — WILL BIDEN'S REVERSAL OF TRUMP POLICY HURT OR HELP?\\n\\nOf course, precautions like mask-wearing and social distancing will help. But we also need to re-evaluate how we approach testing, understanding that information is key to controlling the spread of infection, so we should equip Americans with as much information as possible.\\n\\nWhile the barriers to testing are nothing like they were in the early days of the pandemic, there are still more challenges than necessary. We must make widescale, rapid testing available.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nUntil population-wide immunity is achieved, which won't be reached until the vast majority of the population is vaccinated, the best way to stop the spread of the virus is frequent, regular, reliable testing of millions of Americans. This testing should offer clear and rapid results and be self-administered in private settings.\\n\\nWhile the FDA recently approved the first over-the-counter COVID-19 test, the main barriers to widescale rapid testing remain both regulatory and political. Daily testing with easy-to-use, rapid paper-strip tests is the most effective bridge to when we can achieve population-wide immunity.\\n\\nMost of the nearly 300 COVID-19 tests FDA-approved COVID tests, including paper-strip tests, must be processed in a lab. Except for the recently approved Ellume Health's COVID-19 Home Test, the FDA also limits most tests to persons who have a doctor's prescription.\\n\\nHowever, the at-home, paper-strip test is the simplest and least expensive test. It can be just as reliable as other kinds of tests, if used frequently. All this test requires is a saliva sample rather than a nasal swab and gives a simple yes/no result in the matter of an hour.\\n\\nAlthough less accurate than the FDA's preferred polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, these tests are quite accurate for detecting contagiousness, which is what matters most during this pandemic. Additionally, it is arguably more useful than PCR because it's quicker and less likely to detect the virus after the person is no longer contagious. Any false positive – or a suspicious negative for that matter – result can always be caught by double-checking with a PCR test or a second rapid-test that targets a different antigen. This useful, quick test will save more lives than the current, highly accurate but, very slow test.\\n\\nThe faster we make these prescription-free, at-home paper-strip tests available, the faster we can get control of the pandemic.\\n\\nThe faster we make these prescription-free, at-home paper-strip tests available, the faster we can get control of the pandemic.\\n\\nThe FDA needs to immediately drop the prescription requirement – this will significantly increase the likelihood that all people, including those who are asymptomatic but have traveled or visited family, will take a test. The government needs to encourage both the mass production of these tests while also considering subsidizing the cost to ensure all those who need tests are able to obtain them.\\n\\nThis should all be paired with a broader public health initiative to provide people information on how to be tested and the steps to take once the results are known.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThrough easy to obtain, at-home paper-strip tests and a public health initiative to spread awareness, we will increase confidence in our COVID-related activity and aid in garnering trust for our system. This increase of knowledge and information will also enable Americans to actively take personal responsibility actions, in a way not possible currently, empowering them to do so much more to help.\\n\\nOf course, we need a vaccine to get the virus completely under control. However, we could put these measures in place immediately, which would greatly increase information and the ability of all of us to act more responsibly as we continue to battle the pandemic.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DR.

{"original": "In Pennsylvania, two people were charged with drug-related felonies after police found more than $230,000 worth of cocaine and methamphetamine in an apartment.\\n\\nIn another part of the state, police responding to a call about an overdose stumbled upon more than 1,300 bags of heroin, and 45 grams of meth.\\n\\nIn Iowa, police arrested a man who had more than $10,000 and a large quantity of of cocaine and meth in his hotel room. And in Florida, police who stopped a driver for speeding found 36 grams of cocaine, and roughly 22 grams of meth in his car.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThese incidents, which happened across the last four weeks, show a relatively new trend in the rise and availability of meth and cocaine across the U.S.\\n\\nThe development is, in part, an outgrowth of the crackdown on opioids in the U.S., and the result of cartels finding other drugs. The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA), released last fall, noted the rise of more potent forms of meth and cocaine in the United States.\\n\\nAnd the drugs are being smuggled into the country., the report noted, mainly by Mexicans, through the U.S.-Mexico border.\\n\\nWe're seeing an explosion, said Mike Stuart, U.S. attorney for the southern district of West Virginia, according to the Washington Times. We have all hands on deck in fighting the opioids crisis — the height of that might have been two years ago. It's important right now that we're ready and tackling the meth crisis that's going to happen, and that we're hitting the cocaine crisis.\\n\\nThere's always going to be a demand for illegal and illicit drugs.\\n\\nColombia, which for a time had been lauded for getting some control of drug cartels, is again a major player in a source country for narcotics – particularly cocaine – in the U.S.\\n\\nA peace process between the Colombian government and rebels had the unintended result of spawning more land use for the production of coca leaf, as the previous president stopped aerial fumigation meant to destroy coca crops. Farmers then switched to coca in the hope of qualifying for a government offer to compensate those who were growing the crop.\\n\\nParticularly worrisome in recent years has been the mixture in many overdose cases of cocaine and illicit fentanyl, authorities say. The same is happening with meth, said Van Ingram, executive director of the Kentucky Office of Drug Control Policy, to the Washington Times.\\n\\nThe Mexican meth is so cheap you couldn't make it for cheaper than you could buy it, said Ingram. Meth-related fatal overdoses rose in Kentucky by nearly 30 percent in 2017 from 2016. Nationally, they totaled some 10,000 in 2017, the Times said.\\n\\nCocaine overdose deaths rose to about 14,500 in 2017, twice what they were in 2015. Some areas of the country have seen a sharper rise in cocaine- and meth-related deaths. Often, illicit opioids such as fentanyl are mixed in with the drugs. In Connecticut, from a mix of cocaine and fentanyl soared to 220 in 2017 from 42 in 2015.\\n\\nFentanyl is sometimes deliberately mixed with cocaine to create a 'speedball,' or with cocaine and heroin for a 'super speedball,' explained the NDTA report. The desired outcome can be for the user to experience the 'high' of the cocaine with the depressant (heroin and/or fentanyl) helping to ease the otherwise sharp comedown after the effects of the cocaine subside.\\n\\nCOLOMBIA'S PEACE AGREEMENT BLOODIED BY DISTRUST, DRUGS, VENEZUELAN REGIME\\n\\nBut many users are unaware the cocaine or meth they consume is laced with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, even in small amounts.\\n\\nThe DEA says that as little as two milligrams of fentanyl is a fatal dose for most people. Fentanyl can be up to 50 times more potent than heroin.\\n\\nThe drugs are appearing across the country. In Minnesota in September, a drug task force seized over 170 pounds of methamphetamine, with authorities saying it was the largest single meth bust in the state's history. The estimated street value was $7.75 million.\\n\\nMethamphetamine is still big business in Minnesota and Drug Trafficking Organizations bring meth to major metropolitan hubs like Chicago and Minneapolis then break down the product for mid-level dealers, said Faribault Police Chief and Violent Crime Coordinating Council Chair Andy Bohlen was quoted as saying. Eventually, the drug continues to spread and ends up in all communities across the state.\\n\\nIn other states, authorities have sounded the same theme.\\n\\nAlso in September, authorities involved in a drug-related arrest in Banks County, Georgia, said they had made the largest methamphetamine confiscation in the county's history. Deputies seized 52.2 pounds of methamphetamine worth over $2.6 million, 6.9 pounds of cocaine worth $392,000, $22,000 in cash, and 10 firearms.\\n\\nWe are accustomed to large quantities of drugs passing through our jurisdiction by way of the interstate, Sheriff Carlton Speed said in a statement to Fox 5 Atlanta. However, this is a unique case because the Cartel essentially set up shop in Banks County."}
{"original": "Dozens of inmates convicted of terrorism-related crimes will be released from prison over the next five years, and lawmakers in several states think local law enforcement have the right to know if they're moving into their neighborhood.\\n\\nThat's why officials are pushing for a new kind of registry, modeled after sex-offender registries that exist in most states – only for terrorists.\\n\\nAfter the Pulse nightclub and the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting, we know we can be susceptible to terrorist attacks, Florida state Rep. Mike Hill, a Republican, told Fox News regarding his legislation to create such a terrorist registry. A proposal like this may draw a little opposition, but this should be something that unites us.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nHill was referring to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, where a man who identified with the Islamic State killed 49 people in 2016; and the Fort Lauderdale airport shooting in 2017, in which an Alaska man killed five people.\\n\\nLawmakers in Louisiana and Missouri also will be proposing bills in the 2019 legislative session to establish terrorist registries modeled after the sex-offender lists, said Christopher Holton, vice president for outreach at the Center for Security Policy, a national-security think tank.\\n\\nThere is precedent, Holton told Fox News. We are not breaking new ground.\\n\\nIn 2016, the New York state Senate passed a terrorist registry, but the measure died in the state Assembly.\\n\\nUnder most state proposals, failure to register with local law enforcement would be a felony for those convicted of terrorism-related crimes — such as attempting to finance terrorism or seeking to join a terror cell. Registration would be for life — with some possible exceptions to be determined by state courts or law enforcement.\\n\\nIt's just as important—maybe more important with regard to a national impact—as a sex-offender registry, Missouri state Rep. Mike Moon, a Republican, told Fox News.\\n\\nAmericans were joining the fight abroad or attempting to provide aid and comfort to terrorist organizations, Moon continued. They were apprehended, tried and incarcerated. When they are released, at least some will have the mentality to destroy America. Every sheriff should know if they are in the area.\\n\\nWhile the worst terrorists may be imprisoned for life, most terror-related convicts serve an average sentence of 13 years, usually in high-security federal prisons in Florence, Colo.; Terre Haute, Ind.; and Marion, Ill., The Associated Press reported.\\n\\nSince 9/11, the federal government prosecuted about 400 jihadists. At least 61 individuals with terrorism-related convictions will be released from prison between 2018 and 2024, according to a December report, When Terrorists Come Home: The Need for Rehabilitating and Reintegrating America's Convicted Jihadists, sponsored by the Counter Extremism Project, an international policy organization formed to combat extremist ideologies.\\n\\nThe report cited U.S. Sentencing Commission numbers showing the recidivism rate for federal prisoners is 44.7 percent after five years, while the rate for state prisoners is 76.6 percent. In 2010, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence estimated about 20 percent of former Guantanamo Bay detainees returned to the battlefield.\\n\\nThus, the recidivism rate among violent extremist offenders within the U.S. is unlikely to be zero, the Counter Extremism Project report said.\\n\\nAmong the terrorists set to be released in the next two years are the American Taliban John Walker Lindh and Kevin James, who plotted attacks on Jewish religious centers and American military institutions, noted Patrick Dunleavy, a former deputy inspector general for the state of New York, in an opinion piece for Fox News last May advocating for a national terrorist registry.\\n\\nIn Louisiana, state Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, a Republican, sponsored a 2018 resolution that created a task force to study the logistics of a state terrorist registry. The task force is expected to have recommendations by February to craft legislation.\\n\\nWe have seen attacks on faith-based institutions and schools, Hilferty told Fox News. This just gives another tool to law enforcement to know when people are released for terrorism-based offenses.\\n\\nNew Orleans lawyer Stephen Gele has worked with the Center for Security Policy to help draft model legislation for states. Gele noted some states have animal abuse or arsonist registries as well.\\n\\nThis is modeled after the sex-offender registry, the one big exception is that it wouldn't be accessible to the public, only local law enforcement, Gele told Fox News. The goal is that it can be accessed in real time by law enforcement. ... To our knowledge, there is no one physically tracking these people upon release. This would be a mechanism for law enforcement in the jurisdictions they live.\\n\\nGele stressed that such laws would not target Muslims, or any religion or race.\\n\\nThe registries would include radical anti-abortion extremists or radical environmentalists that commit acts of terrorism, Gele said. This is not about targeting any particular group, any particular terrorist group or any particular ideology.\\n\\nA terrorist registry would not have the same volume as the sex-offender registry and thus would not have the same cost to establish, Gele added.\\n\\nThe National Sex Offender Registry allows each state to determine which crimes count as sex offenses. A national terrorist registry might be a better option, said retired Marine Col. Paul B. Deckert, who has advocated for the registry in Louisiana. But, it's tough to move anything through Congress, he said.\\n\\nWe have a sex-offender registry and other registries because the pattern is that certain groups of people who do bad are prone do bad again, Deckert told Fox News. If something does happen, don't we want to be able to say we did everything we could to prevent it by having the tools in place to forecast the problem?\\n\\nFred Lucas is the White House correspondent for the Daily Signal."}

{"original": "The growing socialist wing of the Democratic Party will flex its muscle Thursday with the seating of the new Congress, as more self-described Democratic Socialists join the ranks and dozens of sitting and incoming members – including likely 2020 hopefuls – embrace a massive government expansion that would make FDR look like a penny pincher.\\n\\nThe party agenda is increasingly embracing big-government policies like Medicare-for-all and guaranteed jobs programs -- as well as an aggressive Green New Deal that would include all this and more as part of a fundamental overhaul to America's economy and specifically its energy sector.\\n\\nIt's unclear when and if any of them will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years, and reflects a shift in the party itself. A stunning Gallup poll last summer showed Democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism. The term Democratic Socialist was only broadly popularized with the 2016 presidential run of Bernie Sanders, who identifies as one. The enthusiasm behind his bid underscored how ideas that once marinated on the party's fringe were increasingly becoming mainstream.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nNow, two more Democratic Socialists will join Sanders in Congress on Thursday -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the mantle, while Tlaib is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). And while Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib represent only a sliver of the Democratic Party's new majority in the House, they have attracted outsized media attention and are pushing policies with dozens of supporters.\\n\\nMedicare-for-all in particular is quickly picking up support. A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls. Such proposals would lead to more government involvement in health care, and bring the U.S. a step closer to mostly socialized systems such as the British National Health Service. Their popularity is driven by frustration with the current private insurance system, which remains costly on the individual market despite ObamaCare's goals. And while Medicare-for-all is estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, advocates argue some of this would replace out-of-pocket expenses already being shouldered by millions of Americans.\\n\\nBut even more ambitious than Medicare-for-all is what's known as the Green New Deal. While echoing the language of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, the Green New Deal could be an even more sprawling government and economic overhaul. Championed by groups such as the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats, the plan would aim to combat both climate change and income inequality – and has been picked up by lawmakers such as Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\\n\\nWe are calling for a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy ASAP, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\\n\\nA draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.\\n\\nIf that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation.\\n\\nOn the economic front, it also demands a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.\\n\\nIn at least a partial nod to the presumably mammoth cost that overhauling the nation's economy and energy sector would entail, it says that the financing of the Plan would be accomplished by the federal government, using a combination of the Federal Reserve, a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate, in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the Plan will be returned to the treasury, reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment.\\n\\nIndeed, the question that has long dogged such proposals is how to pay for it all. But the answer has typically avoided specifics, instead arguing that America has found ways to pay for other gargantuan costs in the past. In a follow-up FAQ, one explainer says the plan would be funded by the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments, new public banks can be created (as in WWII) to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools (including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes) can be employed, it says.\\n\\nConservatives warn these ambitious programs, though, would do generational damage to the U.S. economy.\\n\\nTogether, Ocasio-Cortez's proposals would effectively eliminate fossil fuels from most of society, destroy millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of wealth, require 'upgrading' every home and business in America, create a national federal jobs-guarantee program, impose single-payer health care (costing trillions more), establish a new system of publicly owned banks, run up the national debt by countless trillions of dollars, and move the United States closer than ever to socialism, Justin Haskins, a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. If we don't stop it, it will destroy our economy for a whole generation of Americans.\\n\\nSome liberal commentators have warmed to the proposals. The New York Times' Paul Krugman said it wasn't clear what the Green New Deal meant, which is what makes it a good slogan.\\n\\nSuch a sweeping policy would almost certainly be dead on arrival as long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress or the White House. Krugman noted the political realities for the left, arguing that Democrats can't enact such a plan this year but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years.\\n\\nBut regardless of how much progress these proposals might make on the House floor, they're already part of the 2020 conversation. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who has been tipped for a White House bid, said last month that he is excited to support the Green New Deal.\\n\\nThe Chicago Tribune reported that Sen. Kamala Harris', D-Calif., staff have been in touch with the organizers behind the Green New Deal. Axios reported Wednesday that Sen.

{"original": "The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, was fatally flawed and one-sided for what was in the agreement, and fatally flawed and one-sided for what was left out.\\n\\nHowever, over five years after the deal was agreed to by President Barack Obama's administration, it seems history may be doomed to repeat itself as Joe Biden, House Democrats and others are trying to get the United States to reenter the agreement with Iran without first securing any new restrictions, conditions or other updates.\\n\\nFor reasons that include the expiring sunset clauses and other dynamics, this would be a strategic U.S. foreign policy blunder, exponentially more dangerous than the original 2015 decision to agree to the JCPOA in the first place.\\n\\nIRAN PLANS 20 PERCENT URANIUM ENRICHMENT 'AS SOON AS POSSIBLE'\\n\\nAs is, this deal is not a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Instead, it is a blueprint for exactly how Iran can secure massive sums of money and get its hands on a nuclear weapon in short order.\\n\\nThe decision by the Trump administration not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal in 2017 was undoubtedly the right call and in America's best interests. However, even if the United States never withdrew from the deal, the sunset provisions poorly negotiated in the agreement would now be upon us, meaning Iran would be well on its way to obtaining a nuclear weapon all while having violated not only the spirit but the letter of the deal.\\n\\nHouse Democrats claim the JCPOA verifiably constrained Iran's nuclear program. But in violation of the deal, prior to U.S. withdrawal from the agreement, Iran spun more IR-6 centrifuges than permitted under the JCPOA. It assembled more IR-8 rotor assemblies than permitted.\\n\\nIran also attempted to acquire carbon fiber that it had agreed not to obtain and it stockpiled more heavy water than what was allowed under the JCPOA.\\n\\nEven though the United States insisted there would be inspections anytime and anywhere of Iran's military sites, the Iranians made it clear before, during and after this agreement was entered into that such inspections would never be permitted. Additionally, the United States agreed to not have any American weapons inspectors participate in any JCPOA inspections.\\n\\nWorst of all, the verification agreement between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency remains a great mystery to this day and still hasn't been submitted to Congress.\\n\\nEven former Secretary of State John Kerry admitted he hadn't read the verification regime detailed in those secret side deals. President Obama said that the Iran nuclear agreement was not based on trust, but verification, but how can U.S. officials sign off on a verification regime they have never read?\\n\\nOn the presidential campaign trail last year, Biden made the promise of reentering the Iran nuclear deal a pillar of his platform. It's clear he believes — as President Obama did — that he wouldn't even need congressional approval to take such an action.\\n\\nAt a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in 2015, I questioned then-Secretary of State Kerry about why the JCPOA wasn't submitted to Congress as a treaty. His answer wasn't a constitutional analysis or based on any other legal reasoning of any sort. It was a political answer. The reason the JCPOA wasn't submitted to Congress as a treaty, Kerry said, was because the Obama administration knew it wouldn't have the votes to be ratified.\\n\\nHouse Democrats say that returning both Iran and the United States to compliance with the JCPOA must be the starting point for further negotiations. But that's not an option. As the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency pointed out, there are too many breaches of this agreement to simply wish everything could just fall right back into place as is.\\n\\nWhile House Democrats claim that withdrawal from the JCPOA eliminated U.S. leverage in addressing other national security issues with Iran, the reality is that the agreement itself eliminated the leverage by negotiating away all of the sanctions that brought Iran to the table in the first place.\\n\\nThe JCPOA failed to address any of Iran's other dangerous activities. These include Iran's commitment to overthrow foreign governments, finance terrorism, illegally test-fire intercontinental ballistic missiles, seek to wipe Israel off the map, and chant Death to America within the government and on their streets. On top of this, Iran unjustly imprisons American citizens and engages in other nefarious behavior.\\n\\nUnder the Trump administration, America's maximum pressure campaign on Iran crippled the regime, eliminated the ISIS caliphate, killed terrorists Qassem Soleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and took other decisive action without starting any new military conflict anywhere on the globe.\\n\\nIn many ways, the Middle East has been undergoing an advantageous realignment in which Israel and other nations in the region are uniting and strengthening their ties, determined to successfully confront a common adversary in Iran.\\n\\nIran does not respect weakness. It only respects strength. Use of force and military action should always be the last possible option, but we must keep it on the table — not because we want war, but because we want to prevent it.\\n\\nOur other instruments of national power — such as diplomacy, economic pressure and more — become greater tools in this effort when Iran understands that the military option is on the table and real.\\n\\nIn stark contrast to this progress, House Democrats are now urging the United States to reenter the Iran nuclear deal with no new conditions, requirements or other updates to the JCPOA.\\n\\nBy reentering the Iran nuclear deal, the U.S. once again would be abandoning the leverage that would bring Iran back to the negotiating table to deal with its nuclear and non-nuclear activities that must be stopped.\\n\\nIranian leaders don't want to reenter the JCPOA as it is for their love of humanity. They want to reenter the JCPOA as it is because they rolled U.S. negotiators at the table to secure this agreement in 2015, and then made out like bandits with the sanctions relief. The current nuclear deal would allow Iran to continue its other non-nuclear hostile activities, and still have nuclear weapons in short order.\\n\\nThe United States must also heed other key lessons learned from the 2015 negotiations with Iran:\\n\\nFirst, if we set red lines for talks, either stand by them or don't set those red lines at all.\\n\\nSecond, don't unilaterally tie ourselves to deadlines that only our side of the table cares about. When the United States is desperate to hit a milestone by a particular date — but Iran couldn't care less — Iran assumes a position of strength over us.\\n\\nThird, don't try to cut a deal just to cut a deal — as if any deal is better than no deal. We must be fully prepared to walk away from talks if necessary.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\\n\\nWe must not be naive, desperate or weak in how we move forward. Just recently, the Green Zone in Baghdad in Iraq was targeted with 21 rockets by an Iranian-backed rogue militia group, killing one Iraqi citizen.\\n\\nWe are often reminded that the challenges we face are with not only Iran's nuclear activities, but its many non-nuclear nefarious activities as well.\\n\\nHow the United States and others have responded to Iran and its proxies in the past and decisions and actions our government takes in the future will determine the fate of this complex, ongoing situation.

{"original": "As the third day of the ongoing impeachment trial of President Trump wrapped up in the Senate chamber, most of the drama was elsewhere -- with one witness for the Democrats accusing a Republican senator of defamation and slander after she questioned his patriotism and implicated him in a scheme to take down Trump from inside the White House.\\n\\nThe off-field spat began Thursday evening on Twitter, when Tennessee GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn quoted the commanding officer of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as saying that Vindman was a political activist in uniform.\\n\\nVindman, a National Security Council official, testified during House Democrats' impeachment inquiry last year that Trump's Ukraine dealings left him in a state of shock, and Democrats were quoting from Vindman's remarks during the Senate trial on Thursday. Vindman has denied knowing the identity of the whistleblower who flagged Trump's fateful July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president -- a claim that Republicans have questioned, because under cross-examination, Vindman apparently admitted to leaking the contents of Trump's call to the whistleblower.\\n\\nAt the time, California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, presiding over the House impeachment inquiry, shut down GOP attempts to press Vindman as to whom he had leaked information about Trump's call, saying it would potentially reveal the whistleblower's identity.\\n\\nBlackburn tweeted as Schiff spoke on Thursday evening: Adam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot. How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy? ... Alexander Vindman broke the chain of command and leaked the contents of the President's July 25th phone call to his pal, the 'whistleblower.' Over a policy dispute with the President! How is that not vindictive?\\n\\nSCHIFF, IN MAJOR REVERSAL, ADMITS HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT HIS OWN CONTACT WITH THE WHISTLEBLOWER\\n\\nIt makes sense that Alexander Vindman leaked the July 25th phone call to his friend (aka the 'whistleblower'), Blackburn continued. They both have lots in common: —Held the same NSC job —Liberals who worked under Obama —Wanted to take out Trump.\\n\\nThe whistleblower's attorney, Mark Zaid, has openly recruited potential informants from within the intelligence community since 2017, when he declared that a coup has started against Trump and predicted that impeachment would follow. Zaid also attempted to solicit prominent actors to raise awareness to his efforts to oust Trump, which began years before Trump's call with Ukraine's leader that ultimately led to his impeachment. Zaid has further acknowledged that the whistleblower had contact with a prominent 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, but has not commented on specifics.\\n\\nVindman's legal team fired back within hours.\\n\\nThis difficult moment in our country calls for seriousness and seriousness of purpose, David Pressman, a lawyer with Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP representing Alexander Vindman, said in a statement obtained by Fox News. Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman has sacrificed enormously for our country. He believes in our country. And he believes in our country's great institutions, including the United States Senate.\\n\\nINGRAHAM INVESTIGATION: MORE TO UNCOVER CONCERNING BIDENS, BURISMA\\n\\nPressman added: That a member of the Senate – at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility – would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice. While Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.\\n\\nSpeaking to The Ingraham Angle late Thursday, Blackburn doubled down, saying that she has spoken to many members of the military who have a problem with the way Vindman circumvented the chain of command to try to undermine Trump's foreign policy.\\n\\nWe honor the service of every man and woman in uniform, Blackburn told anchor Laura Ingraham. You look at what his commanders said. He has a problem with his judgment. That's been pointed out. He had one commander who said he is a political activist in uniform. He has had problems with going outside of his chain of command, which is what he did here.\\n\\nI talk to a lot of military members on a regular basis, Blackburn went on. They have a real problem with some of the things and the manner in which he conducted himself in this matter. What we want to do is make certain that we get to the heart of the issues here; we want to be certain the president is treated fairly. We want to make certain that we move through this and that we get back to the people's business, things they want to see us do, like putting more judges on the federal bench.\\n\\n'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY PROMISED IN 2017 TWEETS\\n\\nAt one point during his impeachment testimony last year, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with the NSC's Tim Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable. But, under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.\\n\\nMorrison further testified he had heard others express concern that Vindman was a leaker, and could not be trusted with key information. Asked about that allegation, Vindman read from a glowing performance review that described him as an exemplary officer.\\n\\nMeanwhile, it remained unclear whether Vindman -- or any other witnesses -- would appear at the Senate trial, with Trump attorney Jay Sekulow telling reporters he didn't expect Democrats would present a compelling enough case to justify that step, but that it was still too early to discuss the issue.\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ADMONISHES BOTH SIDES, AS FIRST DAY OF IMPEACHMENT TRIAL ERUPTS INTO SHOUTING MATCH AFTER MIDNIGHT\\n\\nOn the whole, senators generally seemed somewhat more alert on Thursday, the third full day of the ongoing Senate impeachment trial and the second full day of the Democrats' opening arguments in the case.\\n\\nIt was a long day, Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a key moderate swing vote, told Fox News as the day wrapped on Thursday. I was one pooped puppy.\\n\\nShe said she might have a glass of wine and take a bath tonight to relax. On Wednesday, Murkowski said she was offended when Democratic impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., tried to argue that senators would be participating in a coverup if they opposed Democrats' document requests -- an aggressive move that apparently backfired in the chamber, and led to a rare intervention from Chief Justice John Roberts.\\n\\nOn his way out of the Senate on Thursday, though, Nadler said he was confident.\\n\\nI think we're making an airtight case for anyone who's willing to listen, Nadler told Fox News. The evidence is overwhelming. The president's counsels have not offered any evidence against it, nor will they, because there is no possibility. And as I said the other day, or yesterday, watch what the president's counselors say. It won't be refutations of the evidence; there won't be any new evidence, there will just be criticisms of the House managers, of our procedures, all irrelevant to the charges against the president.\\n\\nFrom the Senate gallery on Thursday, senators could be seen sitting in their seats for longer periods and intently taking what appeared to be more detailed notes than they were the previous two days. Multiple senators told Fox News they believe that's because senators are more rested today after the session on Tuesday drifted into Wednesday, before adjourning at 1:50 a.m. ET.\\n\\nThe day brought few new arguments, as Democrats focused primarily on the abuse of power impeachment article instead of the obstruction of Congress charge. Democrats' impeachment managers said there was no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden did anything improper in dealings with Ukraine, and that President Trump sought a political investigation of Biden by Ukraine solely to sway the 2020 election in his favor.\\n\\nThere was no basis for the investigation the president was pursuing and pushing. None. He was doing it only for his own political benefit, said Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas.\\n\\nSimilarly, they argued that there was no truth to the theory pushed by Trump and his allies that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Although Democrats -- and some news outlets, including The Associated Press -- have repeatedly claimed that the idea of Ukraine meddling is a conspiracy theory, a Ukrainian court has ruled that officials in the country did illegally meddle in the U.S. election. Additionally, a 2017 investigative report by Politico found extensive efforts by Ukrainians to hurt Trump's presidential campaign.\\n\\nIMPEACHMENT BACKFIRE? KEY MODERATE REPUBLICAN SAYS NADLER'S AGGRESSIVE REMARKS HAVE 'OFFENDED' SENATE\\n\\nTrump put himself first, ahead of U.S. policy and the national interest, Schiff, acting as Democrats' lead prosecutor, told the Senate.\\n\\nAdded New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries: The decision to grant or withhold an Oval Office meeting with [Ukrainian] President Zelensky had serious security concerns for both Ukraine and the United States.\\n\\nYesterday, Trump and even some left-of-center commentators mocked Schiff for suggesting that Trump must be removed by the Senate because the 2020 election is already compromised. Schiff also implied Russia might invade the United States.\\n\\nOn Thursday, during his closing remarks, Schiff changed the argument somewhat. Invoking Vindman's statement that here, right matters, Schiff said that Trump needed to be removed because he was dangerous and trusted his personal attorney over the intelligence community.\\n\\nAdditionally, Schiff said Trump could not be trusted in the event that Russian hackers hypothetically attempted to publicize internal documents related to potential Biden corruption.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, Democrats were laughing along as Schiff joked that Trump had made a religious man out of Vladimir Putin,'' a reference to a comment by Putin last November: Thank God,'' he told an economic forum in Moscow, no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine.\\n\\nI was one pooped puppy. — Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski\\n\\nThe theory that blames Ukraine for interfering in the 2016 elections is no laughing matter, Schiff said, calling it central to the impeachment charges. Trump is accused of seeking the Ukraine investigation — and a probe of Joe Biden and his son Hunter — for his own political benefit while holding back congressionally approved military aid as leverage.\\n\\nSCHIFF WARNS RUSSIANS COULD INVADE THE U.S., SAYS 2020 ELECTION IS COMPROMISED SO SENATORS NEED TO REMOVE TRUMP NOW\\n\\nThe White House and some congressional Republicans have raised questions about Hunter Biden's lucrative job on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, and Joe Biden's successful efforts to force the firing of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor. Biden was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president while Hunter made big money in Ukraine, and Hunter got the job after testing positive for cocaine in the Navy Reserves.\\n\\nDuring the House impeachment proceedings, a career State Department employee testified that he had flagged Hunter Biden's apparent conflict of interest at the time but was told essentially not to bother the vice president's office.\\n\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., vowed that Hunter's actions would soon play a large role in the trial.\\n\\nI know a lot about the Trump family and their dealings in Russia, Graham said. I don't know anything about the Biden connection. You're going to hear more about that.\\n\\nAs senators sat through endless hours of arguments on impeachment, they found a new outlet to focus their attention: fidget spinners.\\n\\nSen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., handed out the toys to his colleagues before Thursday's trial proceedings began. A fidget spinner is a small toy designed to be spun between the fingers, relieving stress or boredom.\\n\\nINSIDE THE CHAMBER, RESTLESS LAWMAKERS STRUGGLE TO PAY ATTENTION AS SENATE TRIAL DRAGS ON\\n\\nBurr was seen playing with a blue spinner while listening to arguments by Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., an impeachment manager.\\n\\nOther senators, including Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., were also seen with spinners on their desks.\\n\\nWhile senators are pledged to silence during the trial proceedings — and deprived of their phones and other electronics — they are speaking out during breaks in the action.\\n\\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, rebutted Republican senators who lamented they heard nothing new from House prosecutors. Republicans voted nine times this week to block the Democrats' proposed amendments for new witnesses and documents.\\n\\nIf they want new stuff, there is plenty of it,'' Schumer said at a news conference before Thursday's session. As the [impeachment] managers made clear, a lot of the documents are sitting there, all compiled, all ready to go, with simply a vote of four Republicans to subpoena them.''\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nDemocrats are expected to wrap up their arguments when the proceedings resume at 1 p.m. ET Friday, with Trump's legal team set to make its case for up to three days beginning Saturday. Sekulow deflected rumors that the defense may wrap up in a single day.\\n\\nWe're going to use a sufficient amount of time to defend our case and point out the inconsistencies of their case. We're not going to run out the clock,'' he said. I am confident that whether it is [completed] Saturday or Monday or Tuesday that the case will be made defending the president. I have no doubt.''\\n\\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Marisa Schultz, Caroline McKee, Mike Emanuel, Thomas Firth, Andrew O'Reilly, Jason Donner, and Adam Shaw contributed to this report, as well as The Associated Press."}
{"original": "Cap-and-trade energy tax legislation appears stalled, at least for now, in the U.S. Senate. But that doesn't mean the cap-and-trade energy tax isn't imminent.\\n\\nSenate Environment Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer hasn't even introduced the bill yet; new Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Blanche Lincoln has declared the House bill dead on arrival; and there are several other cross-cutting controversies that divide Democrats on the bill. The Obama administration is unfazed. They are moving full steam ahead with an even more costly regulatory scheme in the name of global warming�shoehorning the regulation of greenhouse gases into the 1970 Clean Air Act, a bill passed before anyone had ever thought of global warming and that couldn't be less suited to the task.\\n\\nDriving the push for this massive power grab and circumvention of the elected branches is a key White House official who avoided Senate confirmation by being installed not as EPA director, but instead as White House Climate Czar: Carol Browner.\\n\\nLong before the Supreme Court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA, that the EPA has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act, Browner (then EPA director under President Bill Clinton) had her general counsel, Jonathan Cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the EPA possessed such a power. At the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that Congress would never allow. Now it's happening, and Browner is right at the center of it.\\n\\nMary Nichols, the chair of the California Air Resources Board, has confirmed that Browner was the lead White House negotiator in establishing new automobile emissions standards, which for the first time rely on EPA's presumed authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the 1970 Clean Air Act. Nichols told The New York Times that Browner quietly orchestrated private discussions from the White House with auto industry officials. We put nothing in writing, ever,� Nichols said.\\n\\nLeft unchecked, Browner will move beyond automobiles to EPA's entire staggering 18,000-page blueprint for regulating the U.S. economy. It will eventually regulate everything that moves (light-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, buses, motorcycles, planes, trains, ships, boats, tractors, mining equipment, RVs, lawn mowers, fork lifts, and just about every other piece of equipment that has a motor) and lots of things that don't (any building over 100,000 square feet could be pulled in, along with smaller carbon dioxide emitters, like restaurants, schools, and hospitals that have commercial kitchens with gas burners).\\n\\nIt's bad enough that the EPA is moving ahead with plans to pursue expensive global warming regulations instead of leaving the complex issue to Congress, the branch of government constitutionally tasked with making laws. It's made much worse by the fact that the effort is being led not by Lisa Jackson, the duly confirmed and therefore accountable administrator of the EPA, but by Carol Browner, the unaccountable, unconfirmed White House Climate Czar.\\n\\nBrowner was made a czar so that her powers could be more sweeping than they would be in any single official appointment�witness her cross-agency role in the secret automobile emissions regulations�and to avoid the scrutiny of Senate confirmation, which would have been difficult for Browner. Since leaving the Clinton administration she has moved further left, even becoming one of the 14 members of the Socialist International Commission for a Sustainable World Society� on whose Web site she was listed as a member as recently as January 5, the day she was named White House Climate Czar.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Commission pursues a clearly socialist agenda of centralized control under a regime of global governance that would enforce extreme environmental political correctness on a global basis. It's far outside the political mainstream and would have presented serious problems for centrist Democrats facing a confirmation vote.\\n\\nIt's one thing for President Obama to surround himself with the advisers he'd like to have, but it's another to bestow on them sweeping powers to broker secret negotiations and push forward vast new regulations that could cost American families thousands of dollars.\\n\\nFortunately, we'll be able to see this week where members of the U.S. Senate stand on allowing Carol Browner to direct taxpayer dollars and pursue vast new regulatory power grabs. Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana has introduced an amendment (SA 2440) to the Department of the Interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for Browner's policy directives. Any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just Carol Browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.\\n\\nMr. Kerpen is director of policy for Americans for Prosperity.

{"original": "It's official. By executive fiat, President Obama will grant amnesty to up to 5 million immigrants living illegally in the United States.\\n\\nHow did we get here? Didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?\\n\\nIf Obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.\\n\\n[pullquote]\\n\\nConsider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.\\n\\nWell, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.\\n\\nPresident Obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that Congress failed to act. No, Mr. President, Congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.\\n\\nThere is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.\\n\\nBut the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.\\n\\nNow, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.\\n\\nRecently, when asked why he disagreed with himself, the president insisted, Well, actually, my position hasn't changed. After the laughter died down, the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama an upside-down Pinocchio for his tortured denial of a blatant flip-flop.\\n\\nThe president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:\\n\\n1. Distorting Prosecutorial Discretion\\n\\nPresident Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.\\n\\nIn past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.\\n\\nBy contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.\\n\\nIt is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.\\n\\nHowever, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.\\n\\n2. Usurping Legislative Authority\\n\\nOur Constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. Congress is vested with writing laws and the President is charged with executing those laws. This is especially true when it comes to immigration.\\n\\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.\\n\\nYet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.\\n\\n3. Breaching His Sworn Duty\\n\\nPresident Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.\\n\\nIn 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.\\n\\nIf President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?\\n\\nMen like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.\\n\\nAnd they feared future presidents like Mr. Obama.\\n\\nIn the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. They held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. Even Lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the Civil War were grounded in the Constitution and the rule of law.\\n\\nBut, like the title of his autobiography, Mr. Obama's measure of himself seems defined by the word audacity. It is no more evident than now."}

'I've known Mike Pence forever,' Inhofe said Tuesday night. 'I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today.' 'I had a long conversation with him,' said Inhofe. 'He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump).'' Aside from Wednesday's attempted takeover of the Capitol, the past few days have been difficult for Inhofe because he refused to go along with protesting the Electoral College results. 'We've had calls. We've had threats. … I have many very, very close friends mad at me, when all I'm doing is upholding my oath,' Inhofe said.\\n\\n\\n\\nKinzinger backs removal - Fox News: GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger has called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against President Trump following a harrowing day at the nation's Capitol. 'The president is unfit, and the president is unwell,' Kinzinger said in a searing video posted to Twitter on Thursday, a day after thousands of rioters flocked to Washington, D.C., to stymie the vote to certify the Electoral College tally for President-elect Joe Biden. Pro-Trump supporters, encouraged by the president's rhetoric, stormed into the building, forcing lawmakers into hiding for hours. He called on Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet to use the Constitutional amendment to declare Trump unfit for office and 'ensure the next few weeks are safe for the American people.'\\n\\n\\n\\nBarr: Trump committed 'betrayal of his office' - Politico: Former Attorney General William Barr accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of a 'betrayal of his office' — the latest rebuke of the president by a former high-ranking administration official after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. 'Orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable,' Barr said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. 'The President's conduct yesterday was a betrayal of his office and supporters.' Barr's criticism on Thursday was not his first public comment on the chaos at the Capitol. As the president's supporters breached the building on Wednesday afternoon, he released a statement through his spokesperson that did not refer to Trump by name. 'The violence at the Capitol Building is outrageous and despicable,' Barr said on Wednesday. 'Federal agencies should move immediately to disperse it.'\\n\\n\\n\\nTop officials leave over Trump misconduct - Fox News: With just two weeks left before the Trump administration vacates Washington D.C., some staffers are resigning in protest after demonstrations breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by protesters following a speech by President Trump. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, East Wing Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, and Social Secretary Rickie Niceta all submitted their resignations after pro-Trump supporters mobbed the U.S. Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. Late Thursday morning, a senior administration official told Fox News that Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, resigned Wednesday afternoon as a result of the president's actions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mick Mulvaney -- special envoy to Northern Ireland and President Trump's former chief of staff -- on Thursday also resigned, telling CNBC: 'I can't stay here.'\\n\\n\\n\\nTrump repeats claims that drove mob in response to certification - Fox News: President Trump promised an 'orderly transition' on Jan. 20 after Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory. The certification came after a day in Washington, D.C., that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from Trump on Twitter that called for calm in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,' the statement read.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RULEBOOK: RAYS OF GLORY FROM THE GLOOM\\n\\nIf now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated. – Alexander Hamilton, in his essay The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, Federalist No. 9\\n\\n\\n\\nTIME OUT: IT MUST HAVE BEEN MOONGLOW\\n\\nThe Writer's Almanac: On this date in 1610, Galileo wrote a letter describing his discovery of three of Jupiter's moons. He discovered them in December, after improving his telescope design. He wasn't sure at first they were moons; he thought they were fixed stars. He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers. Marius's names stuck, and today we know the moons as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\\n\\n\\n\\nGOT A WILD PITCH?

Garland serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in 2016. But his nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued the American people should have a say in selecting the president who fills the vacancy. In addition to serving on the D.C. Circuit, where he was its chief judge until February 2020, Garland is a veteran of the Justice Department, leading the prosecutions of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Ted Kaczynski, the 'Unabomber.'\\n\\n\\n\\nBiden said to pick Boston mayor as Labor boss - Politico: President-elect Joe Biden has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former top union leader, to serve as his Labor secretary, according to four sources, ending a selection process that split the labor movement and stoked diversity concerns among Democrats. Walsh beat out a host of other names floated for the position, including Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris, California Labor Secretary Julie Su and AFL-CIO Chief Economist Bill Spriggs. His selection suggests that Biden was willing to overlook calls for a diversity choice, since Walsh is a white man, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders had been lobbying heavily for Su. Spriggs is Black.\\n\\n\\n\\nBiden reportedly will name R.I. governor to lead Commerce - WSJ: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo as his commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California economic development official, to lead the Small Business Administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Raimondo was elected as the first female governor of Rhode Island in 2014. Before that, she served as the state's general treasurer. She also led the Democratic Governors Association from 2018 to 2019. Before she entered public service, Ms. Raimondo co-founded Point Judith Capital, a venture-capital firm. Ms. Guzman was a senior official at the SBA during the Obama administration, serving as deputy chief of staff. In 2019, she became the director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she helped implement a grant program for businesses affected by the pandemic.\\n\\n\\n\\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\\n\\nCotton condemns tactics used by Cruz, Hawley - The Hill\\n\\n\\n\\nThe complete list of lawmakers who backed Trump bid to steal election - NYT\\n\\n\\n\\nHoyer announces no sessions of the House until after the inauguration - Fox News\\n\\n\\n\\nPence chief of staff says Trump locked him out of White House - NY Post\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Judge's Ruling: COVID restrictions violate our natural rights to personal liberty - Fox News\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDIBLE: 'GETTING IN TUNE TO THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW'\\n\\nThe rule of law is not just some lawyer's turn of phrase.

In a news conference Thursday night, newly-elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22. Even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, Pelosi called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it. We're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall? Pelosi told reporters.\\n\\nEarlier Thursday, President Trump made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room to congratulate Pelosi on once again becoming House speaker and to stand by his repeated calls to fund a border wall. At the president's request, Pelosi and other congressional leaders are scheduled to return to the White House on Friday morning to resume talks to end the shutdown.\\n\\nA WARNING TO PELOSI AND HOUSE DEMS: Republican strategist Colin Reed says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats should not celebrate too long. They are about to be reminded that governing is a lot more difficult than making campaign promises - and Democrats are far from being united ... In an op-ed on FOXNews.com, Reed writes: House Democrats are about to find out that governing is harder than campaigning. Their majority is paved through 31 districts won by Trump in 2016 that flipped blue in 2018, many of which had resided in the GOP column for generations.\\n\\nThese red districts are not fertile political ground for the deep blue policies pushed by progressives, Reed continues. Furthermore, many of these new members of Congress explicitly pledged to oppose Pelosi in order convinces voters of their electability – pledges that are about to be put to the test. Already, the intra-party Democratic fault lines are evident.\\n\\nANALYST DISILLUSIONED WITH JOURNALISM AND 'TRUMP CIRCUS': Longtime military analyst William Arkin has stepped down from his role at NBC News with a scathing letter criticizing the current state of journalism as well as President Donald Trump ... Arkin, a U.S. Army veteran who has worked for NBC as a reporter and commentator over the course of three decades, wrote a 2,228-word internal memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday, declaring that the world and the current state of journalism have been in tandem crisis. My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment.

Alachua County Fire Rescue reported that flames ignited after 50 gallons of diesel fuel spilled on the highway. Emergency crews extinguished the fire and said they were treating the crash as a homicide investigation, but did not say why.

{"original": "PAMPLONA, Colombia – A little girl plays with her mother's identification card – tossing, catching and guarding it fiercely. It's the only thing she has to call her own.\\n\\nBoys nearby play soccer with an empty soda bottle. Men, reduced to tears, hide away in makeshift tents, counting pennies to feed their families.\\n\\nIt first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, Todd Chapman, the U.S Ambassador to Ecuador, told Fox News. People don't leave their children behind because they want to. It is because of the dire circumstances on the ground in Venezuela are causing people to take this consequential and dangerous and desperate decision to seek a better life elsewhere.\\n\\nThe depth of the catastrophe threatens to unravel the stability and wreak financial havoc beyond just Latin America - with little end in sight. It's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to Moises Rendon, associate director and fellow for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\\n\\nYou have a humanitarian and economic collapse, mass immigration and the government cracking down along with institutional collapse, he said. Combine all these aspects together, and Venezuela is fast becoming a threat for the civility of the whole region.\\n\\nResponse for Venezuelans, the coordination platform for refugees and migrants, documents at least 16 countries that now need assistance in tending to the ever-burgeoning mass migration flow.\\n\\nNeighboring countries have subsequently been forced to deal with spikes in crimes, sex, and drug trafficking, and criminals – both from Venezuela and from home nations – seeking to take advantage of those most desperate amid the calamity.\\n\\nIn most towns and cities across Latin America, bus terminals have become sleeping hubs for new arrivals from Venezuela – but often raising the ire of authorities who have been purporting to dismantle them – given they, too, have become hubs for drug dealing, crime, sexual assault, and other illicit activities.\\n\\nAnd for that reason, they are squalid, dirty and dangerous places for vulnerable Venezuelans. Officials refer to those leaving Venezuela as being a mixed migration flow rather than refugees.\\n\\nAlthough more than 3.3 million Venezuelans are estimated to have left the country since 2015, only a small portion – for example, just 11,000 in Ecuador – have applied for asylum.\\n\\nMany just can't feed their children so their focus is on just getting a job, anything until they can go home again, explained UNHCR's Representative in Ecuador, María Clara Martín. I have rarely seen a Venezuelan who says they don't want to return.\\n\\nOther professionals underscored the lack of information on how to apply for asylum and the needed qualifications, an issue various NGO and UN bodies are endeavoring to address.\\n\\nSantiago Chavez, Ecuador's Vice Minister of Mobility, said there are more than 300,000 Venezuelans currently living in Ecuador, with about three-quarters having entered in an irregular – otherwise illegal – way.\\n\\nThe effort that Ecuador is having to do here is proportional to Germany allowing a million Syrian refugees in, and yet there is a big difference as Germany is a big, industrial country with a lot of resources to tend to the crisis, Chavez said. Ecuador, in contrast, has very limited resources.\\n\\nJobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the Venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. Antonio Ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of Caracas and opposition leader now exiled in Spain, told Fox News more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.\\n\\nWhile fleeing to another nation provides some hope, most resort to street selling.\\n\\nAt the Resting House in Quito, Ecuador a group of 20-something former students and professionals take turns selling cookies in different parts of the street.\\n\\nI've only been able to send money home to Venezuela on two occasions, lamented Yondel Alestre, 24, explaining that few in the shelter where he stays own a smartphone, making it difficult to contact family members. My wife is in Colombia, where she had to go to give birth as there was no medical care in Venezuela. My other children are with my mother in Venezuela and I have to stay in Ecuador to try to work.\\n\\nThe impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to Chile or Colombia, while others ventured to Peru or Argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.\\n\\nIt's really rough what the migrants have gone through. Everyone is frustrated, depressed, said Marcelo Viteli, the General Manager of the Resting House where up to 80 migrants are permitted to seek shelter for a few months after arrival.\\n\\nINSIDE LATIN AMERICAN 'AMAZING RACE' STAR'S DRAMATIC ESCAPE FROM VENEZUELA\\n\\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION WALKING BACK OBAMA-ERA FOREIGN POLICY MISTAKES IN BURMA\\n\\nIt wasn't so long ago that Colombians were fleeing en masse to Venezuela – then the richest nation in Latin America, which still holds the largest known oil reserves in the world – as a simmering 50-year civil war raged on. While the tables have abruptly turned, most Colombians are eager to return the generosity.\\n\\nAn array of Colombian locals have set up their own makeshift shelters, or opened the doors to their own homes to assist the walkers on their long and arduous trek from the bordering nation.\\n\\nAt one small hut near the border town of Cucuta, some 300 mostly women and children pass through to recharge their phones, get some sleep and soup, and pick up an item of clothing from the Samaritan's Purse donation mound.\\n\\nFurther along the winding road, Colombian local Marta Duque – who opened the home to help Venezuelans after feeling a deep sense of sadness for what they were enduring – say she, too, has been threatened with fines and being arrested, given the hazard of having scores of migrants pouring out into the streets.\\n\\nBut she refuses to give up and shut down. I have to help because I understand what they are going through, why they have to leave, Duque said.\\n\\nOne young mother, Marisela, cradles her young son on Duque's floor, and encourages him to take deep breaths.\\n\\nHe is asthmatic, and there was no help for him, no medication in Venezuela, and the attacks became worse, she said. Life there is chaotic in every sense. I hope to get him medicine in Colombia. But without government change, there is no going home.\\n\\nThe acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to Venezuelans, but to the region at large. The country is enduring a dire shortage of vaccinations and treatments for illnesses and diseases, prompting a concern that once eradicated conditions such as measles and diptheria are not only spreading in the financially depleted nation, but now threatens millions across Latin America.\\n\\nThe migration in 2018 has been fast and fleeting. Ecuador, for one, went from seeing the entry of thirty to forty Venezuelans per month to a peak of around 90,000 in May this year. A second wave hit in October, and at least 70,000 a month have been entering since.\\n\\nPeople who crossed before had at least a few dollars in their pocket for basic needs. Now they have absolutely nothing, said Victor Bautista, director for development and border integration at the foreign ministry in Colombia. In just six months, we went from 170 thousand migrants here to one million. Sixteen months ago, we had just 32,000. Something must be done. The humanitarian issues are unbelievable, and they will hurt the entire region.\\n\\nBoth government and non-governmental professionals tending to the regional calamity concurred that this year there has been a profile shift in those fleeing.\\n\\nIn the first few years of the meltdown, which gained momentum in 2015, those with some finances and education were able to buy plane tickets out. But as the situation has slowly deteriorated, those from poorer backgrounds started to escape.\\n\\nOne U.S government official closely monitoring the case told Fox News that while official displacement camps have not yet been established, calling this a last resort it is an option on the table being considered.\\n\\nExperts surmise that at least one in 10 leaving Venezuela now are disabled, and have pointed to an uptick in unaccompanied minors crossing international borders – mostly boys between the ages of 15 and 17. But many don't have documentation.\\n\\nUltimately, the buck stops with local governments who are then in-charge of tending to the minors, with local aid agencies doing their best to offer guidance and support to the already overwhelmed government bodies.\\n\\nBut with mass migration, comes surges in what some deem xenophobia toward Venezuelans, what others claim to be integration problems, and what others characterize as one citizen's need to put their own families first, over that of legal and illegal arrivals.\\n\\nWe are trying to establish programs that can be of benefit to both Ecuadorians and Venezuelans, and address the welfare concerns of both, said the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Ecuador's Chief of Mission, Manuel Hoff.\\n\\nIn several soup kitchens and shelters, separate lines and dining areas have had to be set up separate the poor locals from the Venezuelans, as to avoid any contention.\\n\\nYet the end game is unclear. All signs point to the situation only worsening, especially after January 10, when Maduro begins another presidential term. Though his term is not recognized by most of the international community, which viewed the 2017 presidential election as a farce.\\n\\nSo Maduro will after Jan. 9 be deemed illegitimate in the eyes of most international players – including the United States – which has been mulling designating Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism alongside Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan.\\n\\nYet Venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of Cuba, Iran, China, Russia and Turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against Venezuela, and this year Turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela. And Russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent Maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.\\n\\nThe Maduro regime has – for the most part – denied the existence of a major crisis in its country, instead blaming the US- and US-supported political foe for waging economic war.\\n\\nOver the past fiscal year, the United States has already given almost $100 million – distributed through the Department of State and other agencies – to assist in the humanitarian response to the regional Venezuela contingency. In September, the U.S. pledged a further $48 million. Moreover, the Department of Defense spending in the region over the past year totaled more than $110 million.\\n\\nThe number of Venezuelans fleeing is expected to reach 5.3 million by the end of 2019, according to the United Nations, in what has become the largest exodus in modern Latin American history.\\n\\nThe U.N High Commissioner for Refugees stated that humanitarian organizations will require $738 million to provide vital services such as food and shelters to help ease the burden on receiving nations.\\n\\nIt is forecasted that Colombia will continue to receive the most migrants, at least another 1.2 million over the coming year totaling 2.2 million, while its expected Peru will have 1.4 million Venezuelans by the end of 2019. Ecuador, Brazil, as well as other countries in the Southern Cone, Central America and the Caribbean too are predicted to see a swell in Venezuelan arrivals.\\n\\nThe UN is projecting that at least two million more Venezuelans will flee their crumbling country over the course of the year.\\n\\nNonetheless, Chapman, the American Ambassador in Ecuador, underscored the U.S is committed to the cause, and said the Trump administration has long been resolute in supporting the humanitarian response in the region.\\n\\nWhat has been shocking to me is I am seeing parallels to other places I have worked – Afghanistan and Mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. People have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. It is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the Venezuela crisis all the more important."}
{"original": "Overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, House Democrats on Thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees.\\n\\nAlthough planned portions of the rules relating to the House's handling of ObamaCare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's opposition to the measure.\\n\\nThree Republicans supported the Democrats' rules, including Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, and New York Reps. John Katko and Tom Reed. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and California Rep. Ro Khanna voted against the rules package.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.\\n\\nThe pay-go principle, Ocasio-Cortez charged in a tweet Wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\\n\\nWe shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added. But, Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill fired back, tweeting: A vote AGAINST the Democratic Rules package is a vote to let [Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)] Mick Mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing Democratic initiatives and funding increases.\\n\\nPay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. Last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nOther rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.\\n\\nThe rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.\\n\\nAnd, although hats have been barred in the House chamber for more than a century, a new House rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear. That means the rules will still preclude Democratic Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson from wearing her signature cowboy hats on the House floor -- but Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.\\n\\nAdditional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held.\\n\\nPortions of the rules had also provided that the House has the authority to defend ObamaCare, which was recently ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, in court.\\n\\nDEM INTRODUCING IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES AGAINST TRUMP ON FIRST DAY OF NEW CONGRESS\\n\\nMeanwhile, House Democrats Thursday night debated a combined spending bill to end part of the government shutdown.\\n\\nThe House late Thursday ultimately passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.8, by a 239 to 192 vote. But the bill does not include any new wall money, and Senate Republicans and the White House have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five Republicans voted for the bill.\\n\\nAnother piece of legislation proposed and debated by Democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. That bill, which the White House has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.\\n\\nIn a news conference Thursday night, Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22 amid demands from the White House that any federal spending bill include funding for a wall on the southern border.\\n\\nHowever, Pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it.\\n\\nWe sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. The president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. And we will do that. And we will have a discussion. Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.\\n\\nTrump met with Pelosi and other senior Democrats at a contentious meeting on Wednesday in the White House Situation Room, which included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen within five seconds, according to Republicans at the meeting. The sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new Congress was seated Thursday.\\n\\nThe message is very simple: This is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said afterward.\\n\\nWATCH: TRUMP HOLDS SURPRISE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH BORDER PATROL UNION\\n\\nShortly after Pelosi's historic return to the House speakership, Trump made his first-ever appearance in the White House briefing room to congratulate Pelosi and reaffirm his commitment to the border wall.\\n\\nTogether with officials from the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, Trump insisted that we need protection in our country.\\n\\nI promise you, if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol union, told the media after Trump's introductory remarks. I worked in Naco, Ariz., for ten years. We didn't have physical barriers in Naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.\\n\\nTrump himself likely will soon deliver that message in person to congressional Democrats. In a show of normalcy towards the end of a whirlwind day of history and drama on Capitol Hill, Pelosi on Thursday evening formally invited Trump to deliver State of the Union speech in Congress on Jan. 29.\\n\\nFox News' Chad Pergram and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report."}

But past meetings have resulted in both sides digging in, with Trump insisting on nearly $6 billion for a border wall and Democrats saying they won't entertain the discussion until Congress passes and Trump signs a package re-opening shuttered federal agencies.\\n\\nTuesday night's primetime address saw both camps drifting even further apart, with Trump declaring a humanitarian and security crisis and vowing to protect America, so help me God – and Democratic congressional leaders saying Trump is working to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration.\\n\\nDEMS ACCUSE TRUMP OF 'MALICE' AFTER BORDER SPEECH\\n\\nSpeaking Wednesday on Fox News' America's Newsroom, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez echoed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's language.\\n\\nThis whole border security crisis … it really, I believe, is a manufactured crisis, he said, adding that it's distracting from issues like health care and education.\\n\\nThe fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat; they are a humanitarian challenge, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the joint Democratic rebuttal alongside Schumer.\\n\\nTrump and his allies say Democrats, many of whom supported border security measures in the past, are only bucking the calls now because of knee-jerk opposition to his administration.\\n\\nBut Perez maintained that Democrats believe in meaningful border security, and also believe a wall is not smart policy.\\n\\nTRUMP DECLARES CRISIS AT BORDER\\n\\nHow the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear.

The court order has limited immediate impact because the government has largely suspended asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border during the coronavirus pandemic, citing public health concerns.\\n\\nStill, letting the rules take effect would have been felt by some who can still claim asylum and make it significantly more difficult for all asylum-seekers once pandemic-related measures are lifted.\\n\\nPresident Trump's administration argued that the measures were an appropriate response to a system rife with abuse and overwhelmed with unworthy claims.\\n\\nTRUMP EXTENDS RESTRICTIONS ON WORK VISAS, SAYS PANDEMIC STILL DISRUPTS 'AMERICAN LIVELIHOODS'\\n\\nThey sought to redefine how people qualify for asylum and similar forms of humanitarian protection if they face persecution at home. The restrictions would have broadened the grounds for a judge to deem asylum applications frivolous and prohibit applicants from ever winning protections in the U.S.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco sided with advocacy groups who sued, saying acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf lacked authority to impose the sweeping rules.\\n\\nDonato, who was appointed to the bench in 2013 by President Barack Obama, wrote that Wolf's appointment violated an established order of succession. He said it was the fifth time a court has ruled against Homeland Security on the same grounds.\\n\\nThe government has recycled exactly the same legal and factual claims made in the prior cases, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts, Donato wrote. This is a troubling litigation strategy. In effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through.\\n\\nMEXICO SEEKS HELP TO GET COVID-19 VACCINES FOR MIGRANTS IN US\\n\\nDonato said his ruling applies nationwide because limiting its reach would result in a fragmented and disjointed patchwork of immigration policy.\\n\\nIt was not immediately clear if the Trump administration would make an emergency appeal. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.\\n\\nAaron Frankel, an attorney for plaintiffs, has called the rules nothing less than an attempt to end the asylum system.\\n\\nAsylum is a legal protection designed for people fleeing persecution based on their race, religion, nationality, political beliefs or membership to a social group. Any foreigner who steps on U.S. soil has a legal right to apply for asylum, according to U.S. asylum law and international treaty obligations.\\n\\nThe rules would narrow the types of persecution and severity of threats for which asylum is granted.

The rest are processed under immigration laws, which include the right to seek asylum.\\n\\nDonato took issue with how people came to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Wolf became acting secretary in November 2019, replacing Kevin McAleenan, who was also in an acting role. Courts have ruled that Wolf improperly leapfrogged to the top job from his position as undersecretary for strategy, policy and plans.\\n\\nDonato, like other judges, said McAleenan, who had been Customs and Border Protection commissioner, also was promoted to the top Homeland Security job out of order, making his handover to Wolf have no legal effect whatsoever.\\n\\nHomeland Security has been without a Senate-confirmed secretary since Kirstjen Nielsen resigned in April 2019.\\n\\nWhile the Trump administration faced a legal setback, it's already instituted a raft of policies restricting asylum, including making asylum-seekers wait in Mexico while their claims are heard in U.S. court.\\n\\nBiden is expected to reverse some of Trump's restrictive asylum measures, including the Remain in Mexico policy, but recently said his administration would need probably the next six months to re-create a system that can process asylum-seekers to prevent a flood of migrants arriving at the southern border.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nAlso Friday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled against the administration's policy that gave state and local governments the right to refuse to resettle refugees.\\n\\nThe three-judge panel said Trump's executive order that required both state and local entities to give their consent before allowing refugees to be placed in their areas would undermine the 1980 Refugee Act. That law set by Congress was designed to allow resettlement agencies to find the best place for a person to thrive while working with local and state officials."}
