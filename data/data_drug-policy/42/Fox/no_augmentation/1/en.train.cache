Democratic Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal and other progressive lawmakers on Wednesday called for transformative change across America as America awaited the results of one Georgia runoff Senate race.
TRUMP: Well, I don't think so, but we will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad. You saw that happening. You saw with all of the men, very few women circling it and circling it very strongly and very viciously, knocking out windows and trying to get in and they were close to getting in and I called out the military. They said, we'll have it there tomorrow. I said, no, you'll have it there today. We're not going to have another Benghazi on our hands. And we did a really amazing job, get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything and that's OK. In the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things. But I think you would have had another Benghazi had we not acted quickly. That could have been stopped. And this was stopped. And we had our Apaches going there, the great helicopters and they were dropping flares all over the place and a lot of things were happening. They had action real fast and everybody disappeared.

With a population of over 33 million, a force of 660,000 troops would be needed in Afghanistan. For a sense of scale, the total U.S. Army active duty force is less than 500,000 soldiers. It's also worth noting that peak U.S. troop deployment during the Vietnam War was more than 500,000 soldiers and we did not win that counterinsurgent operation.

Twitter's longstanding policy is to ban accounts that promote violent extremism, share personal information of others in order to harass them (also known as doxing), or engage in abusive behavior or operating fake accounts, among other violations.

We embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told the National Automobile Dealers Association Tuesday, adding that higher fuel economy standards would hurt consumers by increasing the average sticker price of new cars and requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles.
Sen. Dayna Polehanki pushed an effort to ban all firearms from the Capitol by introducing legislation last year that died in session. The Livonia Democrat said Monday before the panel vote that an open carry ban does not go far enough and will lead to a false sense of security for those who work at and visit the Capitol.

Now this is a national poll so people focus on state by state so I understand but still an interesting snapshot. Sanders is at 19. Warren's at 16. Buttigieg, who we've relentlessly seen pushed by the media and Hollywood, way down below everybody at 7.2 percent. So is this Joe Biden's to lose in my view. Politico, I think it was Politico had a headline today, you know, they - all their efforts have to not. Biden's still at the top of the heap.

Here's one nugget of sage advice senior lawmakers will tell the Congressional neophytes: Get to know and be nice to the Capitol cops. The U.S. Capitol Police force guards the Capitol 24/7, 365 days a year. It's officers are tasked with a thankless, impossible job. With such a big class of lawmakers coming in, it will take officers a while to learn what all of the newcomers look like. Former Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-GA) famously berated a U.S. Capitol Police officer who didn't recognize her. McKinney poked the officer in the chest with a closed fist.

President Trump is also requesting $675 million for new technology to detect and stop the flow of illegal drugs over the border. Democrats have long said they wanted that. But Democrats don't want to have an honest conversation about border security. They are now the party of obstruction, and everything must bend to their resist Trump goals. The Hill reports that their latest strategy is to jam up the Senate by refusing to consider any legislation until the government is reopened.

It's not going to grow your 401(k), your bank account, or whatever, as Jill Biden would say. Empowering governments means taking away power from you. More power for the government means less freedom for you. By the way, it's the same government that thinks wasting millions on dead- end investigations and impeachment is more important than infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices.

It comes less than 24 hours after a President Trump appointee, U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy Kernodle, ruled that Gohmert and the Republican electors lacked standing because they allege an injury that is not fairly traceable to the Defendant, the Vice President of the United States, and is unlikely to be redressed by the requested relief.

While Schultz's efforts so far have looked more like an identity crisis than a real candidacy, Steyer is a serious player. He spent much of the past two years generating a list of potential supporters through an impeachment petition he lavishly advertised on television.

Dana Loesch: Right, right. No, I agree. And by the way, I said Harris earlier, and I have no idea where that came from, Tucker. I mean, Jack Wilson. But this whole situation with legacy media and many other individuals looking down their noses at good people who want to be able to protect themselves. I mean, for crying out loud, let's look at Maryland, for example. Maryland, back in just a couple of years ago, when they passed their National Firearms Act, I think this is 2013, 2014. It was all with the promise that, look, law enforcement is going to take care of you. The state is going to protect you. You don't need your firearms to protect yourselves. And then look what happened. Baltimore's homicide rate, their violent crime rate spiked by 300 percent. It's insane. People want to be able to defend themselves because they know that the state, even though the state promises them that they're going to do this, they never make good on it. In fact, some of the biggest errors that we have seen with previous mass casualty incidents had been because people in government have dropped the ball.

The public outrage at Guillén's murder forced an independent review of the base, led by a five-member civilian team.

Now, let's review some of the actions of the FBI director. Many of these actions were clear at the time; others we know only now. What we have learned since underscores that the president's firing of Comey was more than justified, and the actions of Comey's staff and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to trigger the most extensive investigation in history of a campaign, an administration and a president appear to be wholly without justification – and were based instead on politically inspired emotion and hysteria.

U.S policy and intelligence analysts were mostly not surprised by the abrupt rebuff by Taliban brass as part of their negotiation strategy.
Almost immediately after President Trump directed the Pentagon withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria, he ordered a reduction of U.S. forces in Afghanistan—more than 7,000 soldiers, which is about half of the current force. Given the hysterical reaction of Washington's foreign policy establishment about the president's Syria decision, there will certainly be an even more shrill the sky is falling chorus regarding Afghanistan. But whatever one thinks of the president's temperament, his management style, and the decision-making process (or lack thereof), his decision about Syria was the right thing to do, and so is his decision to pull back in Afghanistan. After more than 17 years, it's well past time to wind down America's longest war.

The GOP's 53-member majority can weather several defections in the Senate, and Trump has threatened to use his veto power to defeat any legislation to reopen the government without wall funding. But the indications on Wednesday that some Republicans are increasingly wary of the shutdown, which Trump has said could last for years, highlighted the potential political pitfalls of leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or without pay.

Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to socialism isn't limited to energy and environment-related issues, either. She has also called for the passage of Medicare for All, legislation proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industry—at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.

The CNN narrative for four years was that Trump was a disaster and a threat to democracy. Giving the Biden administration soft coverage helps bolster the previous Trump narrative and serves also to justify the Trump resistance CNN helped manage.

The Democrats don't have that right now. I think, you know, anything is possible. The economy could turn sour sometime during this year, but at this point in the 1992 campaign the economy had already been in recession for a while, and people were very discontented. That's not the case right now. So, President Trump looks very strong to me.

Chris Wallace: Congresswoman Edwards, when you look at not just the money but also the polls, I mean, the thing that I have to say surprised me, Bernie Sanders had a heart attack in the fourth quarter, and there was a lot of talk about that the party wasn't going to go as far left, that they were pulling the voters; they were pulling back to the center.

The Weekly Standard – the conservative magazine founded by Kristol and Fred Barnes – recently went out of business in large part because Kristol refused to drop the magazine's anti-Trump corporate line.

'Orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable,' Barr said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. 'The President's conduct yesterday was a betrayal of his office and supporters.'

The USDA is one of nine federal departments shuttered.
TRUMP: No, no, that's different. I would never do that. But we do need workers in our country. And I do want immigration policy. Nobody's been better on immigration then me. By the way we won the funding for the wall, and the wall has been built anyway because I was taking it out of the military and everything else. And now it's easier. We need people come. I got Foxconn to go into Wisconsin. They have to get people. They spent a fortune, they built the most incredible plant I've ever seen in Wisconsin, Foxconn --
The reason that they give behind this is what's most troubling to me. So they argue that by treating HIV as a negative by criminalizing HIV, that you're stigmatizing people who are living with HIV. That's a ludicrous argument.

Vermont's former governor, Peter Shumlin telling Politico, Bernie and his team feel they're holier than the rest. In the end they'll play dirty. Even if he considers you a friend like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie will come first. Joining me now, Eric Trump, executive VP of the Trump organization. Eric, great to see you tonight.

But my Democratic colleagues felt when they were in charge, we should confirm judges by majority vote. They changed the rules to accommodate President Obama. They tried to stack the court. They never thought Clinton would lose.
However, when it comes to legalizing recreational marijuana, Democrats sing a much different tune. Many of the same folks who have been pushing for healthier school lunches, soda bans, lower salt content in food and calorie disclosures at restaurants suddenly don't care about legalizing a substance that has been scientifically proven to worsen our national public health crisis.
WALLACE: If I may just press, why is a wall immoral?
Your border security presentation submitted to Congress today is yet another example of the misinformation and outright lies the Trump Administration has used to make the case for the President's boondoggle border wall, defend the government shutdown, and distract the American people from a border policy so flawed that children have died in Department of Homeland Security custody, Thompson wrote.

Since at least 2015, both Iranian military operatives and Hezbollah have attempted to set up forward military outposts to threaten and attack Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan, he cautioned. Additionally, the murderous Assad regime is obviously not a responsible world player, and it remains a security interest of Israel to keep the Golan Heights which provides a critical vantage point over northern Israel.

Top Republicans, including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, had sharply criticized Trump's initial plan for a faster pullout from Syria, saying it would endanger U.S.-allied Kurds in the area, help Russia, and destabilize U.S. interests. In response, the White House has argued that America must protect its troops, and noted that it retains the capacity to strike in Syria from bases in Iraq.
Facebook initially flagged Trump's post with a label saying: Joe Biden has been elected President with results that were certified by all 50 states. The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election. The company later removed the post altogether.

Kevin Corke: Over the weekend, Iraq's prime minister strongly criticized the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and prominently took part in the massive anti-U.S. protest in Baghdad. White House officials said it was Soleimani who directed the recent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and was responsible for killing hundreds of Americans worldwide. In Iran, a massive funeral procession through several cities to honor the slain general who many considered the second-most powerful man in the Islamic Republic. Overnight, President Trump tweeting, If Iran attacks an American base or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way. And threatening to strike 52 Iranian sites representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago.

Mr. Romney, you're no Bill Kristol.
I usually strongly disagree with Never-Trump leader Bill Kristol's constant criticism of President Trump. Kristol refuses to recognize the president's major accomplishments in improving the U.S. economy and making our country safer. He can't bring himself to admit that whatever flaws he thinks Mr. Trump may have, our country dodged a bullet with Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton since a Clinton presidency would have continued the disastrous domestic and foreign policies of President Obama. A President Hillary Clinton also would have undermined our freedom by naming at least two far-left Supreme Court justices.

Private citizens have opinions. Individual lawmakers have opinions. But in America, the states conduct elections, the results of which are confirmed by designated officials. Congress has no role in conducting elections, only in verifying that the results are official.
INGRAHAM: Governor Huckabee, when you think about how Trump has been an advocate for a more restrained approach to deployment of our military, and you I have talked about this, he's never gotten any credit for that from the left, not at all. But now they are mad that he is actually doing something to protect American interests against this craven mass murderer.
Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions.
As one of his first orders of business, Newsom -- who also on Monday requested that the Trump administration cooperate in the state's efforts to convert to a single-payer system, even as he bashed the White House as corrupt and immoral -- declared his intent to reinstate the ObamaCare individual mandate at the state level.
This is only par for Cruz, whom many Americans first got to know as the architect of the bogus 2013 defund ObamaCare government shutdown. Then he succored Trump's 2016 candidacy when he thought it would benefit him but concluded his doomed run lashed up with John Kasich and Carly Fiorina in a desperate, goofball bid to block Trump. The guy who told delegates in Cleveland that year to vote your conscience may have abrogated his former views, but never his ambition.

Guy Benson: Happy New Year to you. Let's start with impeachment. I want to get to Iran as well. But there was a significant development today. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who we know, of course, around here at Fox, pretty well put out a statement saying that after weighing all of the issues, he has, quote, concluded that if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify. He is one of those witnesses that we've heard Democrats talking about. The House didn't bother to subpoena him. But I think there could be some merit to hearing what he has to say. What are your thoughts on that development involving John Bolton? Should he testify?
Mike Pompeo: What I'm saying is exactly what President Trump has said. We will take responses that are appropriate and commensurate with actions that threaten American lives. That's what we've done so far, Chris. There's no reason that the American people or the Iranian regime should ever expect we'll do anything different.

But, until then, Democrats have a policy agenda to push. They've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. And they have an election to win. If they want to beat Donald Trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. They've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. That should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.

CRUZ: Well, Maria, you're right. And the Democrats desperately want to keep that topic off the news. And, sadly, an awful lot of folks in the media are very compliant with that. But that's why I said this week the president having the opportunity to defend himself is so important, because I think one of the fundamental defenses that I expect to hear from the White House this week is that the president has inherent authority and, in fact, a responsibility to investigate corruption. And when you look at what happened with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, there is, at a minimum, prima facie evidence of corruption. You have got Hunter Biden getting paid $83,000 a month by Burisma, the largest natural gas company in Ukraine; $83,000 a month is a million dollars a year.

When Kim Jong Un inherited the country's leadership upon his father's death in late 2011, some foreign experts initially questioned his grip on power.

So therefore, it was bipartisan, I guess you could say. We got nothing. They had nothing. We didn't lose one Republican vote. As you know, that's very unusual.

Ari Fleischer, Tom Fitton and Matt Whitaker are going to break down the new members of his legal team, the strategy that they're going to be employing. Why Democrats may come to regret demanding witnesses? We got a lot to unpack. Also tonight, top 2020 Democrats, they're struggling. Hillary Clinton's new documentary, and another Biden looks to cash in on sleeping Uncle Joe. Well, Eric Trump is here to react to that and how long can Democrats deny the advancement for Black America under Trump and just how much of the vote of African-Americans could Trump capture? Herman Cain and Leo Terrell, oh my goodness, I cannot wait for this. They're going to debate this new Wall Street journal piece, it's making a lot of waves and it's Friday so you know Raymond Roy is here. We got the Oscars. Apparently they're too white and to male. And also plus hypocrisy of course out completely out of control plus Prince Harry's embarrassing groveling to the Disney boss, all caught on tape, we'll get all of that but first. As the Senate jockeys over the rules for next week's impeachment trial, the President today announced his defense team and it's stacked with some serious legal minds.

The name is Lev Parnas. Lev Parnas could well be the next surprise twist, the surprise witness for the Democrats. I think this is going to be Schiff's next guy. This is the next bombshell, meaning the whistle-blower is no longer necessary. His information has been trumped, so to speak by Lev Parnas.

Look, the strongest candidate against Trump is going to be somebody who has to assure the country that they can keep the country safe, that they can protect a strong economy even while protecting the welfare state, a kind of pragmatic centrist, like you say. But they have driven those people out of the field, and they did it right at the beginning.

THE 2020 OIL RISK NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT Consider: In the aftermath of the U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the price of oil has only increased by a few percent. Contrast this to past conflicts such as the Iraq wars and the Arab oil embargo of 1973, when the oil price skyrocketed. Turmoil in the Middle East no longer threatens the U.S. energy supply. The U.S. now produces and consumes about 20 million barrels of petroleum products a day. Crude oil production has more than doubled over the last decade as the American fracking revolution and good government policy have combined to create countless gushers. The U.S. is now the world's biggest oil producer. Net petroleum imports have fallen from 10 million barrels a day in 2010 -- about 50 percent of consumption -- to zero.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said: The violent mob in the Capitol today is a disgrace. We prohibit incitement and calls for violence on our platform. We are actively reviewing and removing any content that breaks these rules.

Twitter also slapped the same label--Multiple sources may not have called the race when this was Tweeted--on Abrams' tweet.
Chris Wallace: We should point out that while they were raising that amount of money, Donald Trump in the fourth quarter raised $46 million, far more than any of the others. He's built up a huge campaign war chest, has more than $100 million cash on hand, which raises the question, Michael, how big an advantage for the president, how big a disadvantage for the Democrats, that he's building up this war chest, just sitting there, basically? He's got a couple of people running against him, but nobody serious, while the Democrats, with the money they've raised, which is impressive, are going to spend all of it going after each other.

I think for the senators, and I'm just not talking about the four that have been so much the focus of attention, for every senator, Democrat and Republican, I don't know how you can explain that you wanted a search for the truth in this trial and say you don't want to hear from a witness who had a direct conversation about the central allegation in the articles of impeachment, Schiff said on CNN's New Day.

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning. President Trump's Senate impeachment trial begins this Tuesday. What should we expect? Bringing in right now Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan.

COONS: I think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.

And then starting 2020, starting an election year, she's coming out of the gate with a miscalculation with regard to these articles of impeachment and winning extra-long in order to send them over. A lot of miscalculations done by. I think it's going to be paid at the polls in November. And what she should be doing if she was smart, because she has all these Democrats in districts that Donald Trump won. She should be talking about delivering them wins to go back to their district, but instead all those Trump voters have to be fuming at these Democrats who represent, because they didn't send them to Washington to impeach the President--

Jason Miller, a senior advisor to Trump's 2020 campaign, called the move disgusting.
INGRAHAM: Well, I think they've divided up witness by witness and argument by argument from the constitutional to the fact based arguments so I think that's already in process. Tom Fitton, what we've heard from the media are Cipollone is not a - he's not a media person. He's not done a lot of you know, sexy trial work so they're trying to like I guess, raise expectations, lower expectations for him. But I love the fact and you know, full disclosure, he's a close friend of mine so I know he's going to be fantastic but I love the fact that he's kind of an enigma to them because he's not someone who seeks the limelight. Well, any basic research into his background, he's an experienced attorney. My guess is he can handle politicians in the Senate and that process. You can see though why Nancy Pelosi didn't want the Senate trial to happen and that's why she obstructed it because now you're going to have all these politicians that they have pointed as impeachment managers come over and have to deal with real lawyers. I fear we're going to have a Kavanaugh type situation because in the ordinary course, the President's going to be vindicated in short order so they're going to think of ways to subvert that. This is why your motion for dismissal is a good idea. This is why they should knock Schiff out because he's conflicted.
TRUMP: Honestly, he's going to spend money one way or the other. I mean, he doesn't have the personality for this. He doesn't -- he can't relate to people. He probably inherently dislikes people. So he just doesn't have the retail side of it, which is a big part of it. You can't -- he doesn't have a stage presence. He doesn't have that personality. So he will spend a lot of money, but what's he going to spend it against? And that's the reality.

The effect of this is that there is no longer a free and open social media company or site for any American to get on any longer, Nunes said on Sunday.
CRUZ: Well, that's right. It's kind of strange how we got here. So Democrats have been having hearings, have been doing impeachment for months in the House. They brought in all sorts of witnesses. They blocked the minority from having any witnesses. And then, as soon as we get to the Senate, the Democratic talking point is, we want more witnesses. Never mind all the witnesses they called before. They want yet more. And they're trying to delay this. They're trying to drag this out. They want this trial to go on forever, because they have a political objective of attacking the president. What I have said and what I have urged the conference is, is, listen, if we go down the road of witnesses, we're not going to do what the House did. We're not going to have a one-sided kangaroo court. Instead, we're going to respect reciprocity. What does that mean? That means, if the prosecution gets a witness, the defense gets a witness. If the prosecution gets two, the defense gets two. That means, if the prosecution gets to call John Bolton, then the president gets to call Hunter Biden. And I got to tell you, the Democrats are terrified about seeing a witness like Hunter Biden testify, because they don't want to hear evidence of actual corruption, of corruption, potentially, of Joe Biden, corruption that occurred during the Obama administration. They blocked all those witnesses in the House. They're not going to succeed in blocking them in the Senate.
It is precisely that balance that the U.S. Department of Education was aiming for when it recently proposed rules, under its Title IX authority, governing how institutions of higher education and K-12 schools handle students' accusations of sexual misconduct.

It would be easy to dismiss President Trump's decision to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan as simply a political decision in which Trump is making good on a campaign promise. The reality is that it reflects what Americans want because they understand that a continued U.S. military presence Afghanistan no longer is in our national security interest— it's a conflict we don't need to fight, can't win, and can't afford.

Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.

GOLDBERG: But it's a problem. But that's not with the rank and file want, right? In the same way that the Rank and file of the Republican Party wants it to be an always Trump all Trump party, the rank and file of the Democratic Party wants it to be an always anti-Trump party here.

DERSHOWITZ: Look, it hurts me as a liberal Democrat--
In historical terms, elections in our era are cleaner than they have ever been. Fraud is much, much harder than it was in the bad old days of political machines and stuffed ballot boxes. The degree of scrutiny and oversight far, far surpasses anything our parents or grandparents would have known.
And I really experienced what most people in the West have never ever experienced -- life under a totalitarian regime.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Over the past few weeks, there have been several crucial disclosures of evidence that appear to further incriminate the President. Each disclosure bolstering the argument we Democrats have made for a trial that features the relevant witnesses and documents.
So, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. I am going to support him. Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.
And we'll find out what House Democrats hope to accomplish from congressional leader David Cicilline.
Those in the nursing home industry that I've talked to say they believed it to be mandatory and would've done anything to stop it from happening.

And Raymond Arroyo is here. Now, this is special. It's a Monday appearance for Raymond. But of course, when the Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais gave celebs some really great advice at the award show. Too bad they didn't listen. He's going to explain later in the show why something I wrote 17 years ago was a little bit ahead of its time.
WILLIAMS: Well, I think you have a situation here, just in pure political terms, where, one, it's only a shrinking Republican base that backs the president and you don't want to reward bullying, and that's what this comes down to. Secondly --
After Trump supporters breached the Capitol, forcing the building into lockdown and suspending for six hours the House and Senate election certification sessions, the president did urge them to leave in a peaceful manner, but he never condemned their actions and repeated his unfounded claims that he won the election in a landslide.
Guy Benson: Senator, I have to say, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, is frequently touted as a master tactician. I think sometimes that reputation has been earned. But I am still flabbergasted that they passed these articles of impeachment, rushed to do it before Christmas, and time was of the essence. It was very urgent for the well-being of our very republic that they do it as soon as possible, which is why they raced through everything and then shoved it in a drawer. Both articles in a drawer and it's been sitting there collecting dust now for weeks. It is 2020. Are you surprised that this continues to be the status quo? What exactly are they doing?
Tlaib should be who she is, and this time she should do it for a national audience in front of her 434 colleagues by repeating her speech in the U.S. Capitol and making it part of the official Congressional Record.

TRUMP: I am worried about it. Certainly, I am worried about it. Can you imagine, here we are split second timing executed like nobody has seen in many, many years on Soleimani. Can you imagine, they want us to call up and speak to crooked corrupt politician, Adam Schiff. Oh! Adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time. We have a shot at him right now. Could we meet so that we can get your approval Adam Schiff. And he'd say well, let's do it in a couple of days. Oh! OK. Let's meet in a couple - it doesn't work that way. Number one. Number two, they leak. Anything we give will be leaked immediately. You'll see breaking news. We're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something. And by the way, I'm not somebody that wants to attack. I probably could have attacked five times, 10 times having to do with Iran. I've been very guarded because I don't want to do that. But we may have to do something. We have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint. But hopefully it won't be necessary. We have tremendous sanctions. They're doing very poorly. They have riots all over their country and they could straighten out easy. But it's up to them. Whatever they want to be.

HANNITY: Great point. It's great point.

Mitt Romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that American voters elected Donald Trump.

I think for the senators, and I'm just not talking about the four that have been so much the focus of attention, for every senator, Democrat and Republican, I don't know how you can explain that you wanted a search for the truth in this trial and say you don't want to hear from a witness who had a direct conversation about the central allegation in the articles of impeachment, Schiff said on CNN's New Day.

FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo is at the White House with me for this exclusive interview today. He joins us now. Raymond, I think Trump looked like he was in fighting form today. Look, no one sleeps, he doesn't sleep, I don't sleep, nobody sleeps, but he is unbelievably resilient.
I will also say this, Chris -- I was very concerned by President Trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that Vladimir Putin's Russia had interfered in our 2016 election. There's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of President Trump to complement President Putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from Syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for President Putin.

The persecution of Christians has continued during the presidency of the so-called moderate Hassan Rouhani. An Islamic cleric, Rouhani has claimed that Christians have the same rights as other do, despite international reports detailing the violent repression of Iranian Christians. In a late December sermon in Tehran that was translated by The Middle East Media Research Institute, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a senior member of the Assembly of Experts, declared that Christians should honor Jesus and chant 'Death to America.'

Capt. Emily Rainey, 30, had already resigned from her commission before traveling to D.C. last week, CBS News first reported Monday.

The president, before and after his election, promised that Mexico is going to pay for the wall.

In light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.
Shielded by the mountains, Fordo is ringed by anti-aircraft guns and other fortifications. It is about the size of a football field, large enough to house 3,000 centrifuges, but small and hardened enough to lead U.S. officials to suspect it had a military purpose when they exposed the site publicly in 2009.

Trump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in Georgia or across the United States in the November election, and I don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in Georgia.
If he couldn't stand up to Obama, how would Romney have fared with Chinese President Xi Jinping?
Romney would not have pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. He would have been too polite to throw over the Iran nuke deal, or to confront the Chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our NATO allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put America first.
Officials are concerned the sika deer could carry chronic wasting disease, a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. If it does, there is potential that this species could spread the illness to the local white-tailed deer population.

If you're a senator, don't be surprised at the crush of reporters when you trek from your office through the underground tunnels en route to the Capitol for a vote on the floor. You'll have to run a gauntlet of scribes camped out in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building, staked out out in Capitol subway station and floating between the big Senate elevator bank and Ohio Clock Corridor off the floor. On the House side, reporters prowl in the Speaker's Lobby behind the House chamber and roam the hallway near the Will Rogers Statue. The press corps is as much a part of the fabric of Capitol Hill as the Members and staffers themselves.

Trump's ban from Twitter appeared to be part of what many have referred to as a purge of the social media giant's users, including former pro-Trump attorneys Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, as well as former National Security Adviser Gen.

Fox News previously reported that KFC has announced that its newest KFC Chicken Sandwich offering — its best ever — will be available in select markets starting today before expanding to all KFC restaurants in the nation by the end of February. The news follows similar announcements from competitors such as McDonald's, Shake Shack, Wendy's and even Burger King concerning details of their own chicken sandwiches, many of which closely resemble the Popeyes Chicken Sandwich that sent America into a frenzy upon its debut in 2019.

Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We -- even we here -- hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. – President Abraham Lincoln in a message to Congress, Dec. 1, 1862

Especially over the past decade, counterterrorism has not only encouraged inertia, but also has served as a smokescreen to put the U.S. in a de facto alliance with Iran, including the Obama administration providing Iranian-led militias with cover and support for ground operations, he added. The Trump administration has been slowly moving away from that, first through quiet acquiescence to ti Israeli strikes and now by retaliating directly against attacks by these militias. This change in posture is as necessary as it is overdue.

How does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.

Michael Anton: I don't know that I necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. You could interpret it as justified retaliation for all kinds of things that you've talked about earlier in the program that Iran has been doing without much of a response. So the main point I would want to make here is the Iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation, and when they finally do get pushback, they tend to back down and go into the turtle mode for a little while and that may yet happen again. We've seen that happen in the past. They haven't faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the Iran deal all around the Middle East, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they, I think, got overconfident and to some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that Soleimani went right into Iran and the airport -- sorry, into Iraq in the airport completely confident that he owned the place and that nothing would happen to him. So, I think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to maybe make the regime retreat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.

The execution of the decorated wrestler Mehdi Ali Hosseini is imminent. He is from Andimeshk in the province of Khuzestan, and was arrested in 2015 and charged with pre-meditated murder, supposedly committed during a group brawl. It is unclear whether Iran's regime forced Hosseini to confess to a crime he did not commit.
What is fascinating is, his team has already come out and said that this isn't his forte. He's not great at public speaking. So they're already downplaying the expectations just a little bit. So, hopefully -- they're hoping, even if he doesn't have a super strong showing, it won't hurt him too badly in the polls.
But he is wrong. Federal and state surveys and the New England Journal of Medicine report that teen marijuana use dropped a little in Colorado. Maybe there's something about legal businesses, with the dreary name dispensaries, that makes weed less sexy to kids.

Ocasio-Cortez had voted with Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by Pelosi.

WaPo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to quell a rising furor Sunday over whether Democratic lawmakers will seek to impeach President Trump, saying in an interview on CBS News's 'Sunday Morning' that the public has yet to hear the conclusions of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation. Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. … Pelosi's remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who said calls for Trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from Democrats' 'substantive agenda.' … Pelosi's remarks come amid days of Democratic infighting after newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) vowed … to 'impeach the motherf-----,' referring to Trump. Many of Tlaib's colleagues have cautioned against moving too quickly toward impeachment. Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) on Sunday told ABC News that impeaching Trump would be 'an unbelievably serious undertaking.'

Lawmakers make lots of promises about the bills they intend to pass. But in reality, there are only about 60 Members in both the House and Senate with the acumen to advance major legislation. That's not to say lawmakers can't sign on to and co-sponsor bills which move successfully across the House and Senate floors. But those capable of engineering a bill from scratch and shepherding it through final passage is a pretty limited group. Some are in fact freshmen. Some grow into that role down the road.

Trump repeats claims that drove mob in response to certification - Fox News: President Trump promised an 'orderly transition' on Jan. 20 after Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory. The certification came after a day in Washington, D.C., that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from Trump on Twitter that called for calm in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,' the statement read.

Rookie lawmakers also have a steep learning curve for how the institution works. What's the difference between a bill and a resolution? A bill can actually become law. Most resolutions aren't binding. What is the difference between the budget and appropriations? Budgets are broad, fiscal blueprints lacking the force of law. Budgets encompass how much money the federal government spends each year. Appropriations are live ammo. Congress dictates appropriations to fund the 12 annual spending bills and run the government each year. There's also the difference between discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is another word for an appropriation. In other words, Congress wields discretion over spending that money or not. Mandatory spending is on automatic pilot. Entitlements, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Congress doesn't allot an annual appropriation for these programs. Thus, that spending is mandatory.

I find it horrifying that anyone at USA Today would actually find it horrifying to save lives, to defend innocent people, because that's exactly what happened. I was also, and the reason to remind everyone that we have this video to go by, is because sadly, the church was live streaming their service that Sunday morning, as they always do, and it ultimately was captured. But you see in that video, Tucker, there are about five other law-abiding individuals who also draw their weapons, which is probably what would happen at my church. And I'm one of the law-abiding people who carry in my church, and we are encouraged to do so. But five other people also drew their lawfully carried, lawfully owned firearms, and they held. They watched and waited and took in everything that was happening before then, which indicates a level of training and a skillset that shouldn't horrify people. In fact, it should encourage individuals, because we were always told that if there is more than one firearm present in an area such as this, that there's a mass casualty incident or someone armed comes in to do murderous intent, that it would turn into the Wild West. Well, it didn't. It took Jack Harris one shot and six seconds to neutralize this threat. God bless them and God bless Texas.

There was a motion to dismiss in the Clinton impeachment trial. It failed, because there were nearly a dozen felony offenses identified as abuse of power by the independent counsel Ken Starr.

If there is an opening, whether it's Ginsburg or anybody else, I will urge the president to nominate a qualified conservative and hopefully those people will get through, that person will get through and I expect it to be along party lines.
SMITH: Well, I mean if you look at what happened - if you look at the sunset clauses meaning the different provisions built into the deal that were set to expire sometime after Barack Obama left the White House, that's very clear. It tells you what they were doing. They were passing it on to the next administration.
The speaker is grateful for the work of the Capitol Commission, but it does not have the authority to set policy in the Capitol, Lynn Afendoulis said in a news release.

Yeah, I agree the media have been completely and totally obsessed with everything Trump does.

It's the best I've ever seen so yes of course, he's going to be watching, I'm sure parts of it. But listen, these people are crazy. If you look at Pelosi, right? I mean Pelosi, I keep on saying is handing him the win. We're raising tremendous amounts of money. I was in Ohio all day, yesterday. The amount of people that are coming forward, saying, listen, these people do not represent us anymore. We can't relate to these people and you know people see it for what it is. My father's signing trade deals with China. He's signing USMCA. He's signing all these great deals. We've got the greatest economy in the history of the world.

And as always, we hope you join us right here for all of the breaking news, and the best analysis, and a little humor, you need that, too. So that's it from us tonight in Washington.
Benjamin Hall: Yes. Good evening, Tucker. As you point out, the whole region has been on high alert all day, waiting for some kind of retaliation from Iran. But actually, what we heard reports of in the last couple of hours are possible strikes by the U.S. These are unconfirmed, we've heard conflicting reports. But there are suggestions that two cars were hit just north of Baghdad a few hours ago and that they contained more Iranian-backed Shia militias, including a key finance facilitated close to Qasem Soleimani. But of course, it is Qasem Soleimani that everybody is talking about. The head of the Al Quds Force, some people say the second most powerful man in Iran and the man responsible for so many hundreds of U.S. deaths. He was killed leaving Baghdad Airport early this morning, having flown in from Lebanon. A U.S. Reaper drone was waiting to take him out. And alongside him, the man who was in charge of the storming of the U.S. embassy. Five others also killed there. People are saying now that this strike may really severely strain U.S.-Iraqi relations. And in fact, the Iraqi prime minister spoke out earlier today and didn't mince his words. He said he condemned the targeting killing as a violation of the terms which underpin the U.S. troop presence in this country. And he went on to say that he has submitted a formal request for parliament to convene in order to adopt necessary measures to protect Iraq's dignity and sovereignty.
And I'll, you know, just add one data point to what you were talking about earlier, John Bolton once suggested on Fox News that the Russian hack of the DNC [Democratic National Committee] was a false flag operation that had been conducted by the Obama administration, he said. So, you add that kind of thinking to [former U.S. attorney] Joe diGenova and you have another big dose of unreality in the White House.

The decision by the Trump administration not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal in 2017 was undoubtedly the right call and in America's best interests. However, even if the United States never withdrew from the deal, the sunset provisions poorly negotiated in the agreement would now be upon us, meaning Iran would be well on its way to obtaining a nuclear weapon all while having violated not only the spirit but the letter of the deal.
Also a couple of protesters on the hand. Unlikely to be an issue when he gets here, where Mr. Trump will be seeking the support and, of course, the votes in election 2020 of ordinary farmers.

Some observers earlier predicted she would be promoted to a full member of the bureau. It wasn't immediately clear why the 32-year-old lost her Politburo post. But given her direct lineage to the ruling Kim family, some experts caution against speculating her political clout has diminished. Last year, state media said she was in charge of relations with rival South Korea as well.
Texas Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, speaking at a news conference after President Trump's visit to McAllen, Texas, later in the day, charged that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party was to blame for the partial shutdown and that no compromise seemed likely as a result.

Earlier in the day, CNN reported that the letter amounted to a threat against Bolton. But sources told Fox News this was not a threat, saying the letter merely points out that there is top secret information contained in the manuscript that cannot be released to the public.
Chris Wallace: I want to pick up on this, because here was another one of your tweets in the last couple of days. The administration's reckless policy over the last three years has brought us to the brink, but the president -- and you just heard Secretary Pompeo say, no, it was President Obama who brought us to the brink; it was the Obama nuclear deal which funneled billions of dollars back into the regime that they used to spread their brand of terror across the Middle East, and also, it was the Obama administration's decision to focus exclusively on the nuclear program and to ignore all the other malign activity by Iran throughout the region.
Biden insisted again that Hunter did nothing wrong, but this time appeared to fault his staff for not cluing him in that there could be concerns about his son's involvement with the foreign company that had been under investigation while Biden was in office and dealing with Ukraine policy.

While the president's approval rating among Republicans has stayed in the stratosphere -- it stood at 86% in a Fox News national poll and at 90% in an NPR/PBS/Marist survey, which were both conducted in early December, and nine out of 10 Republicans gave him a thumbs up in a USA Today/Suffolk University national poll conducted two weeks ago – this week's events appear to be taking a toll.

Somehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp – like an aide's classified mail on the laptop of a sex offender or huge payments and contributions from Russian-connected sources – was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.
But the opposite has been the effect. It is now unsafe, unhealthy, unaffordable, and for many, unlivable. It's a dystopia in a lot of ways.
WALLACE: But Bill Barr -- wait a minute -- Bill Barr says that that kind of conversation, even if it's to the whole world, not getting on the phone with Bill Barr undercuts his authority and makes it impossible for him, Bill Barr, to do his job.
It would be difficult if not impossible, Dershowitz said, to determine that a president has acted with corrupt motive, given that countless presidents inevitably consider both the national interest and their personal political gain when making decisions. Rarely do presidents act with purely corrupt or purely noble motives, he said. Often, he went on, presidents want to help themselves but in doing so believe they are also helping the country.

With the nation's second-longest government shutdown in history entering its 17th day and rhetoric reaching an apparent inflection point, media prognosticators and political analysts on Tuesday raised a series of pivotal but unanswered questions. Will some networks choose not to air Trump's speech in full, or attempt to fact-check his statements live?
They just came off an impeachment issue in the House, and I think what is actually happening is Nancy Pelosi is sitting here saying, oh, my God, this was so bad. This was actually worse than I thought it was, but I had to do it to appease my left. And now let me just hold it out here and play political. If I was one of her 31 members who were in Trump districts, and after she went up and got real solemn and said this is duty and our solemn, sworn --

Indeed, the question that has long dogged such proposals is how to pay for it all. But the answer has typically avoided specifics, instead arguing that America has found ways to pay for other gargantuan costs in the past. In a follow-up FAQ, one explainer says the plan would be funded by the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars.

Congressman Green, when he said we can't beat him, we have to impeach him. And they all know that. They're making things up. This is the craziest thing anyone has ever seen. And the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes. They're not even allowed to be put in. It's a disgrace.

Look, I think there are many people in the Democratic Party who are looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. But the question in my judgment is his record. I mean, I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he's apologized. I get that. I'm for forgiveness. But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.

In terms of quality and quantity, we are going to be just about No. 1 by the time we finish -- No. 1 of any president, any administration, Trump said in early November, noting that George Washington may have technically appointed more judges. At the time, he was celebrating his 150th federal judge.

CRUZ: Hunter Biden had zero experience in oil and gas. It's not like he was a geologist or geophysicist. He was getting that money, the obvious inference is, because his daddy was vice president. And Joe Biden is on video at the Council of Foreign Relations bragging that he blocked a billion dollars in foreign loans and foreign aid to Ukraine until they fired the prosecutor who was potentially investigating Burisma, the company on which Hunter Biden sat on the board. When -- if the Biden family is profiting to the tunes of millions of dollars, the president is entirely justified to say, let's investigate and find out what happened. That's why Hunter Biden is such an important witness and why the Democrats don't want to focus on, what was the evidence of actual corruption? I expect to hear a lot from that -- from the White House defense team this week.

The good news for Joe Biden is he says is, don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And he'd be running against somebody who thinks that Frederick Douglass has a great future, who thinks that an American invented the wheel, who cannot pronounce the word anonymous or origin.
Santorum, Paul and Cain will undoubtedly be throwing rhetorical red meat to the South Carolina audience. Pawlenty has never shown the ability to compete with any of them as a performer and a showman. His strength is a good record of conservative policies from his tenure as governor of Minnesota. If he simply gives direct answers to the questions and does not get drawn into the contest for who can be the most outrageous conservative provocateur, it might be enough to make him a winner.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on his permanent Twitter suspension.

INGRAHAM: Well, apparently Mitt Romney doesn't think so and I don't know about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, but if they could put aside their dislike for some of what the President says or does for the Constitution and what's good for the country, they'd get thumbs up from me and a lot of other people. So, gentlemen, thanks so much.
If you intentionally destroy evidence, that is a crime. If you make a statement in court saying the evidence is not available and it is, that is also a crime, said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice.

We will not tolerate any disturbance onboard our aircraft or at any of the airports we serve, the statement later added.
OBAMA: And if it can change a nation, it can change the world.
Sen. Cornyn: Well, I think it's irresponsible and I think it defies reality. I mean, the truth is it's the Democrats who are trying to change the subject and trying to create a further circus like atmosphere here in the Senate because of their lack of success in dealing with this impeachment matter in the House. This is obviously a totally separate matter. I respect people what Democrats like Joe Lieberman and Jay Johnson, who both said in recent days that this is well within the president's authority and a necessary act. And I also respect great leaders like Ryan Crocker, who today I think is in The New York Times, wrote a piece about why this was within the president's authority, why it was necessary. And it was a former CIA director and CENTCOM commander, David Petraeus, who made the point that this is more significant in terms of our fight against radical Islam than was the death of Osama bin Laden. So this was a a very big deal. And I think the president is to be commended for his decisive action in the face of a real threat.
WALLACE: I want to ask you a specific question, Congressman, why is a wall immoral? I'm not asking why it's ineffective or why you think the money could be spent better, but the speaker keeps saying the wall is immoral. There's a wall or a fence around the White House. People build walls around their homes.

Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley on Friday reacted to the permanent suspension of President Trump's Twitter account, describing it as an instance of silencing of the kind that happens in communist China.
TRUMP: I think it cheapened the word impeachment. I think impeachment is a very ugly word, but I think this cheapen the word impeachment. I think Nancy Pelosi and Schiff, because he's corrupt. I mean he's the guy stands up at the United States Congress and repeats a conversation except it was a fraud. He made up a conversation. He was saying my conversation and it was totally wrong and he knew it. He said, don't call me, I'll call you. That's from the Godfather. That's a mafia statement. I never said that. He said eight times quid pro quo. It was no times. He made up a conversation and repeated it in front of Congress and because he has immunity, we can't do anything about it. I'd like to say, why did you do that? Now, these people are frauds and it's very bad. No, they've cheapened the word impeachment. It's a bad word to start off with. I really say, it's an ugly word. To me, it's a very ugly word, but maybe it played to our benefit.

Kim's latest nuclear threats were likely meant to pressure President-elect Joe Biden to resume diplomacy and make concessions after he takes office next week. But some experts say Biden, who has criticized Kim's made-for-camera summits with President Donald Trump, won't do so. They say Kim's new economic plan lacks substance, and that much of North Korea's chronic economic difficulties are a result of its decades-long mismanagement, self-imposed isolation and U.S.-led sanctions imposed because of his nuclear program.

What? We're not going to oppose boycotts of Israel because Trump wants to do a deal on the border wall? How is that governing in a mature way? I'm sure the new anti-Semitic wing of the new Democratic party was thrilled about this development in the Senate. But most Americans are not.

At the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collective—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.
The principle driving it is an old American value, and that's self-sufficiency, USCIS Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli told Fox News in an interview last year.

Obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.

Chris Van Hollen: Well, first of all, they didn't ignore it, but the Obama administration correctly observed that a nuclear-armed Iran would be even more dangerous than an Iran that did not have nuclear weapons. And so, what this administration did was they ripped up that agreement, essentially divided us from our allies, and the result has been this increased actual activity from Iran in the region.

We fought ISIS in Syria and then for some reason stuck around. We're still there. We joined humanitarian missions in Lebanon and Somalia. Our special forces have been quietly fighting in Yemen, Pakistan, Niger, who knows where all else. Many other places. In every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. The benefits? Often, they've been non-existent. A lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. Certainly, they did. Hope that makes you feel better. What do the American people think about all of this? Not that anyone cares. Well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. The killing of Soleimani happened just last night. But just five months ago after months of supposed Iranian provocation. American's didn't seem to view Iran as a major concern, not even close. In a Gallop poll taken last August, just 18 percent of Americans said that they backed military force to shut down Iran's nuclear program. Seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. So, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual Americans don't enter the equation at all. They're immaterial. In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well. He vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home, which are growing.

His denial about their role in our election then and now all roads lead to - and sometimes I wonder about Mitch McConnell to what's he - why is he an accomplice to all of that.
Although multiple elected Republicans have raised concerns about what they claim are ballot irregularities, Trump did not win the election, let alone by a landslide. On Thursday, Congress certified the Electoral College results, validating President-Elect Biden's spot in the White House.

TRUMP: By the way, you know how bad the Iran deal was? The Iran deal, I did a great thing getting out of the Iran deal. They gave 150 billion, they gave 1.8 and forget that. You couldn't do inspections of the most important locations. And you know another big thing, they have the right to do ballistic missiles. We couldn't go into areas and look; we'd have to give massive notice. So, if they were doing something that they could clean them up, it was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now once it expired, they have an absolute clear, unstopped path of nuclear weapons. Unstopped. In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen that deal expires and you know what? Once it expires, you can't do what I did. I mean because they have a deal that says once it expires, they can do what they want to do. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. That's what I'm doing.

Fox News: As Bernie Sanders gears up for a likely second run at the Democratic presidential nomination, the Vermont senator finds himself facing a much higher level of scrutiny than he ever endured in 2016. … The allegations of harassment and sexism in Sanders' 2016 campaign – which emerged in reports last week by The New York Times and Politico – are raising new questions even among some of Sanders' strongest supporters. … And the home-state Barre Montpelier Times Argus newspaper just published a blistering editorial that began, 'Bernie Sanders should not run for president. In fact, we beg him not to.' The editorial listed several points, including the sexual harassment allegations, while noting they are not directed at him personally. But more broadly, the piece warned… 'It is one thing to start a revolution, but at a certain point you need to know when to step out of the way and let others carry the water for you.'

Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the mantle, while Tlaib is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).

You saw the rise of Buttigieg, Biden with considerable strength. There are a lot of people out there that still support and are giving money to Bernie Sanders.

MARIE HARF, ANALYST: Absolutely. And I -- I think I was one of those Democrats that underestimated her ability to win back the speakership with the kind of numbers she got. The fact that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez voted for her in the end is just a symbol of the fact that she was able to win back that speakership in a way that showed her strength and her legislative ability.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think he's going to have to answer for that and speak to it.
WHITAKER: I think there's a lot of excitement, especially from the media that's going to cover this. They want fireworks. They want folks arguing.

They don't - you know they have a constituency back home that they need to be impressive to and to get re-elected. But fundamentally, the Democrats from the House have the burden of persuasion and if they can't prove their case in their initial 24 or so hours that they get, I don't expect that there's going to be an appetite for most senators to go further with documents or witnesses.

As a result, officials in the three states each sent two slates of electoral votes to Congress: One intentionally inaccurate, the other accurate but the result of brutal coercion. Lawmakers deadlocked. The Democrat-controlled House backed their man, New York Gov. Samuel Tilden, and the Republican Senate stood strong for theirs, Ohio Gov. Rutherford Hayes. That left 20 electoral votes in limbo and the presidency dangling by a thread.

We fought ISIS in Syria and then for some reason stuck around. We're still there. We joined humanitarian missions in Lebanon and Somalia. Our special forces have been quietly fighting in Yemen, Pakistan, Niger, who knows where all else. Many other places. In every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. The benefits? Often, they've been non-existent. A lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. Certainly, they did. Hope that makes you feel better. What do the American people think about all of this? Not that anyone cares. Well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. The killing of Soleimani happened just last night. But just five months ago after months of supposed Iranian provocation. American's didn't seem to view Iran as a major concern, not even close. In a Gallop poll taken last August, just 18 percent of Americans said that they backed military force to shut down Iran's nuclear program. Seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. So, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual Americans don't enter the equation at all. They're immaterial. In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well.

But make no mistake: Any attack upon a single U.S. aircraft carrier by long-range aircraft, cruise missiles or ballistic missiles would surely generate a response against the bases from which those weapons were launched, the sensors associated with them and the command-and-control nodes that directed them, and then the United States would turn its attention on the Chinese naval and merchant fleet.

This is another sign of how the Israeli government sees in the Trump administration an unprecedented opportunity to advance goals long rejected by the international community, said Ben White, journalist, and author of Cracks in the Wall: Beyond Apartheid in Palestine/Israel.

Iranian leaders don't want to reenter the JCPOA as it is for their love of humanity. They want to reenter the JCPOA as it is because they rolled U.S. negotiators at the table to secure this agreement in 2015, and then made out like bandits with the sanctions relief. The current nuclear deal would allow Iran to continue its other non-nuclear hostile activities, and still have nuclear weapons in short order.

And the sooner, the better, so he can get the party back on.
WALLACE: So you think you could legitimately beat Donald Trump?
But not just securing the border, but fixing the immigration system as a whole; it's completely broken. The president wants to make sure we look at all of the different things, loopholes we can close, to make that better.

Dershowitz continued: If he wasn't running for president, he's a has-been. He is the former vice president of the United States. Okay, big deal. But if he's running for president, that's an enormous big deal. So the difference the House managers would make is whether the president's in his first term or his second term, whether he's running for reelection or not running for reelection. I think they would have to concede that if he was not running for reelection, this would not be a corrupt motive, or it would be a mixed motive, but leaning on the side of national interest. If he is running for reelection, suddenly that turns it into an impeachable offense!

Josh Holmes: Well, I don't think that's inconsistent at all. I mean, I think his overarching policy as Secretary Pompeo articulated very clearly is to remove America from these endless wars and these conflicts in Syria, the conflicts in Iraq and beyond, but that also cannot override immediate security threats. You need to be responsive to that and I will just say, I'm totally stunned at the notion that somehow America is the one that is bringing this to a higher escalation level. The president's critics may not have been paying attention to what's happened over the last couple of years, but just because they're more focused on trying to impeach the president of the United States than the health and well-being of American soldiers in Iraq, doesn't mean that things aren't happening. This guy has tried -- has killed over 600 American soldiers, all right? Just last week, we watched him storm the embassy in Baghdad. Now, how America is the aggressor here is beyond me but what they did is for the first time in a long time, and I'll argue that the president has been extremely reluctant to engage in this kind of thing, but first time in a long time tell Iran not anymore. You're not going to be attacking American assets or American personnel without severe repercussions and I think that's a great thing for this country.

You will find below our first list of contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. There are 35 individuals who have at least expressed interest in running. Some have already filed papers, some have set deadlines for themselves, while others seem more likely to be just musing in the media.
TERRELL: Laura, can I just make one point?
It is unconstitutional for a statute to take away the president's sole authority over foreign policy. The only limitation on the president's authority is he can't declare war. Other than that, he can decide the Jerusalem embassy for Israel without congressional authorization. He can decide who not to give money to.
INGRAHAM: This is a game we can play all day long.

MARIE HARF, ANALYST: Absolutely. And I -- I think I was one of those Democrats that underestimated her ability to win back the speakership with the kind of numbers she got. The fact that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez voted for her in the end is just a symbol of the fact that she was able to win back that speakership in a way that showed her strength and her legislative ability.

While Barack Obama may not share the Nixon pedigree, he and his White House are the closest thing to the Nixon regime of any that we have seen since then -- both in the extent of their paranoia and their willingness to suppress the truth and push the boundaries of law.

Beverly, the one thing you hear is that health care worked for us. It wasn't a wedge issue. It became the issue. And so, this way, we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about the jobs gains and everything else going on in the Trump economy. They're noteworthy. They're hard to argue again. So we're going to focus on this stuff, and maybe do better.
I think that it's going to ring hollow for him. But I think health care is a winning issue for Democrats across the board. We know that the president's handling of health care, he's at about 30 -- in the 30 percentile area in terms of approval for the way he's handled health care.
Ricardel most notably butted heads with Mattis while she served in the Pentagon helping staff top positions following Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election. Mattis wanted to bring in top officials to the Pentagon who were not Republicans, and Ricardel made moves to block Mattis's picks.

Thanks to stories like this one, Americans are warming shockingly to socialism. Six months from now, a socialist could be the Democratic nominee for president. In a few years, this could easily be a socialist country. What would that look like? Well, of course it would be a disaster. Socialism doesn't work. It never has worked, especially not in sprawling, diverse countries like this one. Under a socialist regime, hundreds of millions of Americans would see their lives get dramatically worse, while demagogic morons like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would become vastly more powerful. That's socialism. You think America is stratified and unequal now? Wait till we get a socialist system. It will be so much worse. That's coming, by the way and at high speed. Why? Because mindless Chamber of Commerce libertarianism has allowed greed and stupidity to flourish in corporate boardrooms and unless we rein that immediately, right now, we're going to lose the system that made this country great. As of tonight, America is sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East, but the Iraqi government may soon say that they are not welcome there. So, what will happen next? We'll tell you as our coverage of the Iran crisis continues.

INGRAHAM: Iran's Supreme Leader -- I don't like saying that, but I said it -- today, made a rare appearance in public to call Trump a clown who can't be trusted, and praised the missile strikes against U.S. forces. The comments came two weeks after President Trump ordered that killing of Qasem Soleimani via air strike, and in the days since, of course, Democrats and the media have sworn up and down that this was ill-advised and had only united Iran. Is that really the case? We recently spoke to Iranian-American activist Erica Kasraie, whose viral video explaining how actual Iranian citizens feel has amassed nearly 5.6 million views. We started by asking her to respond to this from some in the media.

Many of the attackers appeared dressed for a riot – suggesting some element of planning, said Jordan Strauss, managing director of business intelligence and investigations at Kroll, a division of New York-based risk consultancy Duff & Phelps. But I suspect that it was a combination, with some individuals having announced themselves as having come to storm the Capitol or incite some sort of revolution. It would surprise me if some otherwise peaceful protesters were not swept up in the fever of the moment and decided to cross the threshold from peaceful protesters to criminals on the spot.
Thursday's incident follows the airline industry publicly announcing larger changes to current policy in the wake of Wednesday's rioting at the U.S. Capitol, during which a mob of Trump supporters breached the entrance and stormed the building.

Police confirmed that U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick was among those who died of injuries sustained during the riots.
Ocasio-Cortez wants to impose her radical, socialist vision on every single American citizen, a fact most of those in the mainstream media who have spent the past several months fawning over her refuse to tell the public.

If the United States does indeed build a wall along its southern border and then monitors it effectively, it may succeed in curbing illegal immigration, but it will not end it.

Jim Antle: Right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. And so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the Republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in Afghanistan and Syria, and the vast majority of Republican senators voted to rebuke him. And in the case of Syria, we're talking about a war that Congress never voted to authorize in the first place. Well, here we are in Iraq, and we have most Republican senators saying that they don't want Congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against Iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. I think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of Cold War 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, Republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing Democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped Trump win in 2016.

At the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. I'm one of the people who think we have to wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.
Israel captured the West Bank and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war, territories the Palestinians want for their future state. Nearly 500,000 Israelis live in settlements scattered across the West Bank.

A draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.
Sources tell Fox News that Colorado Republican Sen. Cory Gardner remains worried about whether an extended shutdown and dysfunction in Washington could hurt the U.S.'s credit rating, which is based on factors that include politics, monetary policy, economic indicators, and externalities. The county last lost its top-notch credit status in 2011 after Standard and Poor's lowered it from AAA to AA+, amid a showdown over the debt ceiling.
Shouting profanities, beating back police officers, destroying property, intimidating elected officials… These are not forms of political argument, no matter who uses them. They're just an ungodly power grab.
But he knows that if he shows up he'll be targeted by all the other candidates who want to bring down the biggest player. And he will have to endure question after question from the Fox team and his opponents about creating a universal health care plan in Massachusetts that closely mirrors the president's controversial health care reform plan. So his strategy is to let the little guys fight it out before they get to challenge him.
All that we're about to show you, it's false. They've never been held accountable. They've never apologized.

President Trump is a man who is tough and outspoken. But he also has a kind heart. And this is an act of kindness. And I also believe it's the beginning of the process to actually turn an injustice into a justice.
But Xi and his followers have watched their diplomatic, economic and military initiatives come up short, engendering increased resistance from other Indo-Pacific nations rather than the realignment China had expected. Now the Trump administration's trade tariffs threaten to destabilize the Chinese economy, resulting in a cascade failure of Xi Jinping's broader strategy and threatening to undermine the legitimacy of the Communist Party, hence the stronger and more strident attacks.
We've see how fluid it is. Of course I don't have billions of dollars of my own money to pour into the airwaves.

The Fed claims quantitative easing is to save the economy…when the real goals are printing enough fake money to pay for $3.7 trillion in government handout bribes to Obama's voters…and making billionaire crony capitalists like Warren Buffett far richer last year, by turning Wall Street into a fixed craps game that makes bankers and CEO's filthy rich…while our children and unborn grandchildren owe back trillions in debt. By the way Obama's buddy Warren Buffett made $12.7 billion last year. How'd you do?

GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. I would also note, that President Obama did make public comments about the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from Rodney King, right? So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.

TEXAS COUPLE: GOD 'PURPOSEFULLY CONNECTED' US TO KIDS FOUND CHAINED IN HORRIFIC ABUSE CASE
WALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you Sunday.
It's time to stop playing with the voters of this country. It's time to stop playing in the destruction of democracy that they did in the House of Representatives. They broke every rule to get here. It's now time -- if you have such a strong case, then Adam Schiff, I think what they need to find is go after to the Wizard of Oz. They need to find the Wizard and find some courage. They need to find heart, because they've lost it complete. If they have a case, then make their case. If not, shut up.
The last straw was when the Romney campaign told Ric to pretend he wasn't present during a conference call he arranged. In the aftermath, the New York Times reported of the bizarre scene, It was the biggest moment yet for Mitt Romney's foreign policy team: a conference call last Thursday, dialed into by dozens of news outlets from around the globe, to dissect and denounce President Obama's record on national security, reported the newspaper in May 2012, But Richard Grenell, the political strategist who helped organize the call and was specifically hired to oversee such communications, was conspicuously absent, or so everyone thought…
As a result, ISIS has been plotting attacks against civilians trying to flee the war zone.
Kevin Corke: Over the weekend, Iraq's prime minister strongly criticized the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and prominently took part in the massive anti-U.S. protest in Baghdad. White House officials said it was Soleimani who directed the recent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and was responsible for killing hundreds of Americans worldwide. In Iran, a massive funeral procession through several cities to honor the slain general who many considered the second-most powerful man in the Islamic Republic. Overnight, President Trump tweeting, If Iran attacks an American base or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way. And threatening to strike 52 Iranian sites representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif responding, Targeting cultural sites is a war crime, and Iran's telecommunications minister called Trump a terrorist in a suit.
The president, in a tweet, called the meeting a total waste of time and appeared to confirm that he left after Pelosi's answer.

WALLACE: Karl, he was talking there specifically about the president and -- and firing back at the policies of the president you worked for, Bush 43. But where are we on Syria right now? Because the president said we're going to get out right away. Then John Bolton, the national security advisor, said, well, it depends on what happens with the Kurds and ISIS. Now we hear the Pentagon is pulling equipment out. Do you know where we are?

The variant is said to be more transmissible than COVID-19 — though as of now, it's not thought to be more virulent or resistant to vaccines and treatment. That said, a new study suggests who may be most at risk for contracting B.1.1.7: Those under 20 years of age.
Chris Wallace: You have been tweeting ever since the Soleimani takedown. Here's one of them. The Constitution makes clear that a president may not go to war without authorization from Congress, and we have not authorized war with Iran. But, Senator, the White House says this is not war, that Soleimani was a terrorist, and this was an act of self-defense, which a commander-in-chief can always take.

With Shanahan moving up from deputy secretary to acting secretary, the Pentagon's budget chief, David Norquist, has been chosen to fill in temporarily as the deputy secretary, according to Pentagon spokesman Tom Crosson.
Schiff rose to claim that Republicans surely would have impeached Obama if he sought to tie financial aid to a foreign country to secure a probe into Mitt Romney; he did not address Dershowitz's argument that such an impeachment, too, would be improper, especially if there was some evidence of potential overseas misconduct by Romney.

Mo Elleithee: Yeah, it's interesting. One of the president's rationales for withdrawing from the Iran deal was that by doing so and imposing these crippling economic sanctions on the regime, it would bring the regime to its knees. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. The regime has become more and more emboldened and has done -- has been escalating its rhetoric. Look, my concern here is, and as others have said, is what are the ramifications regionally? This was not our first opportunity to go after this guy.

More recently, walls have been used to keep warring populations separated. Walls have long been a staple of counterinsurgency. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the British emplaced the so-called peace walls in Belfast to separate Republican Catholic neighborhoods from Loyalist Protestant ones in an effort to tamp down sectarian violence. Similarly, during the Iraq War, the United States military relied extensively on giant concrete barrier walls both to combat the improvised explosive device threat and later to help isolate sectarian hot spots, making concrete barriers one of the unsung heroes of the so-called Surge.

Thankfully, the president recently held a news conference with several Border Patrol officials, giving them a chance to tell the public about the critical need for physical barriers at the border.
Transportation secretary to resign in protest - USA Today: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will resign from her position, she announced Thursday. Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is the first Cabinet secretary to resign after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to halt the counting of Electoral College votes. 'Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,' Chao said in a statement. 'As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.' Chao noted her office would continue to help Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for transportation secretary, transition into his role.

INGRAHAM: Iran was also boasting that it was gradually eroding any thought of really abiding by this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. Over the summer, they continued to talk, we're not going to be doing this. So we couldn't trust them, never could, despite Obama's idealistic, naive approach.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is one of the rising stars of the new Democrat-led Congress and the left's latest media darling.

Kim has pushed to simultaneously achieve economic growth and the expansion of his nuclear deterrent. After claiming to have achieved the ability to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear weapons, he launched high-stakes summits with Trump in 2018 to win sanctions relief and revive the economy. But the diplomacy collapsed the following year after Trump rejected Kim's offer to get extensive sanctions relief in return for a limited denuclearization step.

While the president's approval rating among Republicans has stayed in the stratosphere -- it stood at 86% in a Fox News national poll and at 90% in an NPR/PBS/Marist survey, which were both conducted in early December, and nine out of 10 Republicans gave him a thumbs up in a USA Today/Suffolk University national poll conducted two weeks ago – this week's events appear to be taking a toll.
The Senate races, pitting appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler against Warnock and GOP incumbent Sen. David Perdue against Ossoff, had not yet been called.
Americans also benefit from lower energy costs beyond just the price of gas. Economists suggest that for energy to be considered affordable, it must cost less than six percent of household income. Lower energy costs mean less energy poverty for Americans on fixed incomes. Contrast this energy wealth to the situation in other industrialized nations such as Great Britain, where thousands of pensioners die each winter because they cannot afford to adequately heat their homes. Oil is an input cost on all goods, whether it is used directly in the production process as in the case of plastics or indirectly through transport costs such as with Florida oranges. Lower costs of basic goods help keep inflation low which disproportionately benefits price-sensitive shoppers.

Romney excoriated the president in his op-ed by challenging his leadership and claiming he hasn't risen to the mantle of the presidency.

CAVUTO: Another thing that's interesting, Jason, from the Democratic perspective -- you're the expert here -- that the idea that Michael Bloomberg has not to really pick apart the economy and the numbers and the jobs gains and the markets, but to talk about, with that success and the money you can raise from these who've done very well, to get to these other goals.

SLOTKIN: I think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that I love. And, for me, that's critically important. I don't like policy by Twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. If we're only anti-Trump, we are not doing our job.

That simply would have never happened in past years, when the policy typically was that officials would go at least 13 days between working games in the same city and six days between seeing the same team after reffing one of its games.

Biden reportedly will name R.I. governor to lead Commerce - WSJ: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo as his commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California economic development official, to lead the Small Business Administration, according to people familiar with the matter. Ms. Raimondo was elected as the first female governor of Rhode Island in 2014. Before that, she served as the state's general treasurer. She also led the Democratic Governors Association from 2018 to 2019. Before she entered public service, Ms. Raimondo co-founded Point Judith Capital, a venture-capital firm. Ms. Guzman was a senior official at the SBA during the Obama administration, serving as deputy chief of staff. In 2019, she became the director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she helped implement a grant program for businesses affected by the pandemic.

SPALDING: I actually think the Iranian leadership is going to have to take a reassessment based on the strike. So, whatever language the President uses, it kind of reinforces this sense of unpredictability on - so they don't know where the line is. And if they don't know where the line is, they have to reassess. And I think you're going to see a level of stability as a result, not just in Iran. I think it sends a message to Beijing, to Moscow and Pyongyang that they need to pay attention to what the President is saying.

But let's talk about the Democrats and how serious they are about foreign interference in our elections. I'll go to my book, briefly, if I may.

If the United States does indeed build a wall along its southern border and then monitors it effectively, it may succeed in curbing illegal immigration, but it will not end it. Walls cannot prevent people from overstaying their visas or being smuggled in another way. And if history is any precedent, illegal immigrants may attempt to tunnel under the wall, go over it or breach it some other way.

Chris Wallace: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. The deadly strike on Iranian general Qassem Soleimani marks a major escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran raising fears of all-out war, the U.S. sending more than 4,000 additional troops to the Middle East this week as Iran promises to seek revenge.

Such a move still could require the president to declare a national emergency in order to access those funds to build a wall, because they were earmarked for a different purpose. The discussions with the Corps suggest the White House is closely looking at the possibility of declaring such an emergency, as Trump has floated repeatedly in recent days.

The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership. McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills a time-wasting act of political posturing and said that a resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.

So in Iran, children are forced to chant Death to America and Death to Israel. So that kind of indoctrination starts very young. And so what you see in this picture is children who are being forced to mourn. And so this is the regime's propaganda that they circulate in social media.

And then there is the frontrunner, Joe, what state am I in, Biden. Other than remind everyone that he was Obama's vice president for either years, what exactly is he doing to excite the Democrat base? He is a human gaffe- omatic, pulled his string and some crazy nonsense will come out.
The president's account was suspended Wednesday night after he posted a video with a message for protesters who had stormed the Capitol earlier. After violence that led to multiple deaths, Trump told them to go home, but maintained that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.

Jim Antle: Right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. And so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the Republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in Afghanistan and Syria, and the vast majority of Republican senators voted to rebuke him. And in the case of Syria, we're talking about a war that Congress never voted to authorize in the first place. Well, here we are in Iraq, and we have most Republican senators saying that they don't want Congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against Iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. I think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of Cold War 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, Republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing Democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped Trump win in 2016.
When it comes to climate change, we need to advance policies that don't ask Americans to choose between their jobs and clean air and water, Swalwell told Fox News this week. We can do that by greening the grid with investments in renewable energy and a wage and skills guarantee for any displaced worker.
But I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.

INGRAHAM: They're not even making any sense. Yes, he is a bad guy, but. If Ronald Reagan was the great communicator, Trump could be the great revealer. At every turn he is forcing Democrats to stumble all over their words, completely contradict what they said five minutes ago, and also the media, they are showing their true colors as well.

It is this battle that will shape the future of the Republican Party over the next four years. Trump himself will push the narrative that he was robbed as he positions himself as a GOP kingmaker and teases the possibility of another run.

First, Comey's tweets and comments reveal that he despised Trump, and so the self-serving memos he was making and then leaking about his every contact with the president were likely part of an effort to build a case against Trump. We learned that the FBI was wiretapping a number of Trump campaign officials largely on the basis of the Steele dossier. We learned that the dossier was authored by an operative who hated Trump and paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign via hidden payments to their law firm. And we learned that Comey sent FBI agents to question General Michael Flynn about perfectly legal conversations they already had transcripts of, without following White House protocol, in a deliberate effort to entrap him.

Thanks to stories like this one, Americans are warming shockingly to socialism. Six months from now, a socialist could be the Democratic nominee for president. In a few years, this could easily be a socialist country. What would that look like? Well, of course it would be a disaster. Socialism doesn't work. It never has worked, especially not in sprawling, diverse countries like this one. Under a socialist regime, hundreds of millions of Americans would see their lives get dramatically worse, while demagogic morons like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would become vastly more powerful. That's socialism. You think America is stratified and unequal now? Wait till we get a socialist system. It will be so much worse. That's coming, by the way and at high speed. Why? Because mindless Chamber of Commerce libertarianism has allowed greed and stupidity to flourish in corporate boardrooms and unless we rein that immediately, right now, we're going to lose the system that made this country great. As of tonight, America is sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East, but the Iraqi government may soon say that they are not welcome there. So, what will happen next?

TRUMP: By the way, you know how bad the Iran deal was? The Iran deal, I did a great thing getting out of the Iran deal. They gave 150 billion, they gave 1.8 and forget that. You couldn't do inspections of the most important locations. And you know another big thing, they have the right to do ballistic missiles. We couldn't go into areas and look; we'd have to give massive notice. So, if they were doing something that they could clean them up, it was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now once it expired, they have an absolute clear, unstopped path of nuclear weapons. Unstopped. In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen that deal expires and you know what? Once it expires, you can't do what I did. I mean because they have a deal that says once it expires, they can do what they want to do. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon.

Especially the U.S. with its rich history of religious freedom and tolerance is seen by so many Iranians from all walks of life as a shining example. To back Iranian Christians is an important step to achieve freedom for all Iranians.

WALTZ: No, I don't think we are. I think this was a response to stop the series of escalations. The President's made it clear that if they escalate again, our response will be overwhelming. The last thing the Iranian regime wants is a war with the United States because the thing they value the most is their own survival and they know they would be destroyed in such a conflict. They have in a whole history of escalating right up to the edge and when faced with strength, they backed down.

If that's the case I sincerely hope that President Trump will take advantage of it and get us out. We should've been out of Iraq and Syria a long time ago as the president pointed out, as you have reiterated. We gain nothing by staying in the country whatsoever. If these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the Iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. But if we are going to fight the Iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. As for the active killing Soleimani, I think we can say with some certainty that Iran will respond. Probably not in the way that we would. The Iranians are not like us. They do not emote. You've been listening to people emote about how much they hate Soleimani and blame the failure in Iraq on Soleimani. That's nonsense. We failed in Iraq. The generals and the politicians are responsible for the loss of American life and the squandering of our opportunities in Iraq. Soleimani simply took advantage of it and Iran now controls Iraq.

INGRAHAM: Remember, when Bill Marr got into all that trouble for saying the9/11 attackers were a reference and as courageous. What are these guys doing? Whereas Bush was too idealistic about what was possible in Iraq and whereas Obama was too defeatist about Iran, Trump's a realist, he's a pragmatist.
Chris Van Hollen: When she feels it's appropriate, and I think that, you know, that will happen. But the issue, Chris, is that we have a constitutional duty in the Senate to have a trial, and it needs to be a fair trial, and every American recognizes that a fair trial means you get to call witnesses, you get to have relevant documents. We've seen in the last two weeks more emails that have surfaced that show this Trump administration trying to cover up key emails showing that the president of the United States -- confirming again, he ordered the hold on vital U.S. Ukrainian military assistance. And so, why not get those documents? President Trump himself said that he wants Mulvaney to testify. He said that months ago. Why shouldn't we have witnesses? That is the question.
I understand the issue with President Trump and he certainly has reversed course a few times. What I'm asking you now, and this is -- we are in week four of the shutdown, so the situation has become dire.
In Louisiana, state Rep. Stephanie Hilferty, a Republican, sponsored a 2018 resolution that created a task force to study the logistics of a state terrorist registry. The task force is expected to have recommendations by February to craft legislation.

Each game begins with 100 combatants. The first time Brett played, there were about 80 other combatants remaining when he was killed. After he put in another 20 hours at the game, he was killed with just 10 people remaining. After another 100 hours at the game, six weeks later, Brett achieved his first victory. He was the last man standing. There is nothing like getting that first W [win]. It's the greatest feeling in the world, Brett told me.

Dulce Canal, spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Cuban Observers of Human Rights, told Fox News: The survey results reflect the rejection of the Cuban regime and its policies and practices. There is a collective weariness that has festered over time after so much frustration and oppression. The reaction among these Cuban Americans is a natural one toward the Cuban regime's intolerance and inflexibility.
And by the way, I don't recall Pelosi getting all flabbergasted when Obama would not give lethal aid to Ukraine. And you don't hear talk about that at all. Suddenly, it's her number one issue. So, impeachment ploy didn't work, so they just go back to the old Russian narrative that failed on Mueller and it's failing now.

Ryals, who said that law enforcement strives to be right 100 percent of the time, said the department was saddened by the disheartening event.
INGRAHAM: So, the senators are participating in a cover-up or the White House. I'm trying to keep it all straight. Our next guest actually spoke to John Bolton about the Ukraine mess last August, I shouldn't think the Left should be celebrating.
Michael Anton: Well, as you said earlier, the president really would like to get as much out of the Middle East as possible. But he didn't run as an isolationist. It's important to remember: he ran as kind of a Jacksonian. His philosophy of foreign policy is very simple. Live and let live. We will live and let live as much as possible. But if you hit us, if you mess with us, if you strike us, if you kill our people, we will hit back very, very hard. That's why, what he -- what he's doing is essentially retaliatory. It's not long-term nation building. He has no interest in staying in the Middle East, or rebuilding it, or transforming it for the long term.

The unique assignment is dictated by the Constitution. With Roberts at the helm, it would mark one of the few times the highest levels of the three branches collide in a political fight – one that may last only weeks, but whose effects can ripple for decades.
We succeeded together and making it stronger than ever before, making our nations more secure, more peaceful and more prosperous, he said.

Let me tell you something: the way Michael Bloomberg treated employees, female employees who were under his wing, who were relying on him for their -- for their livelihood, for their health benefits, for their 401(k)s, to have created that kind of culture, that unsafe workplace, to feel that you're being harassed because of your gender, that is problematic, and I think you're going to hear more of it.
Chris Wallace: But Washington called, President Obama appointing him ambassador to France. He brought Hollywood with him, hosting stars like Clint Eastwood, Jodie Foster, and Samuel L. Jackson, who met with young immigrants there.
Both Georgia runoffs are likely to be close as well, so there may not be a clear winner on election night.
INGRAHAM: What a week of shows. We had the breaking news on the missile strike on Tuesday. Then we had the secretary of state with us last night. And the president joining us for another exclusive tonight. And I'm telling you, the news shows no signs of slowing down next week because we expect the articles of impeachment to hit the Senate Tuesday or maybe Wednesday. And as always, we hope you join us right here for all of the breaking news, and the best analysis, and a little humor, you need that, too. So that's it from us tonight in Washington.

The poll, conducted by Florida International University, was evenly split between the 45 percent who said the U.S. should keep the embargo, the 44 who want it to end, and the 11 percent who said they were unsure.

Chris Wallace: He was one of the top generals and he was at one point leading our effort in Afghanistan.
Republicans have suggested that Schiff himself, and Hunter Biden, should testify, if Democrats insist on Bolton.
There was a motion to dismiss in the Clinton impeachment trial. It failed, because there were nearly a dozen felony offenses identified as abuse of power by the independent counsel Ken Starr. Here, there are no felony offenses. There are no high crimes and misdemeanors. They talked ad nauseum about extortion and bribery and in the end, they realized, there was no evidence for that. So, they conjured this wonderfully amorphous term, abuse of power. And you know I agree there ought to be and there probably will be a motion to dismiss and it should be seriously considered and voted upon.
WALLACE: I want to talk about how this race is beginning to shape up because after Tuesday it is beginning to shape up.
While we have made measured progress during the past several years under Tom Herman's leadership, Chris has recommended to the university president, Jay Hartzell, that UT make a coaching change to get us on track to achieving our ambitious goals, Texas said in a statement.

Disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now.
CAVUTO: He's been very prescient on a couple of key developments here very, very early on.
Some observers say North Korea is frustrated because the South has failed to break away from Washington and revive stalled joint economic projects held back by the U.S.-led sanctions. They also speculate that North Korea initially thought South Korea would help it win sanctions relief but got upset after Kim returned home empty-handed from the 2019 summit with Trump.
At the event at the Petersborough Town Library, Kerry told a crowd of about 100 voters: What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tx., told FoxNews.com: The Ayatollahs persecute Christians, and anyone else who refuses to accept their theocratic vision, because they fear freedom of conscience. Iran's repeated and worsening persecution of Christians is unacceptable and must stop. It is imperative that we support religious liberty around the world, and work to end the persecution of Christians and people of all faiths.

Looks like President Trump got ahold of Cuomo's Twitter account! Trump campaign social media director Mike Hahn tweeted.
The incumbent's current condition – fighting with his own party over foreign policy, presiding over a government shutdown and still smarting from the spanking he took in 2018 – leads Democrats to think that almost anybody would have a chance in 2020.
Chris Wallace: Mo, what about the argument that, as I've recited in the interviews with the two previous guests, that there are a number of actions that Iran has taken this year going after ships, shooting down a drone, attacking Saudi oil facilities; just in the last week they killed an American contractor, hurt -- badly injured a number of American soldiers, and then stormed the U.S. embassy. What about the argument that President Trump needed to stand up to this Iranian aggression and show resolve?

Johnny, thanks so much for coming on. You have a very personal connection to this story of course. We just explained it. So, I'm interested in your reaction to what happened yesterday.
Despite earlier claims this year by the Afghan Taliban that talks for a peace deal to end the protracted conflict were on track, the militant group abruptly canceled a scheduled meeting with U.S. officials in Qatar this week over an apparent agenda disagreement.

As the youngest person on Nixon's enemies list in 1972, I am particularly sensitive to a White House where they have utter disregard for trampling on dissent and on the rights of individuals.
President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met Monday for the first time since pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Pence oversaw an effort by congressional lawmakers to certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the Electoral College.
You know, this is -- the only good thing here is, is that after Obama campaigned with platitudes like that, he actually got into the White House and failed. At this point, we can have the guy fail before he gets real power.
This election isn't about any of us candidates. It is about voters' lives. And we're the ones trying to get voters a raise. We're the ones trying to make sure that there is paid family leave, working to end endless war, serious about climate change --
And especially after writing the anti-Trump op-ed. Republicans could change their minds, but at the moment a startling 89 percent support the president, according to a Gallup Poll.
Roberts, under the Constitution, presides over the impeachment trial. But the precise contours of his authority are not clearly established, and remain up for debate; Democrats have even said they will attempt a long-shot motion to give Roberts the unprecedented power to approve or reject witnesses, for example.

SANDERS: Look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. But you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? He never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to Officer Singh of California's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. This shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.
The Trump administration's scare tactics destroy trust in law enforcement, he tweeted earlier this week. The day our police ask for immigration status is the day people stop reporting crimes & sharing information. It's the day we stop being the safest big city in America. We won't let that happen.

There was a very interesting moment on Friday because President Trump came out to the Rose Garden after his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on Democrats who want to impeach.

CAVUTO: Of course, that's former Governor Rod Blagojevich thanking President Trump for commuting his 14-year prison sentence. He had been in there eight years. So he missed eight years of seeing his daughters grow up.
Keep in mind that the Muslim Brotherhood extremists who briefly ran Egypt (and were in the process of running it into the ground) regularly issued religious decrees declaring it immoral for Muslims to even wish Christians a Merry Christmas.

Roberts would also be multi-tasking, conducting a trial at the same time maintaining his regular caseload. The court's counselor Jeffrey Minear would likely be by the chief's side the entire time, along with a rotating pair of law clerks.
Loeffler and Perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge President-elect Biden's victory. They agree with anything Trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. They act as if they are running to be selected by Trump to be his employees on The Apprentice, rather than to represent the people of Georgia in the Senate.
Well, I want to throw out a name. And let's see if I'm right. Let's just see.
ELLEITHEE: And I do think it is premature. I think most members of House Democratic leadership agree with that. Most members of House Democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way Tom Steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. There may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and Bob Mueller will let everyone know when that time is.
The employer did not have the required workers' compensation coverage from March 31, 2018, to April 30, 2018, and was issued a final penalty of $1,500, which was paid, state Workers Compensation Board spokeswoman Melissa Stewart told the New York Daily News.
THE LEAD STORY – NEW CONGRESS, SAME SHUTDOWN POLITICS - Democrats will take control of the House Thursday as the new Congress convenes and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is set to once again become House Speaker, says they are refusing to give in on President Trump's demand for funding on a border wall ... Nothing for the wall, Pelosi said in an interview with NBC's Today show set to air Thursday. We can go through the back and forth. No. How many more times can we say no? Pelosi said Democrats will quickly pass legislation to re-open the government — which has been partially shut down since Dec. 22 — without funds for the border wall.

The intent here is to get Pelosi on defense and cast her as unwilling to deal with a huge issue of major importance to most Americans. It's not a format that suits the president, who struggles with scripted speeches, but if he can pull it off, could dramatically alter the political moment.

They need to find heart, because they've lost it complete. If they have a case, then make their case. If not, shut up.
The $214 million the GAO says was illegally withheld was allocated to the Department of Defense, while the rest was allocated to the State Department. The legal opinion said the GAO also had questions about the money from State, and that it was looking into whether that, withholding was proper.

Roberts has mostly stayed out of the spotlight in the trial. In the first day of the proceedings, Roberts admonished both sides for misconduct in the chamber, saying their rhetoric had gotten too heated. That warning reportedly came after a stunned Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins passed a note to Roberts, following Democrats' claims that a vote against their witness resolution would amount to a coverup.

HANNITY: I got to applaud you. Good for you. Good for you. Good for Ted Cruz. This is important, because you have Joe Biden -- you are not getting the billion taxpayer dollars.
But then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. And Nancy Pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides Republicans, that peels off Republicans. And the one thing that will keep Republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the Mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. If it just becomes -- if the Democratic Party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the Republican Party, which I think is a real concern, of just the anti-Trump party, than that will unify the Republicans.
Democrats accuse the President of acting precipitously though and destabilizing the region, which isn't surprising. If Trump says the sky is up, they're going to say, it's down. But think about this for a moment.
CAIN: The answer is, they don't want to put up with the ostracism -- being ostracized by people who think that all blacks should vote Democrat.

It is unconstitutional for a statute to take away the president's sole authority over foreign policy. The only limitation on the president's authority is he can't declare war. Other than that, he can decide the Jerusalem embassy for Israel without congressional authorization. He can decide who not to give money to.

TRUMP: Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office. I would love everybody to testify. I like Mick to testify. I like Mike Pompeo to testify. I like Rick Perry to testify. I want everybody, but there are things you can't do from the standpoint of Executive Privilege. You have to maintain that. So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic.
WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the new tension between President Trump and his attorney general.
That's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates and
President Trump has stated tonight, and, over and over again in recent weeks, that this country faces a national emergency, said Sanders, who is said to be considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Well, he's right. But it's an emergency and a crisis that he himself has created.
As you know, the expectations are that 50 to 70 percent of Iran's oil
Douglas Macgregor: Look. He walked into a room at Mar-a-Lago with Senators Rubio and Graham, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor O'Brien, the Secretary of Defense Esper, and I assume Jared Kushner. You're talking about a room full of neo-cons. You're talking about the people that you've been discussing that have been urging war with Iran forever. They seem to have persuaded him that this airstrike made sense and that we should take the opportunity and do it. And publicly he's said that. I think it was probably unnecessary for the reasons that I've already outlined. This is not going to do anything for us strategically. As far as sending the message is concerned, his deputy has already taken over. The deputy has been with him since '97. This is going to stiffen resolve against us, and it's going to make any attempt to reach any arrangement with Iran virtually impossible. So, from that standpoint, I don't think it made a lot of sense. It's not necessarily helping us and what the president says he wants to achieve in the Persian Gulf with Iran.
HERMAN CAIN, FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Leo is dead wrong and allow me to give you some statistical facts. First of all, two independent polls that I trust and most people trust, Rasmussen and Emerson show that 34 percent of black people support President Trump. Secondly, I travel all the time and I have people whispered in my ear, I love the Trump results. I love the Trump results. I go to a very large black church. Thirdly, look at what this President and his administration have done to directly impact black people. Criminal justice reform. Opportunity zones which impact more directly black communities and this is the only President including the last administration to basically authorize $400 million for historically black colleges and universities because they are struggling. Those are the absolute facts.

For about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class. Eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging.

Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth. There is no evidence that Iran started behaving any better after the deal and in no serious Republican or Democrat is even attempting at this point to argue that. Iran never released Bob Levinson, a former CIA officer, whom they've held for 13 years, ditto for at least five other American who've been held prisoner on absurd spurious grounds.

When I look back on our own family experience it comes down to this: The dangerous people (those who were recovering from COVID-19) were forced into nursing homes, putting others in extreme danger.

I personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral.

During that period of time, our GDP has suffered, probably on average 2 percent less than it would have been, we have not had the formation of 20 million jobs that would have happened. The massive trade cheating has to stop.

If they wanted the government reopened the Dems could negotiate with the president and reopen it tomorrow. He's already compromised on the structure of the wall and dropped his asking price. And while the Democrats feign concern over spending a few billion on a border wall - $5.7 billion - the Coastal Wonder Twins of their party, Gov.

They have no problem finding pots of money to spend on the well-being and health of illegal aliens.

One of the challenges of negotiating with President Trump, as Lindsey Graham knows better than anyone else, is I feel like I've signed up for the Trump of the day club.

Essential government workers, like TSA agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said.

The president went on to say he had predicted his words would be censored. Conservatives have long been complaining that social media sites like Twitter are biased against them in favor of liberals.
But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men.
And I think to say that you're going to continue this for years over an argument, an immigration argument that is actually not proven to be effective, that is sort of in -- where there has bene a wall, we have seen breaches time and time again, almost 10,000 breaches among certain sectors of the wall that exist now. Rather than taking that money and investing in actual technologies that would provide real border security, investigating in more Border Patrol agents, that, to me, seems like a better way to go.
By way of example, as a commander in operational combat zones in Kosovo and Afghanistan, I had thousands of troops and the latest technology arrayed along the borders with Macedonia and Pakistan, respectively.

In early December, Trump said illegal immigration cost $250 billion per year. On Dec. 18, he said it was more than $250 billion per year. That number jumped dramatically two days later when he claimed, illegal immigration cost our nation $275 billion a year.
Marie, how do you answer them?

It seems increasingly likely the United States is prepared to officially recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel. Acknowledging Israeli sovereignty over the strategically-critical heights would obviously be in Israel's interest, but also in the interest of the United States, explained Jonathan Ruhe, Associate Director, JINSA's Gemunder Center for Defense and Strategy. It would underscore U.S. support for Israel's self-defense, in particular against Iran and its proxies in neighboring Syria – an issue that's increasingly important as the United States reduces its own presence in that country and relies increasingly on its Middle East allies to push back against Tehran.
Tamasi also spotlighted the erosion of Trump's support within the party.
However, over five years after the deal was agreed to by President Barack Obama's administration, it seems history may be doomed to repeat itself as Joe Biden, House Democrats and others are trying to get the United States to reenter the agreement with Iran without first securing any new restrictions, conditions or other updates.
Trump did not lay out a specific timetable for when he might take such a step, saying: I think we're going to see what happens over the next few days.
The Trump Administration isn't trying to politicize these institutions, Pompeo said. We're trying to de-politicize them.
We think Democrats generally are underestimating the potential for Trump's re-election. But there's no denying that the party's nomination is viewed as a prize of great value.
The unprecedented attack on the Capitol, which was seemingly encouraged by Trump, comes as the soon-to-be former president has vowed to remain influential in GOP party politics after he leaves the White House and as he's pledged to support primary challenges in the 2022 midterm elections to Republican governors and senators who refused to aid his efforts to stay in power.

Common Cause, the watchdog group that supports limits on partisan line-drawing, is leading the challenge to the North Carolina districts. Whether it is Democrats or Republicans manipulating the election maps, gerrymanders cheat voters out of true representation, Common Cause president Karen Hobert Flynn said in a statement.

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's pretty clear right now, if you look at the polls this morning, that the president and Republicans are being blamed overwhelmingly for shutting down the government. And as Chris Coons pointed out to you this morning, Chris, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans had a unanimous support, Republicans and Democrats, for a bill that would have opened the government, kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward. It's the president who has made it a point to say, I'm shutting down this government over the wall.

Iran also attempted to acquire carbon fiber that it had agreed not to obtain and it stockpiled more heavy water than what was allowed under the JCPOA.
The brunt of that campaign came down on Lankford and the senator soon buckled. Five days after saying that the matter needed to be resolved immediately, Lankford said he was not in a hurry to get Biden briefed.
CARLSON: So I just wonder quickly, I mean, that kind of tells you a lot about how that community is viewed in the Democratic Party.

There's a wall in Iran, as soon as the news broke, it's a hashtag, which in English translates to Trump, you're the man. So thank you, President Trump, for having moral courage to make such a hard decision.
If we have to repeat this misery in 2024, can we count on so many lawmakers, officials and judges to stand up to the threats of a sore loser of their own party?

You know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.

The Travel Ban has been very successful in protecting our Country and raising the security baseline around the world, Gidley said.

These are just a few examples of many that show a clear trend: Speaker Pelosi is more interested in maintaining her position atop the Washington, D.C. political class and satiating the radical desires of her followers than protecting our country's national security.
Michael Anton: Well, as you said earlier, the president really would like to get as much out of the Middle East as possible. But he didn't run as an isolationist. It's important to remember: he ran as kind of a Jacksonian. His philosophy of foreign policy is very simple. Live and let live. We will live and let live as much as possible. But if you hit us, if you mess with us, if you strike us, if you kill our people, we will hit back very, very hard. That's why, what he -- what he's doing is essentially retaliatory. It's not long-term nation building. He has no interest in staying in the Middle East, or rebuilding it, or transforming it for the long term.

JORDAN: Yes. And one of them even -- one of the FBI agents even said they didn't think he was lying at the time. But they later then said that he -- that he did. Yes, they tried to set him up. They did set him up. But this is not unusual, because -- well, it should be unusual, but the FBI did it another time as well. They did it on January 6 at Trump Tower, when it was president-elect Trump. They went up there and briefed president-elect Trump on the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false. They went and briefed the president on it, so they could go then leak it to the press, and the press could write about it. And they tried to set up the president-elect of the United States in the same manner. So this is how they operate. And they got caught. Think about what Mr. Horowitz told us last month, Maria. He told us that the FBI, when they went to get the Carter Page warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they lied to the court 17 times in the initial application and the three renewals; 17 times, they lied to the court. And now what's interesting, is Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two individuals who were in charge of that investigation, got in a little spat now with Rod Rosenstein, who was also involved.

For me, it's very, very insulting and very sad that we are in a country, we left countries where we were running from or escaping from communism and the oppression of human rights violations, to come here and now be in a country where the front-runner for the Democratic nominee is a known communist sympathizer, said Maria Fernandez Gomez, a voter with Cuban roots.

Nothing would be more foolish and dangerous than not strengthening our might tirelessly and having an easy-going attitude at a time when we clearly see the enemy's state-of-the-art weapons are being increased more than ever, Kim said.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. Look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. But the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to Washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.
SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Well, when you have nothing to do...
If you started at a big state like Texas or California or New York, it'd be all a TV paid advertising battle. Instead, there's a very real vetting of voters who take their responsibility seriously and, so, I'm frustrated right now that the [Democratic] operatives can't get their act together.

I said to Saudi Arabia, we have a very good relationship with Saudi Arabia, I said listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops. I'm going to send them to you. But you've got to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank. We are going to help them, but these rich countries have to pay for it. South Korea gave us $500 million. They never gave us - they gave us $500 million. I said you're going to help us along. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea protecting you from North Korea. You've got to pay. And they gave us $500 million. I mean you should have breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff. I'm not sure anybody knows it. I might be sort of saying it, you have some - I mean its good stuff. But they are a wealthy country. They build all your television sets. They took that away from us. They build the ships. They build a lot of things. I said look, we're protecting you. You've got to pay. They paid us $500 million. They're going to pay us a lot more.

In just a few short days after taking back control of the House, some Democrats have already called for the impeachment of President Trump, the abolition of the Electoral College, restraints on presidential pardon power, and proposed a tax rate as high as 70 percent for the wealthiest taxpayers.

Curt Mills is a senior writer at the American Conservative. He joins us now. So Curt, this is unfolding, even as we speak. Where could it go from here?
Douglas Macgregor: Look. He walked into a room at Mar-a-Lago with Senators Rubio and Graham, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor O'Brien, the Secretary of Defense Esper, and I assume Jared Kushner. You're talking about a room full of neo-cons. You're talking about the people that you've been discussing that have been urging war with Iran forever. They seem to have persuaded him that this airstrike made sense and that we should take the opportunity and do it. And publicly he's said that. I think it was probably unnecessary for the reasons that I've already outlined. This is not going to do anything for us strategically. As far as sending the message is concerned, his deputy has already taken over. The deputy has been with him since '97. This is going to stiffen resolve against us, and it's going to make any attempt to reach any arrangement with Iran virtually impossible. So, from that standpoint, I don't think it made a lot of sense. It's not necessarily helping us and what the president says he wants to achieve in the Persian Gulf with Iran.

Dana Loesch: Well, and it's -- yeah. And it's anti-science. You know, when you talk about Castro and Beto O'Rourke and Michael Bloomberg and all of these other individuals that want to circumvent our Second Amendment rights, when they talk about criminal usage, we can't have a conversation about firearms unless we are also including, Tucker, defensive gun usages. These are individuals who are in lawful possession of their firearms. And these numbers – defensive gun usage is, according to the CDC from Barack Obama when he commissioned this in 2013. It has therefore, it's -- I mean, it's been affirmed many times over, as you know, that they vastly outweigh instances of criminal possession. So, why -- my actual fear is that people find this bad, that there are good people out there who take the time to educate themselves, to learn about their firearm and to train, as we saw all those congregants at the church do just a week or so ago with Jack Harris. And then Jack Harris probably trained some of them as well. Now, that's -- people should want to be able, they should be able to defend themselves. And we should encourage and empower people to do so instead of trying to shame them or smear them or malign their character. I find that disturbing.

Negotiations continued at the White House Friday. But apparently, they bore no fruit, because afterward, the president emerged to say the situation on our Southern border is so grave, he may be forced to build a wall without Congressional approval.

Trump, in a speech focused on what he described as a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border, appeared to reference parents such as Mazin and Golvach. Trump interacted with Angel parents frequently while he was campaigning for the White House, often invoking their departed sons and daughters during speeches and speaking about the parents on a first-name basis. His Tuesday remarks were delivered in a similar spirit.

Nor did the president clarify plans in Afghanistan, where he has ordered a troop reduction on an unspecified timetable.

We're going to go after Donald Trump. And that's exactly what they did. And never forget what Bill Barr said. Bill Barr said there was a crisis of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. That's the biggest understatement ever. Of course there was. Comey was fired. McCabe was fired, lied three times under oath. Jim Baker, chief counsel, had to resign. Lisa Page had to step down and resign as well, was kicked off the Mueller team, Peter Strzok kicked off the Mueller team and fired. So, those were the five key people who ran these investigations.

One U.S. attribute that distinguishes the current Middle East conflict from past ones is the country's energy independence. Last September, U.S. petroleum product exports exceeded imports for the first time in recorded history. The Energy Information Agency expects net exports of total crude oil and petroleum to average 570,000 barrels per day in 2020. Energy independence means that the U.S. has no vital economic interests in the Middle East -- a marked change from past conflicts where the country was dependent on a steady flow of Mideast oil to lubricate the domestic economy. This energy security gives the Trump administration more leeway in its foreign policy approach. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil, said President Trump in remarks to the nation on Wednesday.

Reporters lurk everywhere. In fact, there are many more reporters, photographers and technical personnel credentialed to cover Congress than lawmakers themselves.

Specialists who know granular details of transportation policy or military issues in Syria. There are reporters who just parachute in for big events like State of the Union or for President George H.W. Bush to lie in state.

They birthed a caliphate across Syria and Iraq and launched terror attacks that killed all across continents.

Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, the opinion said.

Even if the whole of Afghanistan doesn't need to be secured, it is still a bridge too far. According to the most recent Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) quarterly report, 11.6 million Afghans live in areas either under the control of, or contested by, insurgents. That would require 232,000 troops, which is more than double the peak U.S. troop deployment in Afghanistan of roughly 100,000 soldiers and some 15 times more than the current force in Afghanistan.

If Republicans win even one of the Georgia races, they'll hold a Senate majority for the next two years and have an effective veto over President-elect Joe Biden's agenda.

Truth be told, Loeffler and Perdue — not Warnock and Ossoff — are the radical candidates running in Georgia. The Republican candidates are out-of-touch with Georgia voters and values and reject their Senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Their only loyalty is to Donald Trump and to their own self-interest.

BENSON: No, he'll tweet. There's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less. I think that Mitch McConnell sat in the studio, the Senate majority leader, just a few days ago and urge the president to take the advice of his attorney general. I hope the president does it, even if he just calibrates it slightly differently.

The national sponsor, international sponsor of international terrorism, who the sponsoring force, pro-Hezbollah, Hamas and other radical groups. I just think that the the idea that this was not a threat, then that's who Soleimani was somehow an innocent and didn't deserve. What he got is just flies in the face of the reality that we all that we all understand and know. But we will be further briefings. I just wonder whether the facts will matter to our friends who've already made up their mind. Anything President Trump does, they're against reflexively.

The Travel Ban has been very successful in protecting our Country and raising the security baseline around the world, Gidley said. While there are no new announcements at this time, common-sense and national security both dictate that if a country wants to fully participate in U.S. immigration programs, they should also comply with all security and counter-terrorism measures -- because we do not want to import terrorism or any other national security threat into the United States.

Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that.

Facebook added: We're continuing to monitor the situation and will take additional measures if necessary to keep people safe.
JOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes. Obviously, he could. I mean he almost did. It's a sad day when the United States of America has to rely on the decision of a regime that we neither like nor trust to have them be the ones who behave somehow in a way that saves Donald Trump from his own decision.
JOHNSON: Bring your managers, if not the President's team will have his defense ready. And if you don't put out a case, we'll rule it to the President's defense. And by the way I think that's essential, I think the President needs a chance to defend himself.
WALLACE: Up next, how long will the shutdown drag on? We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the deadlock and when most Americans will start feeling the pain.

And Nancy's blatant political stunts will improve the lives of zero Americans. It will add zero jobs to the economy. It does nothing to make us more safe or secure, and we all know the outcome. It's going to die in the Senate.

The fake impeachment movement taking place is part of an ongoing effort to drive President Trump from office. It is part of a determination on the left that Trump must be expelled from the White House.

Good morning, Senator. Welcome to FOX News Sunday.
Enjoy a brief excerpt from a piece by the New Yorker's Jake Halpern about the skilled climber and thief referred to as Spider-Man by the French press. New Yorker: Long before the burglar Vjeran Tomic became the talk of Paris, he honed his skills in a graveyard. … At the age of ten, Tomic pulled off his first heist. He broke into a library in Mostar, climbing through a window that was nearly ten feet above street level. He stole two books, each of which appeared to be several hundred years old. … Tomic said of his early criminal adventures, 'It was intuitive. Nobody ever taught me anything.' … In time, Tomic began robbing apartments in more affluent neighborhoods. His climbing skills continued to improve, and by the age of sixteen he could scale the façade of a multistory building with relative ease. … One night, he had a vivid dream in which he stole five paintings from a museum. He took it as a portent. As he wrote to me, 'I knew that someday I would do something great.'

California's authority to set its own emissions standards tougher than the federal government's goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. The state has long pushed automakers to adopt more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less pollution. A dozen states and the District of Columbia also follow California's fuel economy standards.
Footage shared to Twitter on Tuesday also captured an argument on American's flight 1291 from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport to Dulles International Airport.

These two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President's statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks, the company said.

The point about these debates on free speech and political retaliation is that things look very different when the target is people on your side. I fully believe in accountability for those associated with last week's appalling attack on American democracy. But there's the potential for an awful lot of collateral damage here.

REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We are not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? The wall, in my view, is an immorality.

Tucker Carlson: Thank you. For more than 100 years the Boeing company has led international aviation. To this day it's measured by dollar amounts. Boeing remains America's single largest foreign exporter. But now like so many American institutions, Boeing is in trouble. Last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. There's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. Production is being suspended. In business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. How did it happen? Well, at least part of the responsibility lies with CEO Dennis Muilenburg who has been in charge at Boeing since 2015. Fittingly, Muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. Someone in corporate America is finally being held accountable for screwing up. But before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. According to recent SEC filings, Muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. That's his punishment. And by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. Here's some context for how much money that is. A rank and file employee at Boeing might make $60,000 a year. That's a decent salary in many places. It would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced Dennis Muilenburg is getting in his severance package.

The president, though, claimed there would be very little difference in emissions between the federal and California's standard, but said cars will be far safer and much less expensive.

It's time to put woke-ism to sleep.

In December, President Trump said ISIS had been wiped out in Syria.
The president has shown a willingness to compromise. You heard it. In a funding request to the Senate Appropriations Committee this week,he asks for items important to Democrats, including, $800 million for humanitarian needs at the border, such as medical support and additional facilities to house migrants - which, frankly, a lot of Americans probably think would be better spent on inner-city youth and on our veterans.
JOHNSON: I'm not sure what else John would really add to this. I haven't spoken to him since - we really talking about Ukraine. We share the same position, but from my standpoint, President Trump has been unbelievably consistent in why he had reservations about Ukraine. And it starts as a candidate when he didn't think Europe was doing enough in their own defense. And then, throw that into that mix, the corruption of Ukraine.

Mike Pompeo: It's interesting. I haven't heard any of the congressional leaders who have seen the full set of intelligence make the comments that you just described. I think any reasonable person who saw the intelligence that the senior American leaders had in their possession would've come to the same conclusion that President Trump and our leadership team did about the fact that there would have been more risk to America, more risk through inaction than there was through the action that we took. I think it's very clear. I think it's very plain. We'll do everything we can to share this information with the American people, but I think the American people understand too, there's certain things you just can't -- you can't put out in public. You got to protect Americans who are out collecting the intelligence. The intelligence we will need in the days and weeks ahead to continue to defend and protect them.

Only former Senator Fred Thompson waited several months to get into the race and found himself unable to catch up to the other candidates.

Most Democrats today believe that we as Americans are safer with that murderous thug alive and boldly spreading his influence in the country where we lost thousands of our servicemen? Really?

If the United States does indeed build a wall along its southern border and then monitors it effectively, it may succeed in curbing illegal immigration, but it will not end it. Walls cannot prevent people from overstaying their visas or being smuggled in another way. And if history is any precedent, illegal immigrants may attempt to tunnel under the wall, go over it or breach it some other way.

That same year, Israel deployed the Harpy, an autonomous weapon that can stay airborne for nine hours to identify and pick off enemy targets from enormous distances.

Donna Edwards: Well, no. I mean, I think we should examine that where we are right now is precisely because Mitch McConnell openly said that he wasn't going to have a fair process. And I think it's legitimate for Speaker Pelosi to actually keep open this process as long as she needs to. I mean, she's going to turn over the articles of impeachment, but she does want assurances, given that McConnell came out straightforwardly and said he wasn't going to have a fair process and that he was coordinating with the president. And so, you know, and I think that she actually has created leverage, because, in fact, she opened up the space for Murkowski and Collins. And I'm waiting for this phase -- for Mitt Romney, who stands nothing to gain in this process by aligning himself with the administration, with the president -- to make sure that there is, indeed, a fair process.

'He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump).''

But they're not. And they're asking for more. As we've discussed and I think they know how this ends, because it's going to take 67 votes to convict and remove President Trump. And they're doing all of this less than a year, about 11 months until the next general election. I think it's it's really backfiring on them. They know it is.

But there is a more profound reason that Romney lost to Obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success.

In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function.

As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

In recent years, Beijing has asserted more control over the city, drawing criticism that Hong Kong's freedoms were under attack.

And I'm going to make a suggestion that Mitch McConnell must listen to and I mean must, I am going to tell you what that is. Just a few moments.

Yet along the way, well before bin Laden was killed, the mission morphed into propping up the fledgling Karzai government in Kabul. As such, the U.S. military effort was no longer about going after those who were responsible for 9/11, but became an exercise in democratic nation-building.
Matt Gaetz, I think this is important. The president said something. They never talked about aid in the call.

Facebook initially flagged Trump's post with a label saying: Joe Biden has been elected President with results that were certified by all 50 states. The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election. The company later removed the post altogether.
Later, when the president shared three messages from the official @POTUS handle, Twitter quickly took them down. He sent the same text out in a statement to White House reporters, criticizing Twitter as an opponent of free speech and teasing a potential new conservative social media platform in the future.
How on earth does Twitter justify banning Trump for incitement, but taking no action against the thousands of users who said Hang Mike Pence, allowing it to become a trending topic? Or allowing foreign autocrats to spew lies and threats?
The congress is the Workers Party's top decision-making body, and it is being held as Kim faces what appears to be the toughest moment of his nine-year rule due to the triple blow to his already-fragile economy — pandemic-related border closings that have sharply reduced the North's external trade, a spate of natural disasters last summer and U.S.-led sanctions.

It's perhaps no surprise that Scarborough is skeptical about the reality of the border crisis. After all, he probably never saw the firsthand accounts of Border Patrol agents that his network blacked out the previous week.
The vote came as Trump, who is slated to visit the southern border on Thursday with top administration officials, walked out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders Wednesday afternoon over the partial government shutdown after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi again rejected supporting new funding for a border wall, according to those in the meeting.
And we're back with our panel.
Twitter said posts that include false claims that suggest immunizations and vaccines are used to intentionally cause harm to or control populations, including statements about vaccines that invoke a deliberate conspiracy; false claims which have been widely debunked about the adverse impacts or effects of receiving vaccinations; or false claims that COVID-19 is not real or not serious, and therefore that vaccinations are unnecessary.
By Dec. 15, about five weeks after the presidential election and roughly five weeks before the presidential inauguration, Vanity Fair published an article by Emily Jane Fox headlined Democrats are Paving the Way to Impeach Donald Trump. The focus at that phase of the effort was the family business, the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. and possible personal financial improprieties (all of which disappeared within a few weeks and were replaced by Russian collusion as the focus of Democratic coup efforts).

Essential government workers, like TSA agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said.

Schiff made similar arguments back in May 2005, saying in an interview with CNN's Crossfire that Bolton was more focused on the next job than doing well at the last job when he was up for nomination as ambassador to the United Nations under then-President George W. Bush.

What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't even want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner-city dysfunction and it made sense: big government.

And by the way, remember, they used to say we pay for it. No, no. China devalued their currency and they pay for it. And we have a great relationship with China right now. So I don't want to speak badly of anyone, but they are having the worst year that they've had. The last year was the worst year they've had in 67, it was 57, now it's 67 years. And they wanted to make a deal, and we made a deal. And it's a great deal. Now we have a phase two deal which will start at some point, but phase one was very important for banking.

Now, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.

Fox News later identified clips of Schiff, D-Calif., now the lead House impeachment manager, in which he says Bolton had a distinct lack of credibility and was prone to conspiracy theories. This week, Schiff said Bolton needed to testify in the impeachment trial as an important and believable witness.
And secondly, you know they've got this false choice that they're throwing out there, either we do nothing and continue to appease the terrorists, or we have World War III with D-Day style invasions of Tehran. There is a lot of room in between. There is a lot of options. That is not on the table and nor does the President need authorization to defend our embassies, to defend our troops to strike back and to stop this escalation. He's absolutely right. We're preventing further war. We're not escalating into war. We're stopping Iran's escalation. And I think it was absolutely the right move.
Canady, who recorded the shooting, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette he rescued Reese's after moving to the Shiloh Estates area three years ago.

By the day of the inauguration, January 20, 2017, the impeachment hunger was great enough that the Washington Post headlined Matea Gold's article The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.
Costa Mesa is in Orange County and is home to about 100,000 people. It's also home to the Fairview Developmental Center, a state-owned facility, that one housed about 3,000 adults with developmental disabilities.
The incident took place between a highway and the border fence. The area is flat near the highway, then slopes sharply downward closer to the fence, where most of the migrants were clustered.
A hundred years from now, if a president doesn't have the House in the same party, that president is going to be impeached. So, it's time to play hardball.
Iran's announcement coincides with the anniversary of the U.S. drone striking Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad last year. That attack later saw Iran retaliate by launching a ballistic missile strike injuring dozens of U.S. troops in Iraq. Tehran also accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet that night, killing all 176 people on board.
An October 2000 memo stated that the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.
It was a very public reminder of the challenges that Shanahan, as acting defense secretary, faces as he navigates the complex terrain that led to the early end of his predecessor's tenure.
The sweeping proposal appeared destined to push California -- already one of the nation's most liberal states -- even further to the left, as progressive Democrats there won a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature in November and control all statewide offices.

Aside from those who depend on food assistance, the partial government shutdown has also hindered advocacy groups combating domestic and sexual violence. Many organizations nationwide that provide services such as shelter or counseling need to access grant money authorized through the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which was not extended when the government partially shuttered on Dec. 22 absent a funding deal.

Schumer blasted Trump's picks, telling The Associated Press that they are are just so bad for the average American in so many ways, due to their hard right stance. McConnell, however, said that judges who follow a strict interpretation of the law instead of taking an activist approach are good for everyone.
The president posted a taped video on Wednesday afternoon as violent protests erupted on Capitol Hill during a joint session of Congress to certify the results of the presidential election.
CRUZ: ... the outcome of this is going to be, the president will be acquitted. The Senate will vote not guilty. And the reason I can say that with confidence is because, on their face, the articles of impeachment, they don't allege high crimes and misdemeanors. They fail on their face. And so I hope we get 51 votes in a week-and-a-half to say, this is over. If not, if not, if there are at least four Republicans who joined the Democrats for witnesses, then we're looking at a trial that will probably last six, eight weeks or longer...
A California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman told The Associated Press that McAlister has been incarcerated in state prisons numerous times. In April 2020, he was sentenced in San Francisco County to five years for second-degree robbery and was released on parole for time served.
Well clearly, there were mistakes made based on the inspector general's reports, Brennan responded. And I know that a lot of people attribute it to either to incompetence or politicization. Well, I might just attribute it to, these were FBI agents who were doing their level best to try to prevent Russia interference in the election.
If we uphold a particular political decision, that remains the decision of the political branches, and the fact that it may lead to criticism of us is often a mistake, he said in 2016. We do have to be above or apart from the criticism because we, of course, make unpopular decisions -- very unpopular decisions.
Or, as Trump might characterize it, swipe them back.

The Obama administration largely watched from the sidelines as the Venezuelan regime ran the country into the ground. It stood silent as then-Vice President Tareck Zaidan El Aissami, an alleged drug-trafficking kingpin, worked hand in glove with Los Zetas and other regional drug cartels. It was not until Trump came into office that the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on El Aissami.

But regardless of how much progress these proposals might make on the House floor, they're already part of the 2020 conversation. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who has been tipped for a White House bid, said last month that he is excited to support the Green New Deal.
PRIEBUS: Yes, no doubt about it. And guess what, sometimes the best defense is the so what defense, which is if everything the Democrats said is true, it's still not impeachable, if everything Lev Parnas has said is true, it's still not impeachable. I mean, that's what this is about.
Chris Wallace: The Senate returned, Friday, to its continuing stand-off over how and when to hold a trial after the impeachment of President Trump. And now, that's further complicated by the explosive developments with Iran. Joining us now here in Washington, Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Senator, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.
HOLMES: Yes, I think it's obvious, right? I mean if you're talking about a $4 billion discrepancy, there's got to be a way to get -- come to the middle of it. Certainly if you were in the Democratic Party right now, there are concessions that you're interested in accomplishing, right? And if that is the case, you ought to wonder down to the speaker's office and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office and give them a piece of your mind.

She wanted me to stay. The press had no, no, he was supposed to be there, it's very rude. We had a great time. Then we had dinner. We were honored. Our country was honored.

The Iranian regime has long persecuted Christians, Baha'is and other religious minorities. The recent uptick in repression, specifically targeting Christians and Christian converts, is alarming and unacceptable, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has spoken up for persecuted Christians, told Fox News. The U.S. must continue to raise the cases of individual political prisoners and pressure the Iranian regime to end its gross human rights and religious freedom violations.
WHITAKER: This is the first time that a President's been impeached where there's underlying crime and on a purely partisan vote. So we don't have any elements of those crimes with which we can compare the facts that were you know, sort of developed in the House and this is why this is a very troubling time in American history, if you take a step back and understand, we've entered a new era of partisan impeachments which is not good for our Republic. And so I hope that the senators understand that and that they cannot turn this into a very partisan circus which is what we saw in the House.
This will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety advantage, and also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars, Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.
Due to Romney's failure to defeat Mr. Obama, Ric had to wait four more years before the nation had a candidate and then president with the character to not just recognize Ric's talent but stand by him.

KELLY JANE TORRANCE, NEW YORK POST: I think it's very interesting that people have been talking for years about how there's this battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party with Donald Trump and what happened.
JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and I hope it's sooner rather than later. But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.

Your border security presentation submitted to Congress today is yet another example of the misinformation and outright lies the Trump Administration has used to make the case for the President's boondoggle border wall, defend the government shutdown, and distract the American people from a border policy so flawed that children have died in Department of Homeland Security custody, Thompson wrote.

And after this airstrike and killing of Soleimani, we've actually forced them together because the people of Iraq may not like the Iranians, but they don't necessarily want their country turned into a battleground between the United States and Iran.

CRUZ: I think it is certainly possible that this trial could last one to two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it six, eight weeks, or even longer. So I think there are really two paths here. But what you just noted there is important. This week is going to be the first time in a year that the president has had the opportunity to defend himself, to lay out the facts, to lay out the law, to lay out the actual substance. We have seen months and months and months of a one-sided show trial from House Democrats, where they didn't want to hear from the defense, where they shut out the White House, where they shut out the minority. The good news is, in the Senate, what I'm confident of is, we're going to have a fair trial. We're not going to give in to the kind of games that House Democrats have played. Instead, we're going to give both sides a full and fair opportunity to present their case. The House managers will have every opportunity to stand up and to present their arguments, to put forth whatever evidence they have. But for the first time, the president and the White House defense team is going to be able to walk through the facts and substance. And I think that's a very, very important development.

There have been many calls for an independent, bipartisan investigation into the nursing home tragedy, especially after an internal NYS Health Department study (conducted by Cuomo's own administration) dismissed the COVID-19 recovering patients as the reason for the thousands of deaths, and instead blamed staff members and visitors. The governor's investigation of himself was panned for its complete whitewash of his failed response.

We're going to go after Donald Trump. And that's exactly what they did. And never forget what Bill Barr said. Bill Barr said there was a crisis of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI. That's the biggest understatement ever. Of course there was. Comey was fired. McCabe was fired, lied three times under oath. Jim Baker, chief counsel, had to resign. Lisa Page had to step down and resign as well, was kicked off the Mueller team, Peter Strzok kicked off the Mueller team and fired. So, those were the five key people who ran these investigations.

By the way, the congressman was just completely wrong when he said I'm the only scholar who supports this position, Dershowitz said.

The economy is in crisis and collapse.

Two things about big congressional classes. They are so massive that inevitably some new Members will commit what are regarded as amateur mistakes. Some are just stumbles. Others are glaring errors.

TRUMP: So, when I came in as you know NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. If you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a rollercoaster down. Now, and Secretary Stoltenberg, I think he's terrific. In my first year, I raised $130 billion from them, not from us. And now he just announced $530 billion, all because of me. He's my biggest salesman. My greatest salesman Secretary Stoltenberg. But I said to him, look, you're there for Russia and Europe. OK. By the way, NATO is much more for Europe than it is for us and yet we--
El Aissami, who still serves as Maduro's Minister of Industries and National Production, is no outlier. The regime is shot through with corruption.

Dana Loesch: No, I agree with you, Tucker. And thanks for having me. I find it horrifying that anyone at USA Today would actually find it horrifying to save lives, to defend innocent people, because that's exactly what happened. I was also, and the reason to remind everyone that we have this video to go by, is because sadly, the church was live streaming their service that Sunday morning, as they always do, and it ultimately was captured. But you see in that video, Tucker, there are about five other law-abiding individuals who also draw their weapons, which is probably what would happen at my church. And I'm one of the law-abiding people who carry in my church, and we are encouraged to do so. But five other people also drew their lawfully carried, lawfully owned firearms, and they held. They watched and waited and took in everything that was happening before then, which indicates a level of training and a skillset that shouldn't horrify people. In fact, it should encourage individuals, because we were always told that if there is more than one firearm present in an area such as this, that there's a mass casualty incident or someone armed comes in to do murderous intent, that it would turn into the Wild West. Well, it didn't. It took Jack Harris one shot and six seconds to neutralize this threat. God bless them and God bless Texas.
The health of our crew members and passengers is a top priority for us and we refuse to compromise their health or safety in any way, Bassani said.

I mean he's the guy stands up at the United States Congress and repeats a conversation except it was a fraud. He made up a conversation. He was saying my conversation and it was totally wrong and he knew it. He said, don't call me, I'll call you. That's from the Godfather. That's a mafia statement. I never said that. He said eight times quid pro quo. It was no times. He made up a conversation and repeated it in front of Congress and because he has immunity, we can't do anything about it. I'd like to say, why did you do that? Now, these people are frauds and it's very bad. No, they've cheapened the word impeachment. It's a bad word to start off with. I really say, it's an ugly word. To me, it's a very ugly word, but maybe it played to our benefit.

Should she lose the vote on the deal next week, as expected, May will likely face fresh pressure to resign and possibly another vote of confidence -- this time in Parliament.

Now, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.
Even though the United States insisted there would be inspections anytime and anywhere of Iran's military sites, the Iranians made it clear before, during and after this agreement was entered into that such inspections would never be permitted. Additionally, the United States agreed to not have any American weapons inspectors participate in any JCPOA inspections.

These analyses, which have informed UK government planning in recent weeks, show that the new variant of concern, B.1.1.7, has substantially higher transmissibility than previous SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the U.K., said Ferguson in a statement. This will make control more difficult and further accentuates the urgency of rolling out vaccination as quickly as possible.
Then, in late August, I was invited with my husband and his sister Donna to join many lawmakers in Albany to push legislation to create an independent commission to investigate the nursing home deaths.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I I I wonder whether Senator Schumer thinks that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden I guess he is no longer in the Senate. Amy Klobuchar and other senators running for president are, strictly speaking, impartial writers. It's not a good it's not a good analogy. I know all of us, including myself, have used that as an analogy, but it's not the same thing as an impartial jury in a criminal or civil case that would be tried in a court of law. We know that the that this is primarily a political matter and one where the people who cast their vote, either in the House from the Senate will be held accountable by the people they represent. That's what this is. So I think it's it's hypocritical, particularly if looking back on the way that Senator Schumer and others conducted themselves in the Clinton impeachment, he actually ran for the Senate against Senator Al D'Amato, saying if elected, he would vote to acquit President Clinton. That's not exactly impartial.

They can argue law and argue whatever they want. After that, the president and the White House, they get 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. Then we shift questions from senators. Senators get 16 hours. Our questions have to be in writing, and the chief justice asks them for us. All of that, I would anticipate, takes about a week -- a week to a week-and-a-half. At that point, what the scheduling order provides is, the Senate is going to vote on whether or not additional witnesses are necessary. That's a 51- vote threshold. I don't know how that vote is going to come out. I think all 47 Democrats will vote yes. The open question is whether there will be four Republicans to join with those 47 Democrats. And, look, I think some of that depends on what happens in the first week- and-a-half, what arguments the House managers put forward, what arguments the White House puts forward, what questions comes out. I hope, at the end of the week-and-a-half, where Republican senators are is -- is, we have heard enough. The evidence they have put forward doesn't satisfy the constitutional standards. The Constitution says, impeachment lies for high crimes and misdemeanors.

House Democrats say that returning both Iran and the United States to compliance with the JCPOA must be the starting point for further negotiations. But that's not an option.

But investigations to come fast and furious - Politico: Democrats want to investigate the Trump Hotel deal and President Donald Trump's taxes. They want to haul up conflicted Cabinet officials and dig into controversial changes to the census and food stamps. They want to put Education Secretary Betsy DeVos under oath and investigate child detentions at the border. The threat of subpoenas, investigations and oversight hearings will dominate the new House Democratic majority agenda, targeting the White House's most controversial policies and personnel, spanning immigration, the environment, trade and of course, the biggest question of them all: Russian collusion. … But for House Democrats in control for the first time in nearly a decade, it's also a role full of pitfalls. Trump has already tried to brand the prospect of congressional oversight as nothing more than 'harassment,' and Democrats will also have to show they can legislate, govern and investigate all at the same time in the House.

China perceived the lack of strategic focus of the George W. Bush administration and the passive lead from behind foreign policy of the Obama administration as American decay and decline. In reality, the foundational aspects of the American economy remain surprisingly strong and the American fighting spirit is not dead -- merely sleeping. Those who would believe that the sinking of two aircraft carriers would trigger an impulse toward retreat would do well to make themselves aware of the United States' history and the impact events such as the sinking of the Lusitania, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the collapse of the World Trade Center had on the national psyche. What some have labeled the Jacksonian impulse could be described as a tendency toward great power rage. To be sure, it burns itself out. After all, the U.S. is considering leaving Afghanistan, 17 years later.

It could be, Republicans have asserted, that the whistleblower coordinated his complaint with Schiff's panel for partisan reasons -- a disclosure that, if true, would likely undermine the credibility of the impeachment proceedings and possibly expose Schiff to his own abuse of power allegations.

In fact, we beg him not to.' The editorial listed several points, including the sexual harassment allegations, while noting they are not directed at him personally.

If these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the Iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. But if we are going to fight the Iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. As for the active killing Soleimani, I think we can say with some certainty that Iran will respond. Probably not in the way that we would. The Iranians are not like us. They do not emote. You've been listening to people emote about how much they hate Soleimani and blame the failure in Iraq on Soleimani. That's nonsense. We failed in Iraq.

You've got to be strong enough to push back. And that happens when you have people that you can link arms with and say, no, we're not going to do it that way, and I think we have that.

Consider the oath of office that we take for granted. Whenever we bestow upon anyone the authority to wield the power of the state over free citizens, we make them swear to protect not the people, not the nation, not the flag, but the Constitution of the United States. A piece of paper. – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) in a column from the Washington Post on Nov. 29, 2018, excerpted from his posthumous book, The Point of It All.
Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the story was more evidence that FBI leaders actually had no real evidence against the Trump team.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you suggesting that if the president did not abide by a resolution if it were to be passed by the House, by Congress, that you would potentially add that to articles of impeachment against him?
Even former Secretary of State John Kerry admitted he hadn't read the verification regime detailed in those secret side deals. President Obama said that the Iran nuclear agreement was not based on trust, but verification, but how can U.S. officials sign off on a verification regime they have never read?
He repeated calls for federal aid to state and local governments, a plea that is likely to fall on more sympathetic ears after Democrats take control of Congress and the White House.
Facebook initially flagged Trump's post with a label saying: Joe Biden has been elected President with results that were certified by all 50 states. The US has laws, procedures, and established institutions to ensure the peaceful transfer of power after an election. The company later removed the post altogether.
What's he done for me? Trump asked. How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good.
President Trump is right when he argues that drones and technology are not sufficient to stop illegal immigration. Of course, our border patrol forces armed with technology and drones are a lethal force but that combination alone cannot totally prevent illegal immigrants or hostile forces from entering the United States.
Last year, Ocasio-Cortez was also mocked after lamenting the shuttering of a coffee shop in New York, even though it closed its doors thanks to the wage hike in the state – a policy that she supports.
The number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.
A hybrid between a courtroom trial and a legislative debate, Senate impeachment trials mix ceremony and substance.
The list of people and things Cuomo has blamed for his error is quite lengthy. They include God, Mother Nature, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, President Trump, the New York Post, Fox News, nursing home workers, and nursing home visitors.
Kim's comments made this week during a key meeting of the ruling party were seen as applying pressure on the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who has called Kim a thug and has criticized his summits with President Donald Trump.
J.D. Vance: Well, I think for a couple of reasons. One, we have an entire generation of American intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the Middle East was just the most important region of the world. And so, one way of thinking about American policy really for the past 20 years, the George W. Bush administration, of course the Barack Obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. We basically had one new war per term, Iraq, and then -- excuse me, Afghanistan, then Iraq, Lebanon and Syria during the Obama terms and that's obviously terrible and I think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for America's national interest but viewed from the Chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. Of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for America's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that China was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. I think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the American foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.
First, if we set red lines for talks, either stand by them or don't set those red lines at all.

We are accustomed to large quantities of drugs passing through our jurisdiction by way of the interstate, Sheriff Carlton Speed said in a statement to Fox 5 Atlanta. However, this is a unique case because the Cartel essentially set up shop in Banks County.
Another law, 10 U.S. Code § 2808 - Construction authority in the event of a declaration of war or national emergency, permits the secretary of defense, in a presidentially declared emergency, to use funds that have been appropriated for military construction for the purpose of undertaking military construction projects.
I've been clear that oversight will be a priority of mine as Chairman, and part of that is reestablishing an Foreign Affairs Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which existed for much of the last 20 years. Of course the Committee will still deal with the threat of terrorism. In fact, we're expanding the jurisdiction of our subcommittees for different parts of the world to include terrorism so they're better able to grapple with this problem with a regional focus, Engel said.
Our policy did allow our attorneys to participate in observing election recounts and similar actions on a voluntary basis in their individual capacity as private citizens so long as they did not act as legal advisers, the firm said in a statement Monday.

Kim's latest nuclear threats were likely meant to pressure President-elect Joe Biden to resume diplomacy and make concessions after he takes office next week. But some experts say Biden, who has criticized Kim's made-for-camera summits with President Donald Trump, won't do so. They say Kim's new economic plan lacks substance, and that much of North Korea's chronic economic difficulties are a result of its decades-long mismanagement, self-imposed isolation and U.S.-led sanctions imposed because of his nuclear program.

However, many soldiers and families connected to Fort Hood told Fox News that the personnel changes were merely cosmetic, and they feared business as usual when the spotlight faded.
But I'm just saying, of course, I think if you listen to Joe Biden, over hundreds of hours during this campaign answer questions about all the issues that he had to deal with in the White House, yes, I absolutely think he is quite capable.
Most who come to Washington contend they won't go native and will fight against the unholy monikers listed above. There's merit in that. But consider this quotation from Katharine Graham, the longtime publisher of the Washington Post: When it comes to Washington, most people tend to think first of politics. But Washington is also a geographic and physical place. It is, for instance, one of the few cities in the world where you can talk endlessly about trees.
The spokesperson also emphasized that the challenges at Fort Hood forced us to take a critical look at our systems, our policies, and ourselves.

Let's have a discussion; let's get to a place where we agree.
We just thought, if we're going to do something relevant in this era where Congress is going to reassert itself, where there are so many questionable activities of this Administration vis-à-vis foreign policy, that it made sense to have this, Engel told The New Yorker in a sit-down interview this week.
In his speech at Riverside Church just before Thanksgiving, the governor said to always remember this advice when it comes to leadership:

He has a history of being a very impartial, fair, almost umpire-like justice, who calls them as he sees them, said Schaffer. I don't think he'll treat this trial any differently.
The economy is in crisis and collapse. The GDP for the first quarter was NEGATIVE 2.9%, one of the worst showings in history, six years after Obama's trillion dollar stimulus promised to save the economy. That stimulus went to Obama's voters (the poor) and Obama's donors (the super rich). But the bill (in the form of debt) goes to the middle class for decades to come.
The same commitment to the teachings of Christ found in Scripture informs my sentiments today about what we witnessed at the Capitol on Wednesday.

Tucker Carlson: They're thinking, let's get some. That's what they're trained to do. That's their job. Their job is to be there, be ready and to not question so much why as to how and when. That's their job. But when they go, and they experience war like I've done twice and they come back and maybe they have an injury, maybe they lost buddies. They get 10 years older, 10 years wiser. They pay attention a little bit more to politics. And they say, Why was out there? What was I accomplishing, and what was I told? And how much of it was true? I think President Trump at this very moment is as inclined for military as he is diplomacy. And he's thrown the ball in the court of Iran today with a tweet to say, Listen, you're not going to win a war, but you might win at the negotiating table, because I think that is his end goal. And he may have made it through advisers or through his own wisdom to the point that he understands maybe that's all Iran will respond to. That's our hope. That's our hope today. Is that Iran responds to military force. We really don't have a playbook to see if they will, and it's quite a risk and a gamble. And it's ultimately the gamble of men and women just like myself.

During the shocking scene, Acosta refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide and there was brief contact between the two. His White House pass was revoked later that day but it was eventually restored when CNN argued that it violated the network and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights. The encounter with the aide didn't change his style, as Acosta has continued his aggressive behavior toward members of the Trump administration that is often seen as grandstanding.

Does good parenting mean letting kids decide? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. If your kid is invited to two different parties this Saturday, it's reasonable to let your kid decide which party to attend. But if your 12-year-old wants to drink a vodka tonic or two, just to see what it feels like, that's not such a great idea. Alcohol is toxic and can be addictive. The younger the child, the greater the risks. For 12-year-olds, the risks of drinking alcohol clearly outweigh the benefits.
The president will give a speech at the forum and meet with world leaders and business executives.
But it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face. I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.

SEN. MITT ROMNEY, R-UTAH: There's the - if you will, the Clinton impeachment model, which is to say that we have opening arguments and then we have a vote on whether or not to have witnesses. That's the approach I favorite. And at that point I'll be voting in favor of considering witnesses. Clearly John Bolton. Yes. I mean he's someone who I would like to hear from.
This is not an ordinary vote. Everybody in the country is watching. There was not one Republican that supported impeachment in the House. I don't think there will be in the Senate.
But not just securing the border, but fixing the immigration system as a whole; it's completely broken. The president wants to make sure we look at all of the different things, loopholes we can close, to make that better. Infrastructure, fighting the opioid crisis -- those are going to be things that also not only are the president's big priorities, but things we think we might be able to get Democrats to actually work with us.
What we now know is that the -- the FBI formalized what McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page and all others have been doing for a matter of months before that point of view.

This provided a perfect excuse for them to do so.

Josh Holmes: Well, first off, this whole thing is kind of confusing to me, as to why Nancy Pelosi believes that it increases her leverage, by holding the papers. I mean, every day that she holds them, they look more and more bizarre. And the closer and closer that they get to the Iowa caucuses -- which, of course, throws off the closing arguments for every 2020 Democrat running against President Trump, ultimately -- but secondly, she has no leverage here. This is not about trying to control the contours of the Senate. She's never going to be able to do that. So, this ends only one way; and that's when she sends the papers over without any kind of preconditions. That's basically what McConnell said this week.

Processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off, incoming domestic policy adviser Susan Rice told Spanish wire service EFE recently. Migrants and asylum seekers absolutely should not believe those in the region peddling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on Day 1. It will not.
Most who come to Washington contend they won't go native and will fight against the unholy monikers listed above. There's merit in that. But consider this quotation from Katharine Graham, the longtime publisher of the Washington Post: When it comes to Washington, most people tend to think first of politics. But Washington is also a geographic and physical place. It is, for instance, one of the few cities in the world where you can talk endlessly about trees.

But he knows that if he shows up he'll be targeted by all the other candidates who want to bring down the biggest player. And he will have to endure question after question from the Fox team and his opponents about creating a universal health care plan in Massachusetts that closely mirrors the president's controversial health care reform plan. So his strategy is to let the little guys fight it out before they get to challenge him.

I want to pat you on the back about your coverage of coronavirus and make a political point, which is not to be needlessly critical of Donald Trump, which is if you have an administration that treats science as a joke about climate change, when you take a Sharpie to a map, the whole public when your issue is science, it doesn't really have faith in you.

The resolution of the 1876 election was a disaster and the start of a dreadful period of American history. That Cruz would invoke it now as a model would be shabby enough even without his attack on one of the central pillars of federalism: state control of elections.

In his remarks, Pompeo said the VOA had lost its commitment to its founding mission under past administrations and shifted toward broadcasts that were too often about demeaning America. He also addressed criticism from VOA employees, arguing that those who sought to block his speech from being broadcast live had a dangerous instinct toward censorship.
First, tonight, more manufactured hysteria from the D.C. swamp. Let me be clear there is absolutely nothing significant nothing meaningful about this charade, this miscarriage of justice on Capitol Hill. You have conspiracy theorists, con artists and liars, same people that have been doing it for the last three years, they are now dragging this country through the mud and it's all out of pure rage, denial, hatred psychosis and insanity.

In an interview Wednesday night, Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders claimed he was too busy to know about the bombshell sexual misconduct allegations that internally rocked his 2016 presidential campaign, even as he apologized to any women who had not been treated appropriately.
CHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. And let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if Biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. And he, so far, has not delivered.

I think that Section 230 has needed to be changed for quite some time, I think it's not appropriate for the current state of the Internet. Back in the 1990s when it was put into place, it was written that way to enable innovation, which it did, Toscano said. I think we've just reached the point… no one is accountable and now it's time for us to change some of those rules in order to make sure people are held accountable.
Sharing two tweets from the president Friday, including one in which he said he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, the company argued that they had to be viewed in part of a greater context.

I think that's fueling the impeachment. But when I'm disappointed with, Sean, is that you failed to mention when you introduced me the fact that, you know, I have a robust life in terms of liking a drink now and then. I've been sober for a week, because I promised not to have a glass of alcohol until the president is acquitted, because I'm confident he will be.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is the Ingraham Angle tonight from Washington. And do we have a show for you tonight? My exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House. It's been a wild week all around in Washington. Of course, the rest of the world. The President passed a monumental leadership test this week with flying colors. First, we had an Iranian missile attack in retaliation for the killing of terrorist mastermind Soleimani. Democrats of course predicted World War III would ensue. And as usual, the President proved them wrong. So, now hostilities aren't a deescalated state and Iran may and I underline may even come to the negotiating table. No one thought that was going to happen. Second, the President and the GOP held firm on impeachment. And boy, did that strategy pay off. After weeks of delay, Nancy Pelosi is finally caving, and she will transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Her plot to control the Senate trial has been completely foiled. Oops. Well, I had the great privilege of sitting down with the President for a wide-ranging interview today. He made news on all of these important topics and a lot more and he shared his plans for the New Year. Here's part one of my exclusive interview with President Trump.

The president also said he has been telling these Republicans to get rid of Section 230.
But I'll tell you what my fear is, is that some Republicans are going to vote for witnesses, we'll get those, the ones the Democrats want and then when we have the votes on bringing witnesses or letting the president choose his witnesses, I think those will fail, not only because of those Republicans but because a whole variety of Republicans may not allow the whistleblower, may not allow Biden for one reason or another because they served with them.
INGRAHAM: And then women who seem to be, as you said earlier, seem to be really happy that Soleimani was taken out, we have a picture of that, as well.

After close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around them — specifically how they are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter — we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence, the company wrote in a blog post.
Although it is historically rare for freshmen members of Congress to obtain sought-after seats on top committees, progressive groups said they saw the news as a setback, as they hope to enact sweeping environmental and economic reforms in the coming years. The Steering and Policy Committee, chaired by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, formally assigns members to committees.
Such a sweeping policy would almost certainly be dead on arrival as long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress or the White House. Krugman noted the political realities for the left, arguing that Democrats can't enact such a plan this year but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years.

Police confirmed that U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick was among those who died of injuries sustained during the riots.

The deal, which is expected to be defeated in Parliament next week when it is voted on, has split May's Conservative Party and sparked numerous resignations -- with Brexiteers unhappy that it would keep the U.K. in a customs union until a trade deal is forged.

They don't have to be interested. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind.

What this chain of actions supports is that there is a deep state — a group of unelected officials who now wield power far beyond their constitutional authority – who believe, like Comey, that they know best. In this case it was aided by Obama administration holdovers who never accepted the outcome of the election and sought to prevent it and later reverse it.

Biden's attorneys did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment late Monday.

KERIK: You know what, Tucker? Nobody knows how to fix the city and how to reduce crime better than I did, and I do because I was there when the Renaissance occurred, but it looks like this Mayor and this Governor, they're trying to diminish and destroy all the programs that were put in place that reduced crime by 65 -- violent crime by 65 to 70 percent, homicide by 70 to 75 percent.

J.D. Vance: Well, I think for a couple of reasons. One, we have an entire generation of American intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the Middle East was just the most important region of the world. And so, one way of thinking about American policy really for the past 20 years, the George W. Bush administration, of course the Barack Obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. We basically had one new war per term, Iraq, and then -- excuse me, Afghanistan, then Iraq, Lebanon and Syria during the Obama terms and that's obviously terrible and I think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for America's national interest but viewed from the Chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. Of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for America's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that China was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. I think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the American foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.

Focus autonomous weapons on defense, not offense. In a defensive role, autonomous weapon systems have the potential to lower the probability of conflict. For example, if the United States deployed autonomous weapons that could destroy any missile targeted to hit the US or its allies, a potential adversary would judge such an attack as futile and avoid conflict.

The failure of President Trump and Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to coordinate what they would do on the $2,000-per-person coronavirus stimulus proposal disappointed Trump's populist voters and left Sens. Perdue and Loeffler in difficult positions.

In an interview with Fox News Sunday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders doubled down on Trump's comments during an impromptu Rose Garden press conference on Friday, when he told reporters, We can call a national emergency [to build a border wall] because of the security of our country. ... I may do it. I may do it. ... If we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving it a shot.
The governor, it would seem, is a big fan of props. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, he introduced a wall of masks during a press conference while hospitals were complaining of PPE shortages. Then in May, his giant Q-Tip comedy routine with brother Chris began on cable news. The governor also had someone make a bizarre giant plastic COVID mountain to go with his poster demonstrating at a press conference how he had flattened the curve of coronavirus cases in New York.

Limit which weapons we give autonomy to. It would be reckless to make weapons of mass destruction autonomous. If nations of the world automate their nuclear tipped missiles, one erroneous line of computer code could ignite World War III. It's critical that nations like the US and Russia, which have the capability to destroy the Earth, follow the policy. Thankfully, North Korea doesn't have a nuclear capacity anywhere close to the US and Russia, nor even does China at this time.
De Blasio's announcement came after California's new Democratic Gov.

And don't forget, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, constantly reminding we, the people, impeachment was her solemn duty. She didn't want to do it. She was so prayerful and somber. Of course, that also a lie.

WALLACE: President Trump responding to a brand-new Senator Mitt Romney, who wrote a controversial article this week saying the president has not risen to the mantle of the office, which understandably got a lot of attention.
To start the letter, committee chairman Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Miss., condemned the president's plan for a border wall, funding for which has been a sticking point in negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to end the government's ongoing partial shutdown.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I'm I am a little surprised because I agree with you. I think ordinarily Speaker Pelosi is a pretty shrewd political tactician. But I think here she got forced to do something she did not want to do in the first place, which was to proceed with the impeachment. You may recall her comments back in March of 2019, where she said only if it was bipartisan and the case compelling would it be worn. The divisiveness that would necessarily arise out of an impeachment proceeding. And then she proceeded after that. Months after that to basically cave in to the demands of the most radical members of her own party. I think that's what happened here. And now she's finds herself in a a bit of a box canyon. And it's not clear exactly how she gets out of this unless, of course, Senator McConnell succumbs, which I know he will not do to the entreaties of Senator Schumer to recreate the circus like atmosphere in the House, in the Senate. We're not going to do that. We will take it seriously. We will perform our constitutional responsibilities. But I think this is a box that. Speaker Pelosi has gotten herself in, and it's going to be fascinating to see how she gets out of it.

Chris Van Hollen: I'm saying that they have an obligation to present the evidence. They did not notify the Gang of 8. The one opportunity they had, just two days ago, to brief senior staff at the top secret level, they provided no evidence to support their claim of an imminent threat. Look, everybody knows that Soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy. There's no debate there. But the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported. And what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting Americans at greater risk. In fact, Secretary Pompeo's own State Department, right after these attacks, urged Americans to leave Iraq. So, obviously, they thought it was a more dangerous situation there the day after than the day before, and as you've just reported, we sent 4,000 additional troops to Iraq, this from a president claiming he wants to get out of wars in the Middle East.

Many Democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. It is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.

Here's the problem, the War Powers Act is not covered under that. This is a president taking a self-defense action for our country, taking it directly to our enemy, taking it directly to someone who previous administrations said was a terrorist and was committing terrorist acts.

It would be difficult if not impossible, Dershowitz said, to determine that a president has acted with corrupt motive, given that countless presidents inevitably consider both the national interest and their personal political gain when making decisions. Rarely do presidents act with purely corrupt or purely noble motives, he said. Often, he went on, presidents want to help themselves but in doing so believe they are also helping the country.
But I don't know if they'll actually choose him because there's many other people that show that they were able to get some base of support.

Top officials leave over Trump misconduct - Fox News: With just two weeks left before the Trump administration vacates Washington D.C., some staffers are resigning in protest after demonstrations breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by protesters following a speech by President Trump. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, East Wing Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, and Social Secretary Rickie Niceta all submitted their resignations after pro-Trump supporters mobbed the U.S. Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. Late Thursday morning, a senior administration official told Fox News that Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, resigned Wednesday afternoon as a result of the president's actions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mick Mulvaney -- special envoy to Northern Ireland and President Trump's former chief of staff -- on Thursday also resigned, telling CNBC: 'I can't stay here.'

Pretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included. What does it mean? It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes.
TRUMP: They will double down, again, any opportunity to hurt Trump. And that's the reality. I have said it over and over. I mean, the Democrats and the media hate Trump much more than they love America, because you can't dispute the numbers. You can't dispute all-time low unemployment for every group in this country, every demographic.

The factors that made the Iraq war a disaster are present here, false and dubious claims, hubristic thinking, lack of foresight and planning, civilian military divides, ideology eclipsing practical strategy, all of this means that while the Iran crisis might not be the disaster on the scale of the Iraq war, it could easily be a disaster.

The CNN narrative for four years was that Trump was a disaster and a threat to democracy.

Obama earned praise by moving forward with normalizing relations, particularly among those who said it was time to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations.

In his Cabinet meeting remarks with reporters present, Trump said he was in no rush to get U.S. troops out of Syria but did not clarify a timetable. Mattis and other Trump advisers tried unsuccessfully to persuade Trump to stay in Syria long enough to ensure that the Islamic State group, which has largely been defeated on the battlefield, cannot regroup. Nor did the president clarify plans in Afghanistan, where he has ordered a troop reduction on an unspecified timetable.

But she added: the fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge – a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened.

Chris Wallace: I want to pick up on this, because here was another one of your tweets in the last couple of days. The administration's reckless policy over the last three years has brought us to the brink, but the president -- and you just heard Secretary Pompeo say, no, it was President Obama who brought us to the brink; it was the Obama nuclear deal which funneled billions of dollars back into the regime that they used to spread their brand of terror across the Middle East, and also, it was the Obama administration's decision to focus exclusively on the nuclear program and to ignore all the other malign activity by Iran throughout the region.

What do I mean? They refuse to move even a milimeter toward a common sense comprise with this president. A year ago they were willing to give him $25 billion for a wall. They were willing to do that until Schumer pulled it from the table. Today, they're can't come up with a measly $5 billion? Think of all the waste, fraud and abuse in this town that they could trim to come up with $5 billion.

Shame on Mitt Romney. Publishing an ad hominem attack on President Trump in The Washington Post on the cusp of occupying a Senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the Oval Office was dishonorable. In addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about Romney: that he is not to be trusted.
Michael Anton: I don't know that I necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. You could interpret it as justified retaliation for all kinds of things that you've talked about earlier in the program that Iran has been doing without much of a response. So the main point I would want to make here is the Iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation, and when they finally do get pushback, they tend to back down and go into the turtle mode for a little while and that may yet happen again. We've seen that happen in the past. They haven't faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the Iran deal all around the Middle East, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they, I think, got overconfident and to some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that Soleimani went right into Iran and the airport -- sorry, into Iraq in the airport completely confident that he owned the place and that nothing would happen to him. So, I think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to maybe make the regime retreat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.
WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about the merits of a border wall. Here's what new Speaker Nancy Pelosi says.
Asked twice during a Dec. 6 debate with Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Warnock dismissed the court-packing issue as a Washington obsession.
RAY: Well, I think he's right about that. But I think you have also saw from the speaker, Pelosi, about essentially celebrating the notion that the stain of impeachment exists and exists forever. And the only rejoinder to that -- and that's the rejoinder that it is my job, and together with the rest of the defense team, to place before the United States Senate for their consideration -- is the question about the rejoinder being that there will be an acquittal forever as well. And that's what we expect. That's the -- that's the task ahead during the next several weeks.
Now, pallets of cash were delivered in the dark of night to the Iranian regime. Now, one of the most disgusting acts of American capitulation, I can recall in my lifetime.

At a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in 2015, I questioned then-Secretary of State Kerry about why the JCPOA wasn't submitted to Congress as a treaty. His answer wasn't a constitutional analysis or based on any other legal reasoning of any sort. It was a political answer. The reason the JCPOA wasn't submitted to Congress as a treaty, Kerry said, was because the Obama administration knew it wouldn't have the votes to be ratified.

FLEISCHER: You know, what gave me so much doubt about watching him in those interviews that he was giving is, when people start to say, everyone's in on it. You know he had to be aware of it. Everyone's aware of it and they offer no specifics. So he says the Vice President was in on it, the Attorney General knew everything about it, without ever saying, in a meeting on such and so date at such and so place, the Vice President was informed by such and so. Total lack of specificity so it's one of these sweeping generalizations statements that candidates make. Witnesses don't because he didn't witness the specifics. He has nothing specific to provide and that maybe just shrug my shoulders and say this is a guy who curries up to anybody and everybody, he tells anybody and everybody what they want to hear. He did it with Rudy Giuliani and now he's doing that with the Democrats and with their favorite TV shows so I don't think he'll advance the ball one bit.

The new administration should continue on the same path. The mutual recognition of Israel with several countries is a big step forward. Reports that some countries, like Qatar, that did not recognize Israel, are helping Israel's security by making sure there are no attacks on Israel, is also encouraging.

SEATTLE POLICE UNION PRESIDENT UNDER FIRE FOR TWEET SUGGESTING FAR LEFT PARTLY TO BLAME FOR CAPITOL RIOT
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement Saturday with a different perspective.
Typically, voters are not in the position to know whether their senators or members of Congress will control the balance of power in either chamber when they cast their votes. There are usually too many states and too many possible outcomes for that.
Future violations of the Twitter Rules, including our Civic Integrity or Violent Threats policies, will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account, Twitter said.
Tucker Carlson: As well as in the campaign against ISIS. Though he was little known to the American public, Soleimani was among the most famous living figures in Iran and also among the most powerful. According to some accounts, second only to the supreme leader of that country. The Iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge against the U.S. in response to his death. Now whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. But it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs we could be engaged in a conflict, a real conflict, with Iran. From Iran's perspective we're already there. If Iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff, for example, would you consider it an act of war? You would. So, what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've seen in Syria, it was a pivot point. Neo-cons in Washington understood that immediately. Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qasem Soleimani, tweeted disgraced former national security advisor John Bolton. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran. That of course has been the neo-con objective all along. The president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that regime change and war are not the point at all.

The court's liberal justices, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, would have blocked the regulation's enforcement.

The law couldn't be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Sunday. Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.

As for the United States, it should follow the lead of President Trump and his new acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, who between them have identified that we are in an era of great power competition that will require more effort and that the focus of that competition is China, and China and China.
CAVUTO: I'm sure it's not a focus on the campaign. I'm sure it's the virus, right?
Chris Van Hollen: My point, Chris, is we're now headed very close to the precipice of war. You just heard the president this morning talk about targeting Iranian sites, including cultural sites, which is, in fact, a war crime if the president was to carry that out. The point we're making is that the president is not entitled under the Constitution to continue this escalation and take us to war without congressional action. That's what the Constitution requires. Look, I heard Secretary Pompeo talk about this. You asked him about the maximum pressure strategy. They've not accomplished any of their goals. They had very unrealistic goals. All they have done under maximum pressure is escalate the chance of war with Iran, something President Trump said he wanted to avoid, but a lot of people around him, like Secretary Pompeo, have been urging a confrontation with Iran for a very long time, including when he was a member of Congress.

CALIFORNIA DREAMIN' - FOR ILLEGALS: New California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveils a new health care plan that aims to give more benefits to illegal immigrants, protect ObamaCare and push his liberal state even further left ... Progressive Democrats in California won a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature in November and control all statewide offices. Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, according to Newsom's new agenda. The previous age cutoff was 19, as the Sacramento Bee reported.
He added: But you have to go home now. We have to have peace, we have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anyone hurt.

Separately on Sunday, Trump talked foreign policy, shortly after he announced that Jamal al-Badawi, the Al Qaeda operative tied to the deadly 2000 attack on USS Cole, was killed during a U.S. airstrike in Yemen.

Now, we are talking about a guy that got paid, apparently, according to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, these are serious people there, millions of dollars from Russia, or a million dollars, and now, accusing President Trump and pretty much everyone in his administration of pretty much everything he can think of.

At a morning meeting at the Pentagon with the military service secretaries and other top civilian officials, Shanahan said he was focused on the defense strategy developed during Mattis' tenure. It emphasizes the importance of great power competition with Russia and China, after America's many years of fighting insurgent wars in the Middle East.

Will that happen? Well, obviously we're praying that it doesn't. But we know one thing. Right now, as of tonight, America is not ready for this or for any major epidemic. Thanks to the C.D.C.'s flood rollout of coronavirus testing, few locations in this country are even prepared to monitor coronavirus and the economy of course isn't prepared either.
He also said that protecting the nursing home residents was the state's top priority, calling the threat fire through dry grass.
The comments came after Britain, France, and Germany paved the way last week for possible sanctions to be re-imposed on Iran if the Islamic Republic continues to back away from its international nuclear deal.
If in Congress and I will do everything I can to assert our authority, we do not need this President either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.

All right, Raymond, years ago activists labeled the Oscars so white for lack of diverse nominees, but now it's a new label?
BARTIROMO: Right. Unbelievable. Robert, thanks very much.

Jim Antle: -- campaigned on the idea that we were going to shrink our footprint in the Middle East. I think that's what he'd like to do. I think he's trying to balance the fact that he would like to do that with the desire to be tough. The desire to protect American personnel that are still in the region, but he has a lot of advisers who are committed to the things that he ran against. He has a lot of George W. Bush retreads who are giving him advice on what to do with Iraq and with Iran, and the danger is that once you've done some of these things, once you've committed to some of these moves, you're going to draw more troops in rather than drawing down, as I think the president would prefer to do -- that there is no easy exit strategy; that there is no easy way out. So, the hope is that this strike is going to cripple Iran's capacity to be able to threaten our people. We can move on, and if Iraq does, in fact, decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, as was always likely once we put a Shiite government in charge of Iraq, that they were going to be friendlier to Iran than Washington was ever going to prefer, that we use that as a reason to get out, having accomplished everything that we're going to accomplish there.

The Democratic mayor and Anjanette Young met Thursday for what they described in the statement as a very lengthy, very candid and productive conversation about the unacceptable raid on Ms. Young's house and her pain.
I will attribute it to the president, she said. Even after his vice president told him that morning, 'I do not have the constitutional authority to do what you have asked me to do. I cannot do it. I have to protect and uphold the Constitution.' Even after the vice president told President Trump that, he still told his supporters to fight. How are they supposed to take that? It's an order from the president. And so that's what they did. They came up and they fought and people were harmed, and injured and died, Murkowski said.
By the day of the inauguration, January 20, 2017, the impeachment hunger was great enough that the Washington Post headlined Matea Gold's article The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.

In the election of 1876, former Confederates finally had enough power to brutally crack down on the Black voters in the South – the beginning of a nearly century-long effort to deny African-Americans the vote. That year, in three states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – Republican elections boards threw out results they said were de-legitimated by terrorism.

Dershowitz continued: If he wasn't running for president, he's a has-been. He is the former vice president of the United States. Okay, big deal. But if he's running for president, that's an enormous big deal. So the difference the House managers would make is whether the president's in his first term or his second term, whether he's running for reelection or not running for reelection. I think they would have to concede that if he was not running for reelection, this would not be a corrupt motive, or it would be a mixed motive, but leaning on the side of national interest. If he is running for reelection, suddenly that turns it into an impeachable offense!
FITTON: I've been calling it the 'Gossip Girl' impeachment and Parnas has more gossip to add about things we already know about, that Rudy Giuliani was concerned about corruption in Ukraine. I don't understand what the news is here. Parnas is not providing any evidence of impeachable acts by the President of the United States. It's interesting in the gossip oriented way but the idea that he has any evidence to provide the Senate and that's one of the big issues here. You talk about a senator saying we have to consider the evidence. They don't have any evidence.
Tucker Carlson: Yeah, I think that's right, and thanks for reminding us of that. Johnny thanks for coming on tonight.

Two decades from now, those of us still on this side of the sod will have a chance to reflect on the events of the fall and winter of 2020-2021. Will we say that Trump set a precedent that his successors followed? Will we say that the backlash against such efforts activated our small-r republican immune system against demagoguery?
Political appointees are the president's arms and legs in the vast bureaucracy. That's the purpose of the appointee.

Limit which weapons we give autonomy to. It would be reckless to make weapons of mass destruction autonomous. If nations of the world automate their nuclear tipped missiles, one erroneous line of computer code could ignite World War III. It's critical that nations like the US and Russia, which have the capability to destroy the Earth, follow the policy. Thankfully, North Korea doesn't have a nuclear capacity anywhere close to the US and Russia, nor even does China at this time.
Scott, it's something that's very, very important to him. It's hard to gauge where these markets go the rest of the year and all of that, but normally, normally they're kind of indicative of what's happening in the economy.

Succeeding U.S. presidential administrations and many members of Congress have said the embargo will not be lifted until Cuba moves toward more democratic reforms, like legitimate elections and freedom of expression.

Cavuto: Coast to Coast, Noon ET: U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.
The president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.
The number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December. Administration figures show that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a remarkable 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials have also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.
If they want to go down the road of witnesses, that means the president enjoys the rights to due process, which means he can call witnesses and lay out his defense.
Let's consider a hypothetical, Dershowitz said. Let's assume that President Obama had been told by his advisors that it really is important to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine. But then he gets a call from his pollster and his political adviser, who says we know it's in the national interest to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine, but we're telling you that the left-wing of your party is really going to give you a hard time if you start selling lethal weapons and potentially get into a lethal war with Russia. Would anybody here suggest that is impeachable?
But it takes a long time to get to the truth. Take a look.
That happens in countries, too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule.

If a border wall provides the political space for addressing these more systemic problems, then it may still be a worthwhile investment. That said, the proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border—like all previous walls —should be viewed as a means to an end, rather than an end unto itself.

It certainly seems odd that CNN is pulling Acosta from the White House rotation right as a Democratic president is set to take office. He insisted repeatedly that his style of shouting questions, delivering monologues, and heckling White House officials was merely about holding powerful people accountable for their actions, Athey told Fox News. Is CNN effectively saying that they don't want to hold the Biden administration accountable in the same way?
Sadly, as as Democrat, I must confess, that today there is no Democratic Senator or member of the House who appears to be willing to publicly put the country ahead of Barack Obama's White House.

Pelletier did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.
The remarks were similar to those he first made in California early in March, before the war against Iraq and the effort to get rid of Saddam Hussein was under way.
The so-called champion of workers, when given her own responsibility, is not following the law. It's unbelievable, said state GOP spokeswoman Jessica Proud.
that's what I think the difference is and that's why I got that piece so
Polemics alone are inadequate. Parties must have something positive to say along with the criticism of the other party's positions. Voters know that we have no real discussion on Trump's policies, just hyperbole, hysteria, and obstruction.
Unlike the use of 'In God We Trust' on money, which is only visible if one makes an affirmative effort to read it, the larger public display of 'In God We Trust' on motor vehicles, alongside bumper stickers and other signage, more clearly makes a statement endorsing the theistic assumptions underlying the phrase, AHA said. The problem, obviously, is that many individuals do not believe in a God, let alone trust in him, her, or it.
INGRAHAM: Victor, it is quite something is it not to hear this man described as some type of revered military figure like, he's just a scholar at Iran's version of the Hoover Institution, Victor, there you have it. And by any means necessary, must resist President Trump.
Congressman, what's the latest on where negotiations stand? Are your -- is your side willing to compromise with the president on the border wall, or are you, in effect, demanding his surrender?
SPUNT (on camera): I'm told Vice President Pence will attend President-
And what Obama missed was just pull everybody home and wish the problem away.
Delta Air Lines and JetBlue are the latest major carriers to cut the leash and ban emotional support animals (ESAs) on flights.
The U.S. Justice Department announced in October that it is investigating whether New York is undercounting coronavirus deaths among nursing home residents, and demanded detailed data from hundreds of private facilities. But as of this report, a senior Justice Department official confirmed to me that New York state has failed to provide ANY data as of their October request.
Romney excoriated the president in his op-ed by challenging his leadership and claiming he hasn't risen to the mantle of the presidency. Romney lamented the president's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and claimed his policies have divided the American people, caused dismay abroad and undermined democracy around the world.
Trump's first version of the travel ban -- dubbed by critics as the Muslim ban because it called for a 90-day travel from Muslim-majority countries Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, proposed blocking refugee admissions for 120 days and suspended travel from Syria -- was immediately blocked by the courts.
If now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated. – Alexander Hamilton, in his essay The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, Federalist No. 9
The group had issued 13 demands to Qatar to end the blockade, from shutting down the Qatar based and financed network Al Jazeera to demanding Doha completely isolate Iran. It opposed Qatar's continued support for the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups.
DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: I think you are quite right that they began with a diversity parade. You have two groups of people, the ones claiming to be diverse, Buttigieg, I'm gay, Cory Booker, I'm black, Kamala Harris, I'm black and a woman, so I'm a twofer. And then the other candidates like Elizabeth Warren and others, Beto, aspiring to be diverse, and pretending to be diverse in ways that they were not. So it was a diversity parade and a diversity charade.
WALLACE (on camera): Is it true that the genesis, the impetus for this came
Know your audience. To say all of this is outside of the mainstream of America is an understatement.
DENNIS PRAGER, FOUNDER, PRAGER U: Israel sent me into the Soviet Union when I was 21 years old, because I knew Russian and Hebrew, and I was sent in to smuggle out the names of Jews that I would find in the Soviet Union and to smuggle in religious items and so on.
Listen to what Barr said in that interview with ABC. Here he is.
Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia will be here. We'll talk about the election
Mike Pompeo: Endless wars are the direct result of weakness, and President Trump will never let that happen. We're going to get it right. We're going to get the force posture right. We're going to get our facilities as hardened as we can possibly get them, to defend against what Iran may potentially do. But make no mistake: America's mission is to have our footprint in the Middle East reduced while still keeping America safe -- safe from rogue regimes like the Islamic Republic of Iran, and from terrorist activity, broadly, throughout the region.
Pelosi what about the State of the Union?
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the president was willing to make a deal in the meeting, echoing Trump's remarks during his first-ever prime time Oval Office address on Thursday, when he called for compromise -- even as Democrats responded by flatly rejecting a border wall.
She is particularly helped by the emergence of her home state as an early primary. California Democrats will go to the polls on March 3rd as opposed to June, their traditional primary month. That puts the largest trove of Democratic delegates up for grabs four weeks after the Iowa Caucuses. If you can't play in California this time around, you can't play at all.
TRUMP: They just made it up. It's fake news.
JORDAN: I have never seen an agency where that has happened before.

Cruz, who won the Iowa Caucuses as a Republican presidential candidate in 2016, described the Iowa campaign trail as a beautiful part of our democracy that entails more of a grassroots approach and having in-depth conversations with them in their living room.
As much as I have always admired Bob Woodward and admire now him in the sequester fight and for his willingness to take on the White House, I cannot refrain from expressing my disappointment that this man, who did such a service for the country 40 years ago, has essentially taken himself off the boards of the Benghazi fiasco. I wish that if Woodward were to get in a fight, he would do it on an issue that really matters to the safety of the United States.
Among the terrorists set to be released in the next two years are the American Taliban John Walker Lindh and Kevin James, who plotted attacks on Jewish religious centers and American military institutions, noted Patrick Dunleavy, a former deputy inspector general for the state of New York, in an opinion piece for Fox News last May advocating for a national terrorist registry.

This is what happened for Paul (Acts 9). Hate melted away in an instant and turned into sacrificial love, in the blinding light of the glorified Christ.
On January 1st, just two days ago, you know, we signed into law and it's gone into effect where people that burglarize, that Rape 3 -- Rape third class, and a number of different crimes, violent crimes are now being considered not violent. And people aren't held when they get locked up.
Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions.
I think I am including myself as part of a group of members that wants to work to try to bring things together in the Senate and wants to try to get some business done, the senator continued. And this is going to be a [Biden] administration where I'm going to be disagreeing with where they're taking us on a lot of issues and policy, but I would like to think that we're never going to question their fidelity to the oath of office.

The new Democrats have arrived with more than a little fanfare.

TRUMP'S 'ABSOLUTE RIGHT' AS PRESIDENT: In an exclusive interview with FOX News' Sean Hannity, President Trump said he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency if he can't reach an agreement with congressional Democrats to provide funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ... The law is very clear. I mean, we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, Trump said. This is a national emergency, if you look what's happening.
Pence, before the joint session of Congress began, said he did not believe, under the Constitution, that he had the authority to unilaterally accept or reject electoral votes.
In a separate rebuttal, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., spoke of the effect of the partial shutdown on federal employees, whom he said deserve to be treated with respect, not held hostage as political pawns.

Well, they just made a huge statement that they do feel accountable.

We're not talking about Special Counsel Robert Mueller or the agenda of the new Democratic House of Representatives or the topsy turvy economy. Like the North Korea summit, the ill-fated election fraud commission and other Trump showstoppers, the semi-shutdown is catnip for coverage and the engagement of his longtime supporters but doesn't add up to much.

We've only gone up about one degree in a century in California. That's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed. What it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought.

TRUMP SAYS ELECTION WAS 'STOLEN' AND 'THESE ARE THE THINGS AND EVENTS THAT HAPPEN,' TELLS PEOPLE TO 'GO HOME'
After Trump supporters breached the Capitol, forcing the building into lockdown and suspending for six hours the House and Senate election certification sessions, the president did urge them to leave in a peaceful manner, but he never condemned their actions and repeated his unfounded claims that he won the election in a landslide.

To those who pushed Vice President Mike Pence to step in and send votes back to the states, Graham said they have cheapened the idea of constitutional conservatism. He said some chose the moment to advance personal causes, and it would come back to haunt them.
SANDERS: The president's prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders, to protect the people of this country; he knows that the number one job he has as president and commander-in-chief is to protect its citizens. And if he doesn't take that seriously, whether it's at our southern border or whether it's from terrorists coming from whatever way they come, or any other place that --

Ricardel most notably butted heads with Mattis while she served in the Pentagon helping staff top positions following Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election. Mattis wanted to bring in top officials to the Pentagon who were not Republicans, and Ricardel made moves to block Mattis's picks.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I think it's irresponsible and I think it defies reality. I mean, the truth is it's the Democrats who are trying to change the subject and trying to create a further circus like atmosphere here in the Senate because of their lack of success in dealing with this impeachment matter in the House. This is obviously a totally separate matter. I respect people what Democrats like Joe Lieberman and Jay Johnson, who both said in recent days that this is well within the president's authority and a necessary act. And I also respect great leaders like Ryan Crocker, who today I think is in The New York Times, wrote a piece about why this was within the president's authority, why it was necessary. And it was a former CIA director and CENTCOM commander, David Petraeus, who made the point that this is more significant in terms of our fight against radical Islam than was the death of Osama bin Laden. So this was a a very big deal. And I think the president is to be commended for his decisive action in the face of a real threat.
A spokesperson for JetBlue echoed similar sentiments, telling Fox News that starting Monday, ESAs will no longer be recognized as service animals with the airline.
Mike Pompeo: Yes. President Trump was right in what he said. So was I. We'll share all the intelligence if we can. I was the CIA director for a little while, Chris. There's things we simply cannot make public about what it is we knew at that time and what in fact we know today about the continuing activity. I think General Miller got it right when he said we would have been culpably negligent had we not gone after Soleimani when we had the opportunity. He was actively engaged and plotting against American interests. We need to look no further than what he had personally done over the days before that where an American was killed on December 27th. There's no surprise. There's plenty of public evidence about the bad behavior of Qassem Soleimani. He was a designated terrorist and we did the right thing.
GAO's findings are a pretty clear overreach as they attempt to insert themselves into the media's controversy of the day. Further, GAO has a history of the flip-flops, reversing 40-years of precedent this year on their pocket rescission decision, they were also forced to reverse a legally faulty opinion when they opposed the reimbursement of federal employee travel costs. In their rush to insert themselves in the impeachment narrative, maybe they'll have to reverse their opinion again.
INGRAHAM: It's time for the Last Bite. President Trump welcomed the college football national championship LSU Tigers to the White House today. Things got a tad colorful.

Mo Elleithee: My guess is it's not that. That's not it. But it is going to be a real issue.
INGRAHAM: All right, gentlemen, thanks so much. Great to see you both tonight. So what's next? What's going to happen next week? Well, first, senators are going to vote on Tuesday on the resolution we've been discussing this week, almost every night and that resolution will govern the rules of the Senate trial. So set out length of questioning, rebuttal and so forth and now at that point, senators will be able to vote on whether individual witnesses will be called. There'll be a debate that happens and that's when things get very dicey. So if Democrats get their way, they'll do everything in their power to exploit these witness votes.
HARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.

South Korea's military said it had obtained intelligence showing North Korea staged a military parade at a Pyongyang square on Sunday night. A statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Monday said it was checking whether it was an actual parade or a rehearsal. The parade likely featured new weapons systems in a show of force against the incoming Biden administration, observers said.

So how do our leaders get away with it?
SANDERS: Absolutely. He wants the wall and he wants a number of other things. We have a completely broken immigration system. We have national crisis, not just of safety and security, but a humanitarian crisis.
The comments by Trump – who's already said he'll target a handful of Republicans when they're up for re-election in 2022 – was his most explosive language to date – and it appears be sparking a serious divide in the GOP, which could have major implications in the next midterm elections, when the Republicans will try to recapture both houses of Congress and expand their control of the governorships.

Both of these organizations failed to intervene to save Navid's life, Koehler said. Now they must step up to save Mehdi's life and protect all Iranian athletes.

Their willingness to stand by while athletes are jailed, tortured and executed can no longer be tolerated. The IOC and UWW must act now.

The commander in chief said audits of Pentagon war spending must be private — an apparent reference to reports produced by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

But on Wednesday after weeks of mounting emotions, lawsuits to overturn the results, and an insistence from President Trump and his supporters that the election was stolen, the ceremonial duty became a jaw-dropping event pockmarked by a raid of the Capitol, shots ringing out, tear gas and lives lost.
The report looked at Cuomo's responses to the media when asked about the numbers, and noted that he brushes the criticism off as politically motivated and puts New York's nursing home deaths at just 20% of the state's total numbers of 30,000 while Pennsylvania is at 68%, Massachusetts is at 64% and New Jersey is at 44%.
But I think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. It doesn't achieve the objective. Democrats are committing to securing our borders. We have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.
The Times Union, an Albany-region publication, followed up with Cuomo's office last week seeking to view surveys filled out by nursing homes but was not granted permission. The publication said Cuomo's office pointed to exemptions in the state Freedom of Information Law that allow the records to be kept from the public eye.

MATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: That's exactly what Mitch McConnell's trying to avoid but as you mentioned, it takes 51 votes to do about anything. We know the outcome of the trial. We just don't know how we're going to get there right now. So as I look at what the Senate is trying to accomplish, it is trying to keep a solid group of Republican senators together that keeps its train on the tracks. If they can't, then we could have Hunter Biden, we could have a whole host of folks be witnesses and that's when, I think the credibility of the Senate is really - could take a serious hit.

Much of the international community regards the Golan Heights as part of Syria, albeit under Israeli occupation, since the neighboring nation took it during the 1967 Six-Day War. Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz have both called for the Trump administration to observe Israel's sovereignty in the Golan by putting forward bills, which the White House is yet to take a position on.

INGRAHAM: Yes, speaking of Biden's brother, you referenced it and the $1.5 billion from China, he got right for his fund, it was not clear that it went to him personally but that's what we want to find out. We want to find out exactly how much he personally profited Hunter Biden which I don't think anyone really knows but it's obviously a lot of money. Joe Biden's brother has been caught now, you've referenced in passing, trying to profit off of his family name, just like old Hunter. ABC news reporting, Frank Biden touted his famous last name and prominent connections in Washington to help land a series of charter contracts from local officials in Florida to open charter schools, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars over a five-year period. They brought him in for his name one critic said. Well, Eric you made all the money and then your family went into politics, not you but these folks are doing it the other way around. They had no money. They went into politics and then their family members cashed in.

In 2008, by the time of the first primary debate, all of the major candidates had declared their intentions and showed up for the first debate. John McCain, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, and Mike Huckabee went into the debate with their campaigns in full swing. Even the lesser-known candidates -- Ron Paul, Duncan Hunter, Tom Tancredo, Tommy Thompson, and Jim Gilmore – had made several trips to the early primary states and were in campaign mode. Only former Senator Fred Thompson waited several months to get into the race and found himself unable to catch up to the other candidates.

The Trump Justice Department has gone repeatedly to the Supreme Court to lift such court-ordered injunctions, bypassing the traditional appellate process.
But frankly, diversity is the least of the Democrats' worries, if you ask me. Their top three candidates, those old white folks, they are struggling to find a coherent message, and at this point are just at each other's throats. The Sanders campaign is reportedly telling volunteers manning the phone backs or knocking on doors to frame Warren as the candidate of the elites. When she heard this, Warren went on the warpath.
How utterly ridiculous. I didn't support Donald Trump, and there are lots of things he does I don't support. But the idea that he was the Manchurian candidate working for the Russians when he ran on an America First platform is patently ridiculous.

There was a very interesting moment on Friday because President Trump came out to the Rose Garden after his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on Democrats who want to impeach.

Bloomberg seems to be the only one who can make an argument for top-tier status thanks to his famous name, ability to fund his own campaign and track record as an advocate for gun control.

But with Trump on tape trying to bully an elected official into fabricating an election result and senators falling all over themselves to join Sens.

WALLACE: Well, let me ask Mo about that.
Chris Van Hollen: My point, Chris, is we're now headed very close to the precipice of war. You just heard the president this morning talk about targeting Iranian sites, including cultural sites, which is, in fact, a war crime if the president was to carry that out. The point we're making is that the president is not entitled under the Constitution to continue this escalation and take us to war without congressional action. That's what the Constitution requires. Look, I heard Secretary Pompeo talk about this. You asked him about the maximum pressure strategy. They've not accomplished any of their goals. They had very unrealistic goals. All they have done under maximum pressure is escalate the chance of war with Iran, something President Trump said he wanted to avoid, but a lot of people around him, like Secretary Pompeo, have been urging a confrontation with Iran for a very long time, including when he was a member of Congress.

Less than 30 minutes later, representatives inside the building were being evacuated amid reports of a bomb outside. And at about 2:10 p.m., rioters managed to blow past police lines and scale the walls around the building.
J.D. Vance: Well, Tucker, I'll give you a cynical answer and then a less cynical answer. I mean, the less cynical answer is basically that a lot of people just aren't very good and very smart at what they do and honestly I actually hope that's the answer because the more cynical answer is that as our country has successfully bungled or sorry successively bungled middle eastern wars and allowed China to rise, there is of course a group of people who've gotten very wealthy off of China's growing power and that's the financial elites who actually run the country who donate to the think tanks of course that produce the policy papers that so many of our politicians rely on and so I do think that one way of recognizing that there's been a massive failure here is that the people who have not been in service of the American national interests are still collecting a paycheck and the people who have gotten it right are still largely on the fringes and I think that's fundamentally a story of incentives and a story of who donors are benefiting from and who donors are paying to effectively issue what is propaganda.

It's unclear when and if any of them will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years, and reflects a shift in the party itself. A stunning Gallup poll last summer showed Democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism. The term Democratic Socialist was only broadly popularized with the 2016 presidential run of Bernie Sanders, who identifies as one. The enthusiasm behind his bid underscored how ideas that once marinated on the party's fringe were increasingly becoming mainstream.
That equals an annual average growth rate of 7.4 percent, much faster than the 2.1 percent average annual inflation over the period, Edwards said. The Capitol Police budget is more than the police budgets of Atlanta and Detroit.

Kinzinger backs removal - Fox News: GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger has called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against President Trump following a harrowing day at the nation's Capitol. 'The president is unfit, and the president is unwell,' Kinzinger said in a searing video posted to Twitter on Thursday, a day after thousands of rioters flocked to Washington, D.C., to stymie the vote to certify the Electoral College tally for President-elect Joe Biden. Pro-Trump supporters, encouraged by the president's rhetoric, stormed into the building, forcing lawmakers into hiding for hours. He called on Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet to use the Constitutional amendment to declare Trump unfit for office and 'ensure the next few weeks are safe for the American people.'

Tucker Carlson: Threats in the region. If you don't live in Washington, here's the translation. That would be in hostile middle eastern countries, places where American troops would never be in the first place were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like Max Boot [spelled phonetically] and John Bolton. But nevermind. No one in Washington is in the mood for big picture questions right now. Questions, the obvious ones, like is Iran really the greatest threat we face and who's actually benefiting from this and why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit? By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan 19 years -- sad years later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran? And so on. Nobody is thinking like that right now. Instead, chest beaters like Senator Ben Sass of Nebraska are making the usual war-like noises, the ones they always make. This is very simple, Ben Sasse wrote in a statement last night, General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans, which is essentially true. Soleimani was certainly a bad guy but does that make killing him very simple? It does not. Nothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever very simple and any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. Yes, Soleimani was linked to the deaths of Americans. Nobody mourns his passing.

In response, Sanders' campaign committee, which received the letter Sunday afternoon, said in a statement: We thank the signers of the letter for their willingness to engage in this incredibly important discussion.

And we will honor this principle with respect to this private letter.

The -- I spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and I think that is wrong and I don't think Democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize Democrats for acting like him. So I wish he wouldn't have used that language.

He didn't say what those measures would be. But while some people are suggesting they might ask U.S. troops to leave the country, the U.S. is, in fact, sending more troops over. 4,000 to come into the region. They're coming from the Eighty Second Airborne. They're heading to Kuwait. 750 have already come into Baghdad to protect the embassy there. So, somewhat conflicting ideas at the moment. President Trump saying that he does not want war, that they killed Qasem Soleimani to avoid bloodshed because he was planning more attacks on Americans. But at the moment, suddenly heightened, heightened tensions here. Tucker?

More recently, walls have been used to keep warring populations separated. Walls have long been a staple of counterinsurgency. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the British emplaced the so-called peace walls in Belfast to separate Republican Catholic neighborhoods from Loyalist Protestant ones in an effort to tamp down sectarian violence. Similarly, during the Iraq War, the United States military relied extensively on giant concrete barrier walls both to combat the improvised explosive device threat and later to help isolate sectarian hot spots, making concrete barriers one of the unsung heroes of the so-called Surge.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Lower energy costs are a major boon for small businesses, which use far more energy than ordinary families. High energy costs act as a tax on operations, reducing the available income to hire, raise wages, and expand. Especially for energy-intensive businesses such as manufacturers, low U.S. energy prices offer a competitive advantage over foreign competitors. Unfortunately, Democratic presidential candidates want to raise the cost of energy for ordinary Americans and small businesses by passing new regulations and taxes on traditional uses. For instance, every candidate wants to ban or severely curtail fracking. This would return the country to a position of economic dependence on Middle Eastern nations.

Meijer was turned off by how politicians' principles could be so squishy that they could condemn a president for doing something, but four years later praise a new president for doing the same thing just because their party is in charge.

Mr. Trump over the last few days has certainly seemed focused on the candidacy of former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And the president has been happy to echo some of Bloomberg's Democratic opponents concerns about the possibility or the accusation, at least, that Bloomberg is -- quote -- trying to buy the nomination away from the front-runner, Bernie Sanders.
But what was worse, Florin said, was having to buy her own flag, then learning that officials were not permitted to attend because of a back-up at the crematory. The family needed to return to the East Coast.
Multiple media outlets, including CNN, mischaracterized Dershowitz throughout the day as saying that presidents can do anything as long as they can argue it's in the public interest. Additionally, several politicians, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., falsely claimed that Dershowitz argued Trump's conduct was OK.
In light of the urgent humanitarian and security crisis on our border, the president is requesting $5.7 billion for physical barriers and border security, McConnell said. For some context, that is just about one tenth of one percent of federal spending. One tenth of one percent -- for physical barriers like the fences and barriers which already exist, which Democrats have previously voted for with enthusiasm.
Chris Wallace: Okay. And what about my second question, which is, if you -- you've got 47 Democrats. If they were to get four Republicans, they'd have 51. They'd have a majority -- assuming they all vote together. And then they could call Mick Mulvaney. They could call John Bolton. What's the prospect of that?

Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about us.

And that's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us.

MAC DONALD: They're scared. I mean, they're absolutely terrified of the racism charge. I was at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that talked about the criminal justice system.

Armstrong, said interfered with the GAO's oversight role on behalf of Congress.
SANDERS: You don't get -- it's not a quiet -- truth is truth. All right.
Well, I think health care is becoming that economic issue, because what voters really care about is for their costs to go down in health care. I thought it was very fascinating this week, when Bernie Sanders went around touting his Medicare for all plan, that even the Culinary Union said they weren't going to endorse him and even said, we like our health care, and we don't want you to take it away.

There's also Jane Raskin and Pam Bondi, both formidable female attorneys, they're just great attorneys, forget whether they're female or not. So you compare that all-star line-up, serious legal people, astute legal minds to the partisan hacks that Nancy Pelosi tapped for the prosecution. While six out of seven impeachment manager's hand-picked by Nancy, supported impeachment even before the whistle blower complaint. How's that for impartial? Further Schiff and Nadler and company couldn't prove that Trump committed a single crime and that's despite rigging the entire house inquiry and having the media in their corner. So do we really think Schiff is going to be somehow more convincing in the Senate chamber than Alan Dershowitz, a constitutional scholar who just so happens to be a liberal who didn't vote for Trump? Well, it's going to be a blow out for the Republicans and we're going to be covering it every step of the way. But here's the thing, the trial should even get this far. Mitch McConnell needs to put a motion to dismiss in the resolution that is going to govern trial rules. Now this impeachment is a complete farce, letting the trial play out with only validate the House's unconstitutional abuse of power.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is the Ingraham Angle tonight from Washington. And do we have a show for you tonight? My exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House. It's been a wild week all around in Washington. Of course, the rest of the world. The President passed a monumental leadership test this week with flying colors. First, we had an Iranian missile attack in retaliation for the killing of terrorist mastermind Soleimani. Democrats of course predicted World War III would ensue. And as usual, the President proved them wrong. So, now hostilities aren't a deescalated state and Iran may and I underline may even come to the negotiating table. No one thought that was going to happen. Second, the President and the GOP held firm on impeachment. And boy, did that strategy pay off. After weeks of delay, Nancy Pelosi is finally caving, and she will transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Her plot to control the Senate trial has been completely foiled. Oops. Well, I had the great privilege of sitting down with the President for a wide-ranging interview today. He made news on all of these important topics and a lot more and he shared his plans for the New Year. Here's part one of my exclusive interview with President Trump.

And they are our Power Players of the Week.

TRUMP: It's kind of interesting how that works, they all get into - they all get into business when their father becomes Vice President or their brother becomes Vice President. We get out of business when our father becomes President, it's kind of interesting. But for the Bidens, this is a business. I mean there's no question they became a business. You see his brother doing it and by the way, if you actually tracked down the schools, Laura, they ended up all failing, right? I mean it was - it was another it was another Democratic policy that ended up going into total ruins because all the schools ended up failing. So not only did he profit off of it but the system didn't ultimately work. They didn't get the end results which reminds me of most of Joe Biden's policy.

My biggest bet is that platforms like Facebook and Twitter, maybe even YouTube, they are not built for a world [with] a different Section 230. They're not built for that and I think by the time that they realize that it is a strategic business initiative that they need to take on, it will be too late, Toscano said. There are thousands of people trying to create the next social media [platform] right now… I think what's going to happen is, a new platform will pop up that is built around accountability and proper ways to manage free speech and these platforms that are now in the direction of censorship, because they've set that precedent for themselves, I think they're gonna start to crumble.

SLOTKIN: I think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that I love. And, for me, that's critically important. I don't like policy by Twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. If we're only anti-Trump, we are not doing our job.

COONS: Well, frankly, I think the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end. What made the confirmation hearings of Justice Kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing.

Successful properties will be ones that are able to offer guests added flexibility by way of 100% refunds for last-minute cancellations, along with other risk-reducing policies.

For example, Marriott International has just extended its 24-hour global cancelation policy through March 31, 2021. This extension into next year will be emulated by its rivals in order to remain competitive, Hollister predicts.

Aware of the resistance to killer robots, the US Department of Defense issued Directive 3000.09, which requires that weapons be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force. The word appropriate requires a human operator be in-the-loop (i.e., control the weapon) or on-the-loop (i.e., supervise the weapon) and have the final say in taking human lives. As a result, the Navy currently only uses the X-47B prototype in a semiautonomous mode, always keeping a human operator involved.

Obama earned praise by moving forward with normalizing relations, particularly among those who said it was time to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations. But others said Obama gave away too much, and got back little or nothing in return. And not only did Obama's actions not benefit the U.S., the critics said, they did nothing to help the Cuban people.

The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election, Twitter said in a statement.

FLEISCHER: It's just such a joke on its face because what they're trying to pretend is as if they're a real court of law and they're not. If the founders wanted to put this in a real court of law for a real trial, they would have done so. Then impeachment would have gone to a jury. It's not, it's going to a political body. It's gone to the House and now it's gone to the Senate. The framers intended it to be political because they want politicians who are accountable to the people to make these final decisions about whether you overthrow the people's determination from an election so stop pretending this is a court of law. If it's a court of law, why are they reading newspaper articles about it? Why are they appearing on TV? Jurors are not supposed to read articles about the cases in which they're hearing. So aren't all those Democrats who read newspaper stories biasing themselves? No, because it's not a real trial and none of us should look at it the way, we do and the Democrats should stop this silly game. No one 's buying it.

DOOCY: Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.
JORDAN: Yes. No, I mean, look, they never expected him to do this. One of the great moves the president made is actually release the call transcript. The transcript itself shows no quid pro quo. The two individuals on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, have repeatedly said there was no pressure, no pushing, no linkage of any type of investigation to the security assistance dollars. Third point, there Ukrainians didn't even know at the time of the call that the aid was on hold, that the aid have been paused. They didn't learn until about a month later from the Politico article. And the most important fact -- and this is one that the Democrats can never get past -- the most important fact is, the Ukrainians took no action, i.e., no announcement, no promise to start, no investigation, no announcement whatsoever about doing an investigation into the Bidens or Burisma to get the aid released. The aid was released because, over that pause time, that 55 days when the aid was paused, the president became convinced that Zelensky was a genuine reformer, and he decided to go ahead and release the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine.

Ned Ryun: We have entrusted them with political power and our monies to promote our interests, not the interests of non-citizens. I have to tell you, Tucker, this is idiotic on so many different levels, but this is how red states become blue and how America ceases to be America. You can't continue this behavior. At some point there are consequences. These are red state republican governors doing this and Trump is doing all the right things and they're abandoning him on this.
INGRAHAM: IOC announced today, and this is our final question, Mr. President, just announced that no politics at the upcoming Olympics, new policy, by any of the athletes.

Meanwhile, President Trump is enjoying the show from the White House. It sure looked like he was having fun Friday during our interview.
Mike Pompeo: These were threats that were located in the region.
But Mexico and China are also linked to the deaths of Americans. Each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of Americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. So, does that mean we get to bomb Oaxaca? Can we start assassinating generals in the People's Liberation Army? Maybe. Maybe Ben Sasse will call for that, too. He's a former consultant and a very tough character. But before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. Our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the United States richer and more secure. There are an awful lot of bad people in this world. We can't kill them all. It's not our job. Instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of American citizens. Period. That's why we have a government. So, has the killing of Soleimani done that? Maybe. No one in Washington has explained how. Instead, like Ben Sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. He clearly was. So? That's irrelevant. Meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. We're praying they don't, but they could. How do we know that? Because we've seen it before. We fought quite a number of wars around the Middle East in recent decades. We attacked Saddam Hussein twice, as you know. In the end we killed him. We invaded an occupied Afghanistan. We toppled Moammar Gaddafi in Libya.

KASRAIE: The government of Iran has about 4 million employees. So obviously they gave the employees the day off. A lot of people that you see there are from rural villages. They bus people in, they give them incentives like food. And as you know, right now, the economy in Iran is plummeting. People are hungry, they are jobless. The value of the dollar has decreased tremendously. So the people that you see at the rally not only are paid to be there, but they are intimidated to come.
How utterly ridiculous. I didn't support Donald Trump, and there are lots of things he does I don't support. But the idea that he was the Manchurian candidate working for the Russians when he ran on an America First platform is patently ridiculous.

What the European Union needs to ask themselves is, at what point do you consider a state a bad actor and take action accordingly, said Cohanim, who fled the Islamic Republic of Iran with her family in 1979, when she was 6, to escape its repressive state policies. Is it when the state underwrites terrorism and causes instability in entire regions? Is it when the state starves its own people while enriching its leadership? Is it when the state commits mass human rights violations against its own citizens? The Iranian regime checks all boxes.

Walls sometimes can create new ethical dilemmas. Walls can become the focal point for conflict.

Even in less extreme cases, walls—especially in populated areas—may disrupt trade and the free flow of people, inflicting a cost on the local population.

You look at Yemen, you look at all of the things that were happening including Syria. They were using, Pallister (ph) gave 1.8 billion in cash, 1.7, 1.8 billion in cash. Green cash, beautiful green cash. You almost - how do they have the power to do this plane load of cash and instead of Iran saying, thank you very much. It's really nice. Let's go and get along.

But I think it really is a is an admission by the House, in essence, that in the Senate Democrats that they believe that the basis the 17 witnesses who did testify in the House and the record that they develop there are really inadequate in order to make their case in the Senate. So they're looking for anything and everything, including additional witnesses, in order to bolster that case in the Senate, because they know what they've got so far isn't really sufficient to get the job done.
TRUMP: It's kind of interesting how that works, they all get into - they all get into business when their father becomes Vice President or their brother becomes Vice President. We get out of business when our father becomes President, it's kind of interesting. But for the Bidens, this is a business. I mean there's no question they became a business. You see his brother doing it and by the way, if you actually tracked down the schools, Laura, they ended up all failing, right? I mean it was - it was another it was another Democratic policy that ended up going into total ruins because all the schools ended up failing. So not only did he profit off of it but the system didn't ultimately work. They didn't get the end results which reminds me of most of Joe Biden's policy.

A number of high-profile lawsuits have claimed the government unjustly added people to the list and blocked their efforts to have their names removed.

The government was ordered to tell the plaintiffs whether they're on the list, spell out the reasons they are barred from travel, and to give them a chance to challenge the government finding.

State Department official George Kent addressed this during his testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry of President Trump, acknowledging that he told staff members there was concern over the appearance of a conflict of interest, but that no one told the vice president because his older son Beau was suffering from what was ultimately a fatal battle with brain cancer.

Conventional wisdom holds that Republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are Democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. Yes, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 Republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. Of the 15 Democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, were former governors.

That's one of the other benefits. It's sad perhaps for the Pete supporters, but this is what I think also is insulting. He has got about I think 10 percent now black support in South Carolina.

Minimizing touchpoints will continue to be a primary goal across the travel sector in the new year as hotels as well as airports, restaurants and other places have turned to mobile apps and QR codes to reduce the spread of potentially harmful germs. In 2021, hotels will increase their adoption of technology that reduces the number of touchpoints. Abilities such as online check-ins and check-outs, mobile keys and room settings controlled by Internet of Things (IoT) technology will become much more commonplace, added Hollister. Using IoT to control room settings also allows hotels to gather more data on guests, creating a more personalized experience when they next return.

At a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing in 2015, I questioned then-Secretary of State Kerry about why the JCPOA wasn't submitted to Congress as a treaty. His answer wasn't a constitutional analysis or based on any other legal reasoning of any sort. It was a political answer. The reason the JCPOA wasn't submitted to Congress as a treaty, Kerry said, was because the Obama administration knew it wouldn't have the votes to be ratified.

Barr: Trump committed 'betrayal of his office' - Politico: Former Attorney General William Barr accused President Donald Trump on Thursday of a 'betrayal of his office' — the latest rebuke of the president by a former high-ranking administration official after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol. 'Orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable,' Barr said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. 'The President's conduct yesterday was a betrayal of his office and supporters.' Barr's criticism on Thursday was not his first public comment on the chaos at the Capitol. As the president's supporters breached the building on Wednesday afternoon, he released a statement through his spokesperson that did not refer to Trump by name. 'The violence at the Capitol Building is outrageous and despicable,' Barr said on Wednesday. 'Federal agencies should move immediately to disperse it.'

And the question is, why not sign that bill, fund those agencies that have nothing to do with the border wall, and not hold those hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and the services they provide, hostage?
Tucker Carlson: My sense, my strong sense is that the president's preference is to leave, that it's always been that he's sincere when he says he doesn't want regime change and he's not trying to start any wars. He understands that those are not in America's interest and they're not in his interest either politically. I'm wondering, though, if the people around him understand that.
Second Anti-Trump Protest of The Day Takes to Nashville Streets – The Tennessean
Top Republicans, including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, had sharply criticized Trump's initial plan for a faster pullout from Syria, saying it would endanger U.S.-allied Kurds in the area, help Russia, and destabilize U.S. interests. In response, the White House has argued that America must protect its troops, and noted that it retains the capacity to strike in Syria from bases in Iraq.

GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I agree with you. It lends legitimacy to illegitimate articles of impeachment. The second one is an utter joke. Obstruction of Congress for asserting a legal right to resist a subpoena. If Congress disagreed, their remedy is to go to federal court, it's always been that way. So that one should immediately be dismissed.

I want to tell you how concerned the Democrats are about foreign interference in our elections. First of all, Obama did nothing to stop the Russians from interfering in the 2016 election. In fact, his administration spied on this president of the United States when he was a candidate.

And Mitch McConnell is going to sit up there and entertain like motions and have this travesty play out. This thing has been held in the House for obvious reasons, a failed strategy or whatever. But this is a flawed constitutionally infirm two articles of impeachment and even entertaining this in a trial to me sets a terrible and dangerous precedent.

All right, panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, the living will envy the dead. President Trump takes incoming from both sides. A freshman Democrat makes an obscene call for his impeachment, and a longtime Republican rival arrives in Washington and wastes no time taking a shot.
HANNITY: Downplayed? They act as though nothing wrong happened.
Tucker Carlson: Thank you. For more than 100 years the Boeing company has led international aviation. To this day it's measured by dollar amounts. Boeing remains America's single largest foreign exporter. But now like so many American institutions, Boeing is in trouble. Last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. There's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. Production is being suspended. In business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. How did it happen? Well, at least part of the responsibility lies with CEO Dennis Muilenburg who has been in charge at Boeing since 2015. Fittingly, Muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. Someone in corporate America is finally being held accountable for screwing up. But before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. According to recent SEC filings, Muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. That's his punishment. And by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. Here's some context for how much money that is. A rank and file employee at Boeing might make $60,000 a year. That's a decent salary in many places. It would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced Dennis Muilenburg is getting in his severance package.

It's not Iran, despite what they tell you in Washington. It is needless to say, China. Well, we're continuing to squander money and blood in Baghdad and many other capitals in that region. China is growing its economy at home even as it expands its reach throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, even the heartland of the United States. One person who's paying close attention to this, one of the few who cares, is J.D. Vance, the author, of course, of Hillbilly Elegy and we're happy to have him on our show tonight.

TRUMP NEARS NEW MILESTONE WITH JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS
Almost 30 years ago, an upstart freshman arrived in Washington to take the Capitol by storm. He joined a group of other like-minded freshman, forming the Gang of Seven, determined to challenge the old ways of Congress. They criticized its day-to-day operations. That freshman garnered national attention as a vocal back-bencher. But after a few years, the same member gained seniority and became a committee chairman by working within the system. That member? Former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).
NAVARRO: Yes, I am. The problem is what's going on in the rest of the world and how these vectors are going to impact us. But the issue here is to be ready, be prepared.
The range of reasonable assumption indicated that a wall would not have to come close to being anywhere near 100 percent effective to pay for itself, he wrote.

The fundamental issues Democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we're going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives, and we're going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way.
The president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, said Biden spokesman T.J. Ducklo.

It certainly seems odd that CNN is pulling Acosta from the White House rotation right as a Democratic president is set to take office. He insisted repeatedly that his style of shouting questions, delivering monologues, and heckling White House officials was merely about holding powerful people accountable for their actions, Athey told Fox News. Is CNN effectively saying that they don't want to hold the Biden administration accountable in the same way?

INGRAHAM: All right, I'm going to keep going.
MICHAEL SHEAR, NEW YORK TIMES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: We have still never seen what the President's legal defense of all of this is. We have seen his political defense, right? We have seen letters from Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel which are largely political arguments and we've seen the House members, the Jim Jordans of the world making largely political responses. We've never yet seen an actual legal defense.
MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.
In just a few short days after taking back control of the House, some Democrats have already called for the impeachment of President Trump, the abolition of the Electoral College, restraints on presidential pardon power, and proposed a tax rate as high as 70 percent for the wealthiest taxpayers.

Mitt Romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that American voters elected Donald Trump.

This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence, Facebook Vice President Guy Rosen wrote on Twitter.

There are numerous complaints from non-violent political activists who say they ended up on a no-fly list for something they said. Former Princeton University professor Walter Murphy told The Guardian that in 2007, he was denied a boarding pass in Newark International Airport. He suspects it was because of a high-profile lecture he gave that had been critical of then-President Bush. In 2012, Wade Hicks, the spouse of a Navy lieutenant, claimed he was told he was on a no-fly list. He thinks it was because of comments he made about 9/11.
TRUMP: Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office. I would love everybody to testify. I like Mick to testify. I like Mike Pompeo to testify. I like Rick Perry to testify. I want everybody, but there are things you can't do from the standpoint of Executive Privilege. You have to maintain that. So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic.

Ted Poe, who served on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, tells Fox News. As U.S. allies, their collective cooperation allows for the U.S. to pursue its interests in the region more easily. Now that they are cooperating, to a greater extent, it makes the U.S. interest more achievable.

Republicans have sought more information on the whistleblower ever since the intelligence community's internal watchdog found several indicators that the person might have a political bias. Fox News has previously reported the whistleblower is a registered Democrat and had a prior work history with a senior Democrat running for president. Additionally, the whistleblower faces an ICIG complaint for allegedly violating federal law by raising money ostensibly to pay for his legal fees, including money that could be coming from from foreign sources.

The meeting came on the 14th day of the shutdown, which was triggered by disagreements over the funding of Trump's promised wall, after Democrats formally took control of the House of Representatives. Trump has said that $5 billion in funding for the wall is non-negotiable, while Democrats have said they will fund more general border security -- but not the wall.

TRUMP: Everybody - I don't want to say. But everybody knows about the whistleblower and they know about the whistleblower's lawyer. But then, do you remember, there was a second whistleblower. I want to know what happened to the second whistleblower. What happened to the informer? Remember that an informer. They all disappeared when I gave the transcript because I gave a transcript and that blew everything apart, because we have an accurate. And if the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree. Everybody. Even our great Lieutenant Colonel, please call him Lieutenant Colonel or great Lieutenant Colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different. We'll change the one word, it meant absolutely nothing. The transcript was professionally done by the best people there. Just one second. So, we have a transcript. They never thought I'd release it. They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call. Think of this. I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.
But if it turns out and the Republican base sees that this looks like only Democrat witnesses and no presidential witnesses, I guarantee that the Republican base will punish those people who set off that kind of scenario.

Chris Van Hollen: I'm saying that they have an obligation to present the evidence. They did not notify the Gang of 8. The one opportunity they had, just two days ago, to brief senior staff at the top secret level, they provided no evidence to support their claim of an imminent threat. Look, everybody knows that Soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy. There's no debate there. But the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported. And what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting Americans at greater risk. In fact, Secretary Pompeo's own State Department, right after these attacks, urged Americans to leave Iraq. So, obviously, they thought it was a more dangerous situation there the day after than the day before, and as you've just reported, we sent 4,000 additional troops to Iraq, this from a president claiming he wants to get out of wars in the Middle East.

The Islamic Revolution that broke out in 1979 created a regime determined to export its brand of militant Shi'ite Islamism.

In fact, Dershowitz maintained that criminal or criminal-like conduct is impeachable, regardless of its motivation. And he did not endorse Trump's behavior.

He also went out of his way to take pictures with the entire team that was with us today. Unbelievable, really went out of his way. You made a lot of news in that interview lady.

As with issues like immigration and trade, on the Iran situation, President Trump has been forced to clean up the messes created by previous two administrations. Now post 9/11, George W.

Well, that was a colossal and cruel joke.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo took an early victory lap touting his response to the coronavirus pandemic with the release of his book last year, but as the nation faces another surge of cases, perhaps it was ill-timed.
More recently here in New York, with COVID-19 numbers rising at an alarming rate, the governor's office has suggested they may use the Javits Center again in case the hospitals get overwhelmed. In the spring, nursing home residents recovering from the illness were sent back to virus ravaged elder care facilities instead of being transported to the Javits Center. The governor has never been pressed on why they were not used more efficiently to help stop the wildfire of COVID-19 from killing seniors.

This is truly Trump's legacy project, and its disposition will have a great deal to say about the future of a badly divided Republican Party and also our capacity as Americans for self-governance in the era of brain-dead partisanship and easy disinformation.
Tucker Carlson: They're thinking, let's get some. That's what they're trained to do. That's their job. Their job is to be there, be ready and to not question so much why as to how and when. That's their job. But when they go, and they experience war like I've done twice and they come back and maybe they have an injury, maybe they lost buddies. They get 10 years older, 10 years wiser. They pay attention a little bit more to politics. And they say, Why was out there? What was I accomplishing, and what was I told? And how much of it was true? I think President Trump at this very moment is as inclined for military as he is diplomacy. And he's thrown the ball in the court of Iran today with a tweet to say, Listen, you're not going to win a war, but you might win at the negotiating table, because I think that is his end goal. And he may have made it through advisers or through his own wisdom to the point that he understands maybe that's all Iran will respond to. That's our hope. That's our hope today. Is that Iran responds to military force. We really don't have a playbook to see if they will, and it's quite a risk and a gamble. And it's ultimately the gamble of men and women just like myself.
HARMAN: It's not a national emergency. It is fulfilling a campaign pledge. The wall is a primal scream. In your conversation with -- your very good conversation just before with Lindsey Graham and Chris Coons, both of them made clear that there are ways that Congress can make a deal. That's the right answer. And I'm going to get in a fight with Josh because I think that Mitch McConnell, his old boss, who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called Playing the Long Ball, is bunting here and he could, if he chose to, rouse a veto proof majority in the Senate to pass what the Senate passed in the last Senate, which is the collection of CRs and then just leave one, that would be the Department of Homeland Security bill, with a shorter time frame to negotiate, have Lindsay and, as far as I'm concerned, Chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on TV, which maybe Trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it.

Finally, walls are a tactic (if, at times, a critical one), but ultimately, not a strategy. Because they can provide immediate relief to the problems at hand, walls can buy decisionmakers the time and political space they need for other instruments of power to work, and for those tools to prove decisive. In this sense, walls can enable victory, but rarely are the reason for it. The Troubles in Ireland came to an end through negotiation and ultimately through a diplomatic accord. The Surge reduced violence in Iraq partially by co-opting Sunni insurgents. And some Israeli policymakers attribute the relative peace in the West Bank compared to Gaza—despite both having walls—at least in part to the West Bank's continued economic growth.

The President has narrow, limited authority to withhold appropriations under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, Armstrong continued in a separate press statement. OMB told GAO that it withheld the funds to ensure that they were not spent 'in a manner that could conflict with the President's foreign policy.' The law does not permit OMB to withhold funds for policy reasons.

The challenge marks one of a number that the Biden administration will have to navigate if it wants to dramatically change track on immigration.

U.S. Protesters March Against Trump Presidency for Fifth Day - Reuters
The government is shut down, our border remains vulnerable, and instead of negotiating, Democrats want to establish another committee to investigate President Trump, Meadows said in a statement to Fox News on Friday. We're barely a week into the Democrat majority and already we're seeing a disturbing, myopic focus on targeting the President rather than solutions to help American families.

On the presidential campaign trail last year, Biden made the promise of reentering the Iran nuclear deal a pillar of his platform. It's clear he believes — as President Obama did — that he wouldn't even need congressional approval to take such an action.

CBS News: President-elect Joe Biden will announce Thursday he has selected Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for attorney general. Garland serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in 2016. But his nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued the American people should have a say in selecting the president who fills the vacancy. In addition to serving on the D.C. Circuit, where he was its chief judge until February 2020, Garland is a veteran of the Justice Department, leading the prosecutions of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Ted Kaczynski, the 'Unabomber.'
INGRAHAM: Mr. President when you look at the trajectory of your administration, huge progress on trade, incredible progress on dealing with our political foes, ISIS, incredible deregulation, judges, you've done a lot. On the economy today, we found out that still added 146,000 jobs, unemployment historically low at 3.5 percent. But we do have a little bit of a stall out on wage growth, which you ran on, and we've seen some, 2.9 percent last year, 0.1 percent over the last month.

Ned Ryun: This is unreal, Tucker. I mean, again, you pointed out that Trump gave him a strong backstop back in September and said you can opt out of this with his executive order and now you have these 18 Republican governors saying no, we want more. And they're saying well, we're following our hearts. This is, you know, Christian charity in action. I got to say this, Tucker, as a active devout evangelical Christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with Christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors and quite frankly a perverse incentive for these government-funded charities that are acting as refugee contractors grifting off the American taxpayer. Michelle Malkin has written about some of this but the U.S. State Department is paying these refugee contractors over $2,100 per refugee of which they get to keep 45 percent and then they're doing this campaign on these governors saying you have to put your Christian charity into action and in an act of cowardice most of these governors from red states are giving in to this.

It is unclear if Rainey's participation with her group on Wednesday went against DOD policy.
CRUZ: Well, starting with the second part first, I do think what we have seen coming out of the House is an abuse of the Constitution. And the reason is that they're using this for political purposes. This is the first time in history any president is alleged -- has been impeached without the articles alleging any criminal conduct at all, without alleging any federal crime was violated. They don't allege any federal law was violated. They don't even allege as much as that the president has a speeding ticket, and that has never happened in our country's history. And to use impeachment, like the House Democrats are doing, to express their political disagreement with the president, to try to overturn an election they're unhappy with, that is an abuse of the Constitution. Now, the first question you asked about process and witnesses, let me tell you what we can -- what we can expect to see in the next week or two going forward. On Tuesday, when we come back, the Senate will convene at 1:00 p.m. And we will start with pretrial motions. We will start with probably battling motions. What I expect the Senate to do is adopt a scheduling order laying out the next couple of weeks. That scheduling order is modeled after the scheduling order for the Bill Clinton impeachment. It's very, very similar. So it provides that we start with the House managers getting 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. They can argue evidence.

Members of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the Democratic Party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow, they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.
KASRAIE: Well, with all due respect to my friends on the left, I feel like, since President Trump has been elected, he can do no right. They have blamed him for everything. And frankly, I think it is time for us to have genuine discussions and debates. And I felt like, for me, the reason I even made that video was because a lot of my friends were calling me and were like, hey, what you think about what is going on? And what is your opinion? And I just made a little video because I just wanted my friends did on my network, the Iranian and people are happy. And I was genuinely just nauseated. Why do we have sympathy for a terrorist, when I'm getting videos and pictures from people inside Iran that are happy?

Trump team: Everyone is ignoring the massive fraud that destroyed our democracy!!!!!!!!
No one can call Tapper's show a 'straight news' show, and his Twitter feed is also a gusher of liberal hot takes. CNN's coverage of the Biden campaign -- and especially their 'let's hide' press strategy -- displays how deeply enmeshed with the Democratic public-relations machine they are, Graham said.

Many of the co-hosts took issue with Dershowitz's answers, including Behar who, at one point, told the Trump impeachment defense attorney that his argument was baloney.

So, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. But the fact of the matter is I think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.

Guy Benson: Do you have any sense of when this trial might happen because they have to send them over at some point, you would think, except the media keeps talking about an impasse or a standoff. The standoff is totally created by one sidedness, by not just passing along the articles like the last House of Representatives to impeach a president. Did I just. It seems I'm mystified.
We have been misinformed and misled by generations of public policy, education, and media leaders on the so-called 'separation of church and state,' Pritchett wrote. The concept has been so pervasive that we generally accept the idea that it is inappropriate to bring any faith-based ideas to the public square. The idea that we should separate religion — of any faith or denomination — from politics is not only false, it is virtually impossible.
And that brings us to Twitter's reputation. Conservatives have long complained about bias by Twitter and its Silicon Valley brethren, especially during the campaign, when tweets by Trump and his campaign and allies were blocked or labeled but no action ever seems to be taken against prominent Democrats.

A sign of possible tensions within the party was on display in November, when environmental activists took part in a sit-in outside Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., office, demanding leadership do more to promote the Green New Deal.
CRUZ: So, I'm very worried. That testimony that you just showed is Dr. Robert Epstein, who's a very respected academic. He's a psychologist, used to be the editor of Psychology Today. And he did an empirical study on Google in 2016 and on the search results they came back -- and he was astonished by the results. He found that, based on manipulated search outcomes, biased search outcomes, that Google in 2016 shifted 2.6 million votes towards Hillary Clinton. Now, here's the interesting thing, Maria. Dr. Epstein is not a Republican. He is a liberal Democrat. He voted for Hillary Clinton. So, politically, he was happy to see more votes for Hillary. But he was horrified to see big tech have that kind of power. And he went on to testify what you just played, which is, if they do the same thing in 2020, which all indications are that they're going to, they could shift up to 15 million votes. It is terrifying that a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires that now control over $5 trillion of the American economy have no accountability and the ability to censor, to deceive and to manipulate votes.

Nancy Pelosi says, even if you open up the government, I wouldn't fund a wall. So, that's why I'm depressed. You know, there's not much talk about what she said. She's telling the president, even if you open up the government, I'm not going to do a deal on the wall. And that's a nonstarter for the president.

Anyone in charge of defending the Capitol failed in their duties, Graham said.
What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded to it. We didn't question why Sandberg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandberg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It is not. It is bondage. Republicans should say so.
Nevertheless, Graham added, I am concerned when John Bolton's credibility is attacked, it makes it more likely some will feel the need to call him as a witness. In that event, it would be important for the President and his team to call witnesses on other issues.
Sharing two tweets from the president Friday, including one in which he said he would not attend President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, the company argued that they had to be viewed in part of a greater context.

His Tuesday remarks were delivered in a similar spirit.

Tomorrow morning, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will huddle in their weekly caucus meeting and I expect it to be more tense than a family meeting at Buckingham Palace, because you've got these Democrats and Trump districts who feel like they've been walked off the cliff.

And then even some of the more seasoned Democrats like Adam Smith, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee where I serve telling Nancy Pelosi, let's get on with it.

Washington is literally at a standstill over the funding for a wall on the United States southern border. Putting aside the politics behind the gridlock for the moment, the substance of the debate hinges less on the need for border security and more on differing claims about the effectiveness of such a wall. President Trump has claimed a wall would be 99.9 percent effective at stopping illegal immigration while leading Democrats argue a border wall is unnecessary and would be ineffective. And so it may be worth stepping back from the politics of the day to view walls in their historical context. After all, states have been building walls since ancient times. Some were arguably quite successful, others less so. At the core of prudent policy lies a basic question: What can walls realistically accomplish?

But, Romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted. Millions of Americans were fed up with a globalist agenda, tired of being told the U.S. had run out of gas, furious over the absurdities of political correctness – they wanted a change, and they elected Donald Trump.

You will find below our first list of contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. There are 35 individuals who have at least expressed interest in running. Some have already filed papers, some have set deadlines for themselves, while others seem more likely to be just musing in the media.
DOOCY: Ossoff claims David Perdue is the corrupt one.
We are proud of our investigating team and our reporting here on Hannity, because we got it right. We've been vindicated by the inspector general and we expect further vindication. FISA abuse, premeditated fraud on a FISA court, we're right about that. We were right about the unlawful surveillance of the president. Yes, he was spied upon by our own government at the height of an election, and after.

Mike Pompeo: Panicked aggression on the part of the Iranian leadership, because they know that the Iranian people are demanding enormous change. And they know that the Iranian people are supported by America in that demand for change. Yeah. We've built out a huge coalition, Chris. Gulf states, Israel, countries all across the whole world who are joining us. They are joining us not only in the efforts in the Strait of Hormuz, but in air defense efforts all across the region. The malign actor of Iran has been identified. Remember where we came in, Chris. Remember where we came in. In 2015, the Obama-Biden administration essentially handed power to the Iranian leadership and acted as a quasi-ally of theirs, by underwriting them -- underwriting the very malicious -- that killed Americans. Those resources, the money that they had to build out those forces throughout the Shi'a Crescent was provided to them by the nuclear deal. We allowed Europeans to go do business there. We provided them $150 billion, pallets of cash. All of these things are the very challenge that the Trump administration has had to correct. The strategy is working. We're going to stay the course. And we will protect and defend the American people at every step, Chris.
And then, of course, he somehow found the time to write his celebratory memoir American Crisis. We don't know how much his advance was for this book and it won't be disclosed until the spring but he received over $700,000 for his previous memoir. According to one New York website, Cuomo has pledged to donate an unspecified amount of the proceeds to a COVID-related entity.
Gab, a Twitter alternative that launched a few years ago and calls itself a social network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the new free flow of information online, quickly took advantage of the moment.
What I will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. And when you look at the way that Latino voters here in Nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to Washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump.

In at least a partial nod to the presumably mammoth cost that overhauling the nation's economy and energy sector would entail, it says that the financing of the Plan would be accomplished by the federal government, using a combination of the Federal Reserve, a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate, in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the Plan will be returned to the treasury, reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment.

If you're a senator, don't be surprised at the crush of reporters when you trek from your office through the underground tunnels en route to the Capitol for a vote on the floor.

On the House side, reporters prowl in the Speaker's Lobby behind the House chamber and roam the hallway near the Will Rogers Statue.

Bill Clinton. One of the strangest nomination speeches ever… By the end, I half expected him to say, in the spontaneous laid-back style of the whole speech: I've changed my mind. I nominate myself.

To make matters worse, many journalists – who are in complete denial about the legal and humanitarian crises at the border – accused the president of exaggerating the ongoing catastrophe. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, for instance, called Americans stupid for believing that the crisis exists at all.

America, the greatest nation in world history, is being destroyed, plundered and looted by the premeditated murder of the middle class. This is no accident, mistake, or coincidence. This is a purposeful plan. This is the boldest, grandest criminal conspiracy in world history.

President Trump has not always chosen the right words. He was wrong with his words in Charlottesville, and I told him so at the time, she told a Republican National Committee (RNC) dinner in Florida on Thursday. He was badly wrong with his words yesterday. And it wasn't just his words. His actions since Election Day will be judged harshly by history.

People build walls around their homes.

The assembly eventually settled on a policy that permitted only approved religious groups to give the speeches. But the Alaska Superior Court in October 2018, spurred on by a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, ruled that the policy was unconstitutional.
The reaction of liberal activists outside Congress was similar. These changes are designed to flip Title IX on its head and give rights to accused students when Title IX was supposed to be protecting those experiencing sexual discrimination, said Carly Mee, an attorney for a survivors advocacy group SurvJustice. Putting aside Mee's mistaken belief that Title IX protects only accusers, it is a shame that critics of the proposed rules see the investigation and adjudication of sexual assault allegations as a choice between protecting women and affording due process to the accused.
INGRAHAM: They're not even making any sense. Yes, he is a bad guy, but. If Ronald Reagan was the great communicator, Trump could be the great revealer. At every turn he is forcing Democrats to stumble all over their words, completely contradict what they said five minutes ago, and also the media, they are showing their true colors as well. In this case, they seem to be standing with Iran's sovereign right to exist to foment terror around the world.

WILLIAMS: No, not surrender. See, I don't think it's a matter of capitulation or surrender. I think it's a matter of saying to the president, let's be honest about this. You had two years of Republican majorities, didn't get done. You had the Senate majority leader say let's negotiate. You refused. So it's bad behavior.

You do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation. And this is unprecedented. The FBI, as you said, going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn, a Manchurian candidate, for the Russians. But what we can say, and I -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have Mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. Michael Cohen is not going to testify before Congress. I think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. And right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

Yet, the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic. Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. But mostly they're not. They don't have to be interested. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind.

Former Republican congressman Chris Shays and former Democratic congressman Gene Green weigh in on the president's handling of the immigration debate and border security.

That's not surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this.

Almost 30 years ago, an upstart freshman arrived in Washington to take the Capitol by storm. He joined a group of other like-minded freshman, forming the Gang of Seven, determined to challenge the old ways of Congress. They criticized its day-to-day operations. That freshman garnered national attention as a vocal back-bencher. But after a few years, the same member gained seniority and became a committee chairman by working within the system. That member? Former House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).
This is a stark escalation of language. Taken with other examples of bellicose rhetoric that have increasingly issued from Beijing officials, it is clear that Xi Jinping and his supporters have been badly rattled by the recent events.

Roberts, for now, has ball control because he actually receives the questions in note cards from senators, then reads the question aloud in the Senate chamber to be answered by either House Democratic managers or Trump's defense team.

It could be, Republicans have asserted, that the whistleblower coordinated his complaint with Schiff's panel for partisan reasons -- a disclosure that, if true, would likely undermine the credibility of the impeachment proceedings and possibly expose Schiff to his own abuse of power allegations. Thus far, the impeachment effort has arguably been elevated in importance from normal partisan bickering in part by the gravitas afforded to the supposedly well-meaning whistleblower at the center of the case.

Finally, walls are a tactic (if, at times, a critical one), but ultimately, not a strategy. Because they can provide immediate relief to the problems at hand, walls can buy decisionmakers the time and political space they need for other instruments of power to work, and for those tools to prove decisive. In this sense, walls can enable victory, but rarely are the reason for it. The Troubles in Ireland came to an end through negotiation and ultimately through a diplomatic accord. The Surge reduced violence in Iraq partially by co-opting Sunni insurgents. And some Israeli policymakers attribute the relative peace in the West Bank compared to Gaza—despite both having walls—at least in part to the West Bank's continued economic growth.
The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment on his permanent Twitter suspension.
MO ELLEITHEE, CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so.

Pelosi said if Pence won't act, the House is prepared to impeach Trump again. 'The president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' Pelosi said Thursday, a day after a pro-Trump supporters took over the U.S. Capitol.

Biden said to pick Boston mayor as Labor boss - Politico: President-elect Joe Biden has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former top union leader, to serve as his Labor secretary, according to four sources, ending a selection process that split the labor movement and stoked diversity concerns among Democrats. Walsh beat out a host of other names floated for the position, including Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris, California Labor Secretary Julie Su and AFL-CIO Chief Economist Bill Spriggs. His selection suggests that Biden was willing to overlook calls for a diversity choice, since Walsh is a white man, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders had been lobbying heavily for Su. Spriggs is Black.

Ocasio-Cortez had voted with Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.
Her proposed rules require schools to respond to any report of sexual misconduct and to investigate every complaint filed, while at the same time correcting the overbreadth problem in the definition of covered conduct and, most importantly, adding much needed due process requirements.

The contrast should be glaring for anyone who watched. The president was really sober -- he genuinely believes that a wall is needed as part of a larger border security policy. That's what he won on.

The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - better known to some as the Iran nuclear deal - aims to curtail Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions for a limited period, in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA in May 2018 because the agreement failed to stop Iran's drive to secure nuclear weapons or to halt its aggression and ballistic missie program in the Middle East, according to President Donald Trump.

The president has bluffed, bullied and wheedled his way into a very consequential moment. Now we'll find out what he wants to do with it.
As one of his first orders of business on Monday, Newsom declared his intent to reinstate the ObamaCare individual mandate at the state level. A federal judge in Texas last month ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, a decision that will inevitably be challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court.
TRUMP: I think it's sad. I do. I think it's sad. She is a great woman. I sat with her. I was supposed to be with her 15 minutes, I stayed an hour- and-a-half. By the way, I got killed by the press. She wanted me to stay. The press had no, no, he was supposed to be there, it's very rude. We had a great time. Then we had dinner. We were honored. Our country was honored. I sat with her for a long time, and she was smiling and laughing the whole time.

Sen. Warren, D-Mass., who has already launched an exploratory committee for a 2020 run, supports the idea of a Green New Deal to ambitiously tackle our climate crisis, economic inequality, and racial injustice, a Warren aide told Axios earlier this month.
RAY: Well, it's a big deal because, ultimately, in the eyes of history, we are all going to be judged about whether or not we acted in the best interests of the country. I think the president's principal defense -- and you saw it in the answer that was interposed over the weekend -- is very simple. This is an entirely partisan and, therefore, illegitimate effort by House Democrats to remove a president from office. And the remedy for that is the United States Senate, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. In order to overturn the will of the electorate in the 2016 election, and particularly given the fact that we are now in the middle of a presidential campaign for 2020, ultimately, that will can only be overturned with a bipartisan effort and overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, with a two-thirds majority, in order to remove a president and overturn the will of that electorate. It's very simple.

It's clear the same kind of retribution is going on in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) following Trump's firing of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The recent indictment of a Russian lawyer, over statements in a civil case that she did not disclose her part in securing a document from a Russian prosecutor, shows the length that these prosecutors will go to using selective prosecution as a tool for making a case against Trump.

And so, it's a new situation, the Middle East is not in the middle of anything anymore and yet he's saying that in this situation with Iran, we were very patient and now we've reestablished deterrence and the levers that adjudicate whether one side wins or loses a war or diplomatic, economic and military. And in this particular situation with Iran they have neither. None of those three and all their decisions are bad in their case.

And the last I have heard, I think there's been about 100,000 ticket requests for the president. We're proud to have him. We're proud to have the president. And it shows he cares about the big towns and the big cities, and he also cares about the little places.

The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Monday because the Nets did not disclose that publicly.
PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE DIRECTOR: So Tucker, there's a four part strategy that we're pursuing in Trump time, which is to say as quickly as possible. You start with the personal protective equipment. This is the masks, and the gloves, the Tyvek suits, things like that that our public healthcare workers need. We're making sure that we can secure those supplies tomorrow. H.H.S. is going out with an RFP to secure a half a billion face masks alone.
Facebook also permanently blocked Trump on Thursday night.
But he knows maintaining his -- and the court's reputation -- during a hyper-partisan impeachment drama will test his leadership skills. Colleagues say he is fully prepared for the challenge.

Why do you think the Democrats especially the Speaker, she's usually smarter than that? I mean I don't agree with her on a lot, but she's usually smarter than that.

And particularly given the history, where we've had the politicizing of intelligence over WMD [weapons of mass destruction], why we would pick someone who the very same issue has been raised repeatedly, and that is John Bolton's politicization of the intelligence he got on Cuba and other issues, why we would want someone with that lack of credibility, I can't understand, Schiff had said.
WALLACE: Then there is -- I guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, Joe Biden, who took it drubbing in Iowa, an even worse drubbing in New Hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, Latinos, African-Americans in South Carolina and Nevada, to -- to rescue him.
This should all be paired with a broader public health initiative to provide people information on how to be tested and the steps to take once the results are known.
GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. I would also note, that President Obama did make public comments about the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from Rodney King, right? So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.
It should also be noted that this stage of the 2016 election, at the same stage, the GOP actually itself had a more diverse field than the Democrats have now. They had an African-American candidate, Ben Carson, joining two Latino candidates, Cruz and Rubio. But remember, they are conservative, so they don't count in the Democrats' been counting.

As is so often the case, Trump forces Democrats to reveal themselves and the media. They're so caught up with resisting and hating Trump for everything he does and breeze that over the weekend, they literally sounded more empathetic to the mourners of an Iranian mass murderer than to the families of the soldiers he killed and maimed with attacks carried out inside Iraq.

Kinzinger backs removal - Fox News: GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger has called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked against President Trump following a harrowing day at the nation's Capitol. 'The president is unfit, and the president is unwell,' Kinzinger said in a searing video posted to Twitter on Thursday, a day after thousands of rioters flocked to Washington, D.C., to stymie the vote to certify the Electoral College tally for President-elect Joe Biden. Pro-Trump supporters, encouraged by the president's rhetoric, stormed into the building, forcing lawmakers into hiding for hours. He called on Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet to use the Constitutional amendment to declare Trump unfit for office and 'ensure the next few weeks are safe for the American people.'

Sen.

Now, the third time in American history. So he could. It could well be beneficial. And as to the second count, which is obstruction, you'll recall that the Adam Schiff did say he was wanted to subpoena Ambassador Bolton. But when Ambassador Bolton said he wanted a court to instruct him whether to comply with the subpoena or whether to invoke executive privilege, as the White House had insisted that he'd look to the court for guidance and Adam Schiff dropped it like a hot potato. So I don't know how this would come out the way I read the ambassador's offer. He didn't say what he was testimony would be, but he would respond to the subpoena. And I would expect anyone who was subpoenaed by the vote of 51 senators to respond. But what their testimony actually turns out to be, that's another matter.

Trump, who upended the Republican establishment in winning the White House, is declaring rhetorical war on any official in his party who dares cross him over the election he insists is rigged. Loyalty to the Donald is the only criteria that matters. Otherwise he and his allies dismiss you as a RINO, someone who needs to be expelled from the ranks.
His boss, National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, also weighed leaving, but was talked into staying by allies, the news service reported.
Under the Trump administration, America's maximum pressure campaign on Iran crippled the regime, eliminated the ISIS caliphate, killed terrorists Qassem Soleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and took other decisive action without starting any new military conflict anywhere on the globe.

My friends, like everything else, this is all about politics for the Democrats. Pretty much every demographic group is doing better now than they were a few years ago. The Democrats don't have any have no answer. They've completely given up trying to outdo Trump on raising the standard of living for Americans. So, all they have to run on is this shutdown and their opposition to his wall. Oh, and Trump's a racist. That's all they have.
And that brings us to Twitter's reputation. Conservatives have long complained about bias by Twitter and its Silicon Valley brethren, especially during the campaign, when tweets by Trump and his campaign and allies were blocked or labeled but no action ever seems to be taken against prominent Democrats.
WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the president's thought about declaring a national emergency we got this tweet from Greg Engle. By declaring a national emergency, will this open the door for future -- future presidents to do the same over topics such as climate change, health care, or even gun control laws because of mass shootings? Is this really a national emergency or just fulfilling a campaign pledge?

CRUZ: Well, look, there's no doubt Joe Biden served with an awful lot of senators. There are a number of senators who consider him a personal friend. I am hopeful and I believe that senators will do their constitutional duty, which means that they're not going to decide this case based on friendship, but, rather -- there was a reason that the framers of the Constitution gave the responsibility of conducting an impeachment trial to the Senate. They debated quite a bit where to do the impeachment, particularly of a president.

Historically, walls were used to keep invaders out. The early Chinese states built what has become known as the Great Wall to protect themselves against the nomadic groups of the Steppes. Roman Emperor Hadrian constructed a wall across the British isle separating the Roman domain from troublesome northern tribes. More recently, Israel has employed several walls—along the West Bank and Gaza, as well as along its northern and southern borders, to protect itself from terrorism, smuggling, illegal immigration and other threats.

The effort by House Democrats to obstruct, resist, impeach and oppose everything and anything is not in the best interest of our country, Zeldin said in a statement to Fox News on Friday.

There's things we simply cannot make public about what it is we knew at that time and what in fact we know today about the continuing activity. I think General Miller got it right when he said we would have been culpably negligent had we not gone after Soleimani when we had the opportunity. He was actively engaged and plotting against American interests. We need to look no further than what he had personally done over the days before that where an American was killed on December 27th. There's no surprise. There's plenty of public evidence about the bad behavior of Qassem Soleimani. He was a designated terrorist and we did the right thing.

Not only has Cuomo and his administration failed to provide any information to the Justice Department, lawmakers, Hammond, or countless reporters and grieving families who have asked they be disclosed, he also prefers to blame others for his disastrous mandate and instead says all of it is politically motivated.

It is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people, but it's incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so, Deere told Fox News. Big Tech is out of control.
The Trump administration has faced bipartisan criticism in recent months for changes instituted by Michael Pack, a right-leaning documentarian appointed as head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent of VOA.
According to a statement issued by the prime minister's office, among the units approved would be 100 new homes for the Tal Menashe settlement, where Ester Horgan, a 53-year-old mother of six, was murdered by a Palestinian assailant last month while jogging in a nearby forest.

And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-.Ky., who met with Vice President Mike Pencc on Capitol Hill earlier in the day, did not answer when asked by Fox News on Tuesday whether he thought declaring a national emergency would be a good idea. But in a statement and remarks on the Senate floor, McConnell emphasized his support for the White House's aggressive tack.
President-elect Joe Biden will benefit from Operation Warp Speed and other Trump administration initiatives, the Townhall.com editor said.
BARTIROMO: So, this is the first time we will hear from the president. Of course, the president and the White House coming out with a statement last night ahead of the trial. Would you agree that this could be as shore as two weeks? What is your expectation?
The unofficial primaries held in July last year attracted more than 600,000 voters even though pro-Beijing lawmakers and politicians had warned the event could breach the security law. Pro-democracy figures had hoped to use the vote to build support and win a majority of seats in the legislature, which they could use to vote against bills they deemed to be pro-Beijing, block budgets and paralyze the government.
The Michigan Democratic Party issued a statement saying that though it applauds the fact the commission has finally put their authority to use, it is not enough and that all firearms should be banned inside the Capitol.
TRUMP: I think that's what they believe, at the same time as I said before, he can't get through a sentence without stumbling. He's got real problems. I mean here's a man that was in the Senate for longer than I've been alive, Laura, right? Yet he blames all of America's problems on my father. It's kind of ironic how that works. Here's a guy who gave Iran $150 billion. They ended up building missiles that they did shot at one of our air bases. Here's a guy a guy who has a son, who profited in you know off of the presidency of the United States, of a vice presidency of United States, took $1.5 billion from China just a couple days ago. ABC reported that his brother was doing the same thing as it came to charter schools in Florida. This guy's got a lot of problems. This guy has a lot of problems aside from the fact that he lacks charisma and again, he hasn't exactly been a good mouth piece for them because he keeps on stumbling and going off on these terrible rants. He's got real problems.

CHAFFETZ: Protecting our borders is the right side of the argument.
Democrats were doing this, the Republicans would yell treason.
RAY: Well, that's a -- that's a relevant issue to consider, obviously, because, if you get into the question, as the Democrats have alleged, that anything having to do with the Bidens was completely, in their words, a sham, obviously, your views about that are affected by whether or not you think there was merit to a Biden investigation. But before we ever get to that, I think the core issue -- and Senator Cruz alluded to this -- well-founded -- and I have said this many times -- many times on your show -- well-founded articles of impeachment both allege that crimes were committed and that those are the type of crimes that constitute abuse of the public trust. Abuse of power alone -- and history has shown this -- similar to also obstruction of Congress, those types of articles of impeachment have been tried on for size before, but they have not fared well. The core of the impeachment parameters allege that crimes have been committed, treason, bribery, and things like that, in other words, other high crimes and misdemeanors.
Obama, too, incorporated a green plan into his $825 billion economic stimulus package which targeted the efficiency of federal buildings and home improvement like added insulation. But his plan was regarded as lackluster and slow to start.

Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth. There is no evidence that Iran started behaving any better after the deal and in no serious Republican or Democrat is even attempting at this point to argue that. Iran never released Bob Levinson, a former CIA officer, whom they've held for 13 years, ditto for at least five other American who've been held prisoner on absurd spurious grounds.

CRUZ: Hunter Biden had zero experience in oil and gas. It's not like he was a geologist or geophysicist. He was getting that money, the obvious inference is, because his daddy was vice president. And Joe Biden is on video at the Council of Foreign Relations bragging that he blocked a billion dollars in foreign loans and foreign aid to Ukraine until they fired the prosecutor who was potentially investigating Burisma, the company on which Hunter Biden sat on the board. When -- if the Biden family is profiting to the tunes of millions of dollars, the president is entirely justified to say, let's investigate and find out what happened. That's why Hunter Biden is such an important witness and why the Democrats don't want to focus on, what was the evidence of actual corruption? I expect to hear a lot from that -- from the White House defense team this week.
Ned Ryun: We have entrusted them with political power and our monies to promote our interests, not the interests of non-citizens. I have to tell you, Tucker, this is idiotic on so many different levels, but this is how red states become blue and how America ceases to be America. You can't continue this behavior.

And then starting 2020, starting an election year, she's coming out of the gate with a miscalculation with regard to these articles of impeachment and winning extra-long in order to send them over. A lot of miscalculations done by. I think it's going to be paid at the polls in November. And what she should be doing if she was smart, because she has all these Democrats in districts that Donald Trump won. She should be talking about delivering them wins to go back to their district, but instead all those Trump voters have to be fuming at these Democrats who represent, because they didn't send them to Washington to impeach the President--

TRUMP: I think you could see the media has got it in for -- to sort of doing the full press to make sure that Biden is the guy, which is great, in a way, because, I mean, I'd sort of like to see Trump go one-on-one with Biden. When I see Joe Biden talking to a group of 20 people with a teleprompter, because they're afraid of what he may say otherwise, that tells me all I need to know. And in a large and stacked Democrat field, I think it's fine. You can probably hide some of that. Get him on the trail for five, six months one- on-one with Donald Trump, it's going to be awesome.

But I think the legislative path is just about shut off because Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House, said, even if you open up the government, I will give you $1 for the wall. As long as that's the case, we are never going to get a legislative package no matter what the Senate does.
JOHNSON: And so again, I don't know what Nancy Pelosi is doing to me. Her strategy seems totally bizarre. What I hope is this week, our conference will come together. I don't think we should let Nancy Pelosi run the Senate. And so, the Wall Street Journal, you should have had a column a couple weeks ago basically suggesting we should change the rules of Senate, don't require articles of impeachment be delivered. They already voted on it. We take up the trial. We basically tell Nancy Pelosi; we start the trial Tuesday at 1 o'clock.

GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.

Jim Antle: -- campaigned on the idea that we were going to shrink our footprint in the Middle East. I think that's what he'd like to do. I think he's trying to balance the fact that he would like to do that with the desire to be tough. The desire to protect American personnel that are still in the region, but he has a lot of advisers who are committed to the things that he ran against. He has a lot of George W. Bush retreads who are giving him advice on what to do with Iraq and with Iran, and the danger is that once you've done some of these things, once you've committed to some of these moves, you're going to draw more troops in rather than drawing down, as I think the president would prefer to do -- that there is no easy exit strategy; that there is no easy way out. So, the hope is that this strike is going to cripple Iran's capacity to be able to threaten our people. We can move on, and if Iraq does, in fact, decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, as was always likely once we put a Shiite government in charge of Iraq, that they were going to be friendlier to Iran than Washington was ever going to prefer, that we use that as a reason to get out, having accomplished everything that we're going to accomplish there.

TRUMP: If we're hearing from all of those witnesses, then I want to sort of hear it, because I realize, again, having watched this thing transpire over the last few years and the nonsense perpetuate itself, I definitely want to hear from the other side. If the Republicans -- and some of them, the, let's call it weaker Republicans -- I sort of like the Rand Paul model -- make them vote on it. If some of those guys don't want to hear from the witnesses that we'd want to hear from, but we will hear from the others, I want to know about it, because they don't deserve to be in office. So it really depends. We have to play the game the way the Democrats have played the game. We have to play hard, but fair. Hearing from everyone is totally fair. That's not what we have seen so far, while the Democrats have controlled the process. It's not been fair in any way, shape or form.

The president, before and after his election, promised that Mexico is going to pay for the wall.

They can argue law and argue whatever they want. After that, the president and the White House, they get 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. Then we shift questions from senators. Senators get 16 hours. Our questions have to be in writing, and the chief justice asks them for us. All of that, I would anticipate, takes about a week -- a week to a week-and-a-half. At that point, what the scheduling order provides is, the Senate is going to vote on whether or not additional witnesses are necessary. That's a 51- vote threshold. I don't know how that vote is going to come out. I think all 47 Democrats will vote yes. The open question is whether there will be four Republicans to join with those 47 Democrats. And, look, I think some of that depends on what happens in the first week- and-a-half, what arguments the House managers put forward, what arguments the White House puts forward, what questions comes out. I hope, at the end of the week-and-a-half, where Republican senators are is -- is, we have heard enough. The evidence they have put forward doesn't satisfy the constitutional standards.

J. V. Last: 'The Trump Primary Has Already Begun' - The Bulwark: The smartest thing Barack Obama ever did was running for president when everyone thought Hillary Clinton was invincible. The second smartest thing he did was invite Clinton into his Cabinet and keep her there through his first term. Obama understood that avoiding a primary challenge is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for re-election. … President Trump, on the other hand, seems to be daring someone to run against him in 2020. He frequently insults his fellow Republicans and has made almost no effort to mend fences… He did not bring the people most likely to run against him—John Kasich and Mitt Romney—into his administration. And he has not kept the people who would be most dangerous to him—Nikki Haley and Jim Mattis—on his team. If you only looked at this top-line data, you'd almost think Trump wants a primary challenger. Maybe he does.

Consequently when Donald Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, exercising the authority he believed he had as president of the United States, he was taking the very action he made famous. It wasn't out of character for him but in character, as he has been throughout his administration. If anything, it's hard to find anyone who has not been fired or threatened with firing. It's what he does.

These stealth, jet-powered autonomous aircraft can aerially refuel and penetrate deep inside a well-defended territory to gather intelligence and strike enemy targets, a more aggressively lethal tool than we've seen before.

I will also say this, Chris -- I was very concerned by President Trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that Vladimir Putin's Russia had interfered in our 2016 election. There's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of President Trump to complement President Putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from Syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for President Putin.

But investigations to come fast and furious - Politico: Democrats want to investigate the Trump Hotel deal and President Donald Trump's taxes. They want to haul up conflicted Cabinet officials and dig into controversial changes to the census and food stamps. They want to put Education Secretary Betsy DeVos under oath and investigate child detentions at the border. The threat of subpoenas, investigations and oversight hearings will dominate the new House Democratic majority agenda, targeting the White House's most controversial policies and personnel, spanning immigration, the environment, trade and of course, the biggest question of them all: Russian collusion. … But for House Democrats in control for the first time in nearly a decade, it's also a role full of pitfalls. Trump has already tried to brand the prospect of congressional oversight as nothing more than 'harassment,' and Democrats will also have to show they can legislate, govern and investigate all at the same time in the House.

The development is, in part, an outgrowth of the crackdown on opioids in the U.S., and the result of cartels finding other drugs. The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA), released last fall, noted the rise of more potent forms of meth and cocaine in the United States.

There has been no factual basis for these allegations against Joe Biden to ask the Senate, do these investigations that the President fraudulently sought to get Ukraine to conduct would merely turn the Senate trial on its head. Now that's something the President would love. But that's not a fair trial. That's a sham trial.

Biden said to pick Boston mayor as Labor boss - Politico: President-elect Joe Biden has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former top union leader, to serve as his Labor secretary, according to four sources, ending a selection process that split the labor movement and stoked diversity concerns among Democrats. Walsh beat out a host of other names floated for the position, including Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris, California Labor Secretary Julie Su and AFL-CIO Chief Economist Bill Spriggs. His selection suggests that Biden was willing to overlook calls for a diversity choice, since Walsh is a white man, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders had been lobbying heavily for Su. Spriggs is Black.
A contentious, closed-door meeting on border security at the White House Wednesday ended without any progress.

Romney flipflopped again after Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, doing what the Washington Post called a stunning 180 on Donald Trump and sucked up to Mr. Trump to be his Secretary of State. And then in early 2018, when Romney faced a serious primary challenge to be the Republican candidate to succeed retiring Utah Senator Orin Hatch, Romney gratefully accepted President Trump's endorsement which Mr. Trump expressed in this tweet:

According to CNN, an MSNBC spokesperson said that such decisions are made on a case by case basis driven by the substance of the briefings and the pace of the day's news.

The media really didn't care about the scandal that broke. The L.A. Times and a few others did. And here's what they wrote: The chief of China's military intelligence secretly directed funds from Beijing to help reelect President Clinton in 1996. Former Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung told federal investigators. Chung said he met three times with intelligence officials who ordered $300,000 deposited into the Torrance businessman's bank account to subsidize campaign donations intended for Clinton, according to sources.

Trump campaign moving fast to rig nomination - Politico: President Donald Trump is tightening his iron grip on the Republican Party, launching an elaborate effort to stamp out any vestiges of GOP opposition that might embarrass him at the 2020 Republican convention. The president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. The effort comes as party elites like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney are openly questioning Trump's fitness for the job, and it's meant to ensure that delegates to next year's convention in Charlotte, N.C., are presidential loyalists… Trump political aides Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, the organizers of the project, held a national conference call with Republican state party chairs, who traditionally play an outsize role in picking delegates. Last week, the two advisers began having one-on-one calls with the state chairs to describe the campaign's mission and discuss various circumstances in each state.
In particular, Roberts' dramatic 2012 deciding vote upholding the key funding provision of the Affordable Care Act triggered conservative criticism that it was a calculated act of betrayal, a narrative Trump was all too eager to exploit on the campaign trail.

Michael Anton: Well, it's been a long time since an incumbent president was defeated for reelection: 1992. There's enormous advantages to incumbency.
Mike Pompeo: It's interesting. I haven't heard any of the congressional leaders who have seen the full set of intelligence make the comments that you just described. I think any reasonable person who saw the intelligence that the senior American leaders had in their possession would've come to the same conclusion that President Trump and our leadership team did about the fact that there would have been more risk to America, more risk through inaction than there was through the action that we took. I think it's very clear. I think it's very plain. We'll do everything we can to share this information with the American people, but I think the American people understand too, there's certain things you just can't -- you can't put out in public. You got to protect Americans who are out collecting the intelligence. The intelligence we will need in the days and weeks ahead to continue to defend and protect them.

No. What is an assault-style weapon under the statute? As I'm reading the statute, it's any semiautomatic weapon that holds 10, correct, 10 in the clip, 10 or more in the clip? Most Sig Sauer, we have pictures of them, Sig Sauer 9-millimeter, Glock 9 millimeter, ARs, AK style weapon, the most popular hunting rifle in the United States is the AR-15, correct, depending on the size of the clip would be banned, those style guns?

And then even some of the more seasoned Democrats like Adam Smith, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee where I serve telling Nancy Pelosi, let's get on with it.

And what that does is provide the impeachment managers from the House and the president's defense team the opportunity to lay out their cases. And what is agreed to at the front end is that framework. After you get through that framework, then senators are -- after they go through a series of questioning, are able to look at what's missing.

INGRAHAM: On the human rights issue in China, you don't talk a lot about it, but it concerns a lot of your strongest supporters, evangelical Christians, Catholics, other people who are really concerned about human rights. You've got 1 million people in reeducation camps, internment camps, Catholics getting missiles in their pews at Christmas that had tributes to Xi instead of Silent Night, crazy stuff happening. Reagan saw the power of the moral argument for freedom and married it to the economic and military argument for peace through strength. Can you do more on that front without damaging your ability to make future trade agreements, more on the human rights front?
This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people, Trump said. We have to have peace.
Congressman Nunes joins me now exclusively.
Both Schumer and Pelosi feel captured by the extreme left of the Democratic Party, and so they have forced the shutdown, Cruz added.
FOLDS: It's about unformalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people. People go to the symphony and they think, oh, how do I dress? They don't even know. So, you know, we make it informal in a way for them to feel comfortable to be there.
Facebook also added that it was monitoring for posts calling for protests, even peaceful ones, if they violated the curfew in Washington, D.C., set by Mayor Muriel Bowser. That curfew began at 6 p.m. Wednesday and lifted at 6 a.m. Thursday.

WALLACE: All right. Kellyanne Conway, thank you. Always good to talk with you.
There might be no better way to explain how and why the NBA has changed the travel rules for officials this year than Foster's work schedule to this point. He was scheduled to work a game in Houston on Dec. 23, only to see the matchup called off when the Rockets didn't have enough people available to play in accordance with the league's health and safety protocols regarding the coronavirus.
So perhaps he didn't think it would be such a big deal that he would say Biden should be briefed. After all, Lankford had gently criticized Trump's Lafayette Park Bible brandishing photo-op in June and seemed to have suffered little for the president's rebuke.
How can middle class people survive, without becoming dependent on government? Ah, that's the point. Government acts exactly like a drug dealer, hooking you on government checks for survival, just like drug dealers addict you to cocaine.

The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal, was fatally flawed and one-sided for what was in the agreement, and fatally flawed and one-sided for what was left out.

TRUMP: I am worried about it. Certainly, I am worried about it. Can you imagine, here we are split second timing executed like nobody has seen in many, many years on Soleimani. Can you imagine, they want us to call up and speak to crooked corrupt politician, Adam Schiff. Oh! Adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time. We have a shot at him right now. Could we meet so that we can get your approval Adam Schiff. And he'd say well, let's do it in a couple of days. Oh! OK. Let's meet in a couple - it doesn't work that way. Number one. Number two, they leak. Anything we give will be leaked immediately. You'll see breaking news. We're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something. And by the way, I'm not somebody that wants to attack. I probably could have attacked five times, 10 times having to do with Iran. I've been very guarded because I don't want to do that. But we may have to do something. We have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint. But hopefully it won't be necessary. We have tremendous sanctions. They're doing very poorly. They have riots all over their country and they could straighten out easy. But it's up to them. Whatever they want to be.
It would do a lot to restore public trust in the news industry that all administrations deserve media scrutiny, not just favored ones. The media industry is supposed to be serving as watchdogs for the public of all government officials, not as lapdogs for particular politicians that journalists favor, McCall said.
The Iranian regime has long persecuted Christians, Baha'is and other religious minorities. The recent uptick in repression, specifically targeting Christians and Christian converts, is alarming and unacceptable, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has spoken up for persecuted Christians, told Fox News.

I'm smart enough to know that even though we are playing a game of basketball that there's so much more going on in the world, James said Tuesday after his Los Angeles Lakers beat the Memphis Grizzlies 94-92.

To hear what happened in Kenosha today was a blow to the heart and to the gut, not only to that community, but to us and to every Black person that has been a part of this process, seeing these outcomes for so long.

In a motion to strike, Biden's legal team unconditionally denied the unverified claims, and called the effort by the Florida-based D&A Investigations another obviously bogus scheme by a non-party simply to make scandalous allegations in the pending suit to gain media attention without any material or pertinent material.
In his tweet, Trump linked to an interview of Bolton in August 2019 where he discusses Ukraine policy. In the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty interview clip, Bolton made no mention of any illicit quid pro quo, and acknowledged, as Republicans have claimed, that combating corruption in Ukraine was a high priority for the Trump administration.
GALLAGHER: Politics in California, who would think? So the city filed a restraining order against everyone from the State of California to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to block the transfer of the patients.
So I don't think the president has the authority to do that, and I hope you will continue to try to work with Congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first. This -- the government will reopen when the Republicans in the Senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn't be shutting down the government if they don't get their way.

It could be elements in Afghanistan that are opposed to China, because there are so many different tribes and so many different factions, Chang said. And that, of course, is something we'll eventually get to the bottom of.

The Rev. Johnnie Moore is the president of The Congress of Christian Leaders and a commissioner on the United States Commission for International Religious Freedom.
It is important to remember the original mission in Afghanistan authorized by Congress was to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons. In other words, Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the then Taliban-led government in Afghanistan (because they gave safe haven to bin Laden and al Qaeda.)
Human trafficking is believed to be one of the largest-scale crimes in the world, with 24.9 million people trapped by human traffickers who make more than $150 billion in annual profit for the industry, Ivanka Trump said, adding that there are no demographic limitations to human trafficking, which exploits society's most vulnerable populations like women and children.

TRUMP: No, not at all. By the way, absolutely not at all. We have tremendous support. Look in the House we own 196 to nothing and we got three Democrats. So therefore, it was bipartisan, I guess you could say. We got nothing. They had nothing. We didn't lose one Republican vote. As you know, that's very unusual. In the Senate I think I have the same if not more support, I don't have to do that.

Against the odds he won that election, probably because of that promise, but ever since Washington, including some around the president, have been committed to ignoring the results of that election and its implications. Washington has wanted war with Iran for decades. They've been working toward it. They may have finally gotten it. Douglas Macgregor is a retired U.S. army colonel.

It's the federal no-fly list, a collection of names of people who are not allowed to board commercial flights into or out of the United States. According to leaked documents obtained by The Intercept, more than 47,000 people were on America's no-fly list as of August 2013. That number reportedly includes 800 Americans, many of whom don't even know they're on it. The government sends no official notification to those on the list; many times, people don't find out until they're denied boarding at the airport.

As somebody who is planning to be around for 50-plus years, I'm very worried about the long-term trends in our debt and deficit, Meijer told Fox News.

Dana Loesch: Well, and it's -- yeah. And it's anti-science. You know, when you talk about Castro and Beto O'Rourke and Michael Bloomberg and all of these other individuals that want to circumvent our Second Amendment rights, when they talk about criminal usage, we can't have a conversation about firearms unless we are also including, Tucker, defensive gun usages. These are individuals who are in lawful possession of their firearms. And these numbers – defensive gun usage is, according to the CDC from Barack Obama when he commissioned this in 2013. It has therefore, it's -- I mean, it's been affirmed many times over, as you know, that they vastly outweigh instances of criminal possession. So, why -- my actual fear is that people find this bad, that there are good people out there who take the time to educate themselves, to learn about their firearm and to train, as we saw all those congregants at the church do just a week or so ago with Jack Harris. And then Jack Harris probably trained some of them as well. Now, that's -- people should want to be able, they should be able to defend themselves. And we should encourage and empower people to do so instead of trying to shame them or smear them or malign their character. I find that disturbing.

It's been a diplomatic strategy. It's been an economic strategy. You're now seeing elements of the military strategy. And with respect to targets, President Trump talked about 52 targets last night. That's not new in the following sense: we've made clear to the theocrats and kleptocrats that are running Iran today, running it into the ground against the will of their own people -- we made clear to them that we would not respond just against these proxy forces that they run, in Yemen, and in Syria, and in Iraq, and in Lebanon. We made clear that this cost would be brought home to them, to the leadership regime in Iran, and that we would raise costs. We wouldn't just attack their asymmetric efforts; we would respond in a way that imposes costs on the decision-makers who are putting American lives at risk.

Last year, anti-Trumper Flake met with MSNBC President Phil Griffin and CNN's chief Jeff Zucker, sparking speculation that post-Senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.

The president slammed Pence on Twitter, saying he didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify.
A federal judge last month sentenced Cohen to three years in prison, following a dramatic hearing at which Cohen said he felt it was his duty to cover up Trump's dirty deeds. In August, Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign-finance laws by helping orchestrate payments to silence former Playboy model Karen McDougal and adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed they had sexual encounters with Trump while he was married.

TRUMP: I am, and I was responsible for getting the Olympics. The Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. And I was called by the mayor, and he said, could you do us a favor when I was president-elect. And he said, could you do us, and I worked very hard, and we got the Olympics. And we have the World Cup coming into the United States. And I don't know, I guess you can say no politics, but people are going to talk politics. I think politics -- I do believe I have made politics somewhat more exciting. The New York Times would be dead right now. It would be out of business.

TRUMP: Yes. She hates Israel. She hates Jewish people. You just have to take a look at her rhetoric. It's incredible what's happened to the Democrats in Congress. They used to be supportive of Israel. Today, they're supportive of her and Tlaib. That's another real winner. Tlaib and AOC who knows nothing. AOC knows nothing. Poor student, poor everything and then she comes, and she talks about the Green New Deal and all these poor fools say, isn't it wonderful, isn't it wonderful. But you know as I said last night in Ohio, I don't like talking about the Green New Deal, it's too early. I want to save it for about two weeks before because they may change their mind.

INGRAHAM: The uphill battle that these Democrats face is November isn't because they are not diverse enough. It's because they are not pragmatic enough. Free health care, free college, free preschool, frozen fossil fuel industry, open borders, higher taxes -- it is not going to grow the economy. It's not going to grow your 401(k), your bank account, or whatever, as Jill Biden would say. Empowering governments means taking away power from you. More power for the government means less freedom for you. By the way, it's the same government that thinks wasting millions on dead- end investigations and impeachment is more important than infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices. The 2020 Democrat field of dreams has turned into a mud pit, one that most voters just want to avoid.

WaPo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to quell a rising furor Sunday over whether Democratic lawmakers will seek to impeach President Trump, saying in an interview on CBS News's 'Sunday Morning' that the public has yet to hear the conclusions of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation. Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. … Pelosi's remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who said calls for Trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from Democrats' 'substantive agenda.' … Pelosi's remarks come amid days of Democratic infighting after newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) vowed … to 'impeach the motherf-----,' referring to Trump. Many of Tlaib's colleagues have cautioned against moving too quickly toward impeachment. Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) on Sunday told ABC News that impeaching Trump would be 'an unbelievably serious undertaking.'

Trump campaign moving fast to rig nomination - Politico: President Donald Trump is tightening his iron grip on the Republican Party, launching an elaborate effort to stamp out any vestiges of GOP opposition that might embarrass him at the 2020 Republican convention. The president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. The effort comes as party elites like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney are openly questioning Trump's fitness for the job, and it's meant to ensure that delegates to next year's convention in Charlotte, N.C., are presidential loyalists… Trump political aides Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, the organizers of the project, held a national conference call with Republican state party chairs, who traditionally play an outsize role in picking delegates. Last week, the two advisers began having one-on-one calls with the state chairs to describe the campaign's mission and discuss various circumstances in each state.

South Korea's spy agency said Kim is worrying about U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is to take office on Jan. 20. Biden has called Kim a thug and is unlikely to hold any direct meetings with him unless North Korea takes serious steps toward denuclearization.

INGRAHAM: Iran's Supreme Leader -- I don't like saying that, but I said it -- today, made a rare appearance in public to call Trump a clown who can't be trusted, and praised the missile strikes against U.S. forces. The comments came two weeks after President Trump ordered that killing of Qasem Soleimani via air strike, and in the days since, of course, Democrats and the media have sworn up and down that this was ill-advised and had only united Iran. Is that really the case? We recently spoke to Iranian-American activist Erica Kasraie, whose viral video explaining how actual Iranian citizens feel has amassed nearly 5.6 million views. We started by asking her to respond to this from some in the media.

CARLSON: Most of what you're saying is intuitive. It's obvious. Normal people, I think, know it instinctively. So why the change? Was there a groundswell of support for letting people out of prison or not putting them in prison for killing police animals, for example, or rape? I mean, how did we get here?

HEMINGWAY: And people really should be skeptical when they are told things. The previous two presidents had problems trusting intelligence that they shouldn't have trusted. You can never get mad at people for asking to the goods on intelligence or being skeptical that another president will embroil us in a war in the Middle East. But yes, you need to check your facts, and you need to not fall for conspiracy theories and whatnot. And that's not happening.
Chris Wallace: President Trump says that General Soleimani was planning a imminent attack against Americans. You have said it was a big action that could potentially kill hundreds of American diplomats and soldiers. What was the plan? Who were the targets? And how soon?
CARLSON: Dr. Marc Siegel for us in Omaha tonight. Thanks so much for that.
He actually listened and heard from the experts, from the folks on the border, on the frontlines of America's borders every single day, who are risking and sacrificing so much, he said. He didn't just hear them, he listened to them, he spent time with them, traveled down to the border, learned about the border, heard from them.

You know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.
Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley on Friday reacted to the permanent suspension of President Trump's Twitter account, describing it as an instance of silencing of the kind that happens in communist China.
JORDAN: There was a basis for my concern about the spying that happened. And then, third -- or, fourth, I should say, he used a term that should scare us all. He used the term political surveillance when he testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee. That's scary. And the fact that he is doing such a good job in getting to the bottom of this, that's what scares them. I look forward to the Durham report when it comes out later this year.
After nine long months, the families who lost their loved ones in nursing homes deserve full transparency and accountability. Unless we can review an accurate number of nursing home residents, we can never fully understand how we failed to protect them.

But make no mistake about it: Despite receiving widespread positive attention from many in the press, Ocasio-Cortez's radical left-wing policy proposals and her socialist ideology present a significant threat to America's economy and its longstanding commitment to individual liberty. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't simply want to tweak our existing system, she wants to complete Barack Obama's goal of fundamentally transforming the United States of America.
McCain then brought up Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and the freshman House member's appearance on Tuesday's Rachel Maddow Show broadcast following Trump's address, saying the 29-year-old congresswoman was basically demonizing border agents and ICE. (ICE is the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.)

During Romney's Senate campaign he dropped his harsh criticism of President Trump and denied that he had been a leader of the Never Trump movement. Romney indicated in an October 2018 speech that although he has had some differences with the president, he was generally supportive of him and thought Mr. Trump had been pretty effective.
Fox News' John Roberts and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.
The contrast should be glaring for anyone who watched. The president was really sober -- he genuinely believes that a wall is needed as part of a larger border security policy. That's what he won on. Democrats don't give a damn about securing the border. For them this is all about scoring political points and of course, 2020.

The larger point here, Chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between Democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. Far from it. All of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. And the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the Senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.

Nothing for the wall, Pelosi said in an interview with NBC's Today show set to air Thursday. We can go through the back and forth. No. How many more times can we say no?

I don't think Mitt Romney's going to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. That's just my instinct. I do think John Kasich might. I think Jeff Flake might. And a lot will depend on the Mueller report. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and once we get that, I think you'll see some Republicans make some decisions about that primary.
After his defeat in 2012 and in the run-up to the next election, Romney made the rounds of important Republican funders, looking to test their support for a re-run. I spoke to some of those folks as the 2016 contest got underway. The near-universal consensus: he had had his shot.

LEE SMITH, AUTHOR, PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT: Qassem Soleimani was in many ways the cornerstone of the nuclear agreement that they made in July 2015.

He really was the cornerstone of the deal in many ways.

Two things about big congressional classes. They are so massive that inevitably some new Members will commit what are regarded as amateur mistakes. Some are just stumbles. Others are glaring errors. Some major scandals. That was certainly the case with big classes welcomed to Washington following major political upheaval in 1974, 1994, 2006, 2008 and 2010. You never quite know who might step in it. But the classes are so large that the odds of a freshman miscue grow geometrically.

Historically, walls were used to keep invaders out. The early Chinese states built what has become known as the Great Wall to protect themselves against the nomadic groups of the Steppes. Roman Emperor Hadrian constructed a wall across the British isle separating the Roman domain from troublesome northern tribes. More recently, Israel has employed several walls—along the West Bank and Gaza, as well as along its northern and southern borders, to protect itself from terrorism, smuggling, illegal immigration and other threats.

Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to enacting democratic socialism is evident in many of her policy proposals, especially her plan for a Green New Deal. According to a draft resolution produced by Ocasio-Cortez to create a House climate change committee, the Green New Deal would eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in the United States by 2030 and instead force consumers to buy 100 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cost as much as five times more than existing fossil-fuel-power generation, and to purchase electric cars.

What are your thoughts? Put on your thinking caps and let me see those questions!
Chris Wallace: Josh, I want to move to a different aspect of the questions that people are asking this week. President Trump very publicly and has reaffirmed it as recently as this fall that the situation in Syria ran on getting the U.S. out of endless wars in the Middle East. But as I discussed with Secretary Pompeo, this week alone he sent more than 4,000 U.S. troops into the region. So, are we getting out? Are we getting deeper?

This billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that Michael Bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at Woodstock when he was a teenager.

The public outrage at Guillén's murder forced an independent review of the base, led by a five-member civilian team. The findings found a deficient climate at Fort Hood, as well as an ineffective implementation of the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) program that resulted in a pervasive lack of confidence, fear of retaliation, and significant underreporting of cases, particularly within the enlisted ranks.
On Thursday, sailors discovered a limpet mine on a tanker in the Persian Gulf off Iraq near the Iranian border as it prepared to transfer fuel to another tanker owned by a company traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

Top officials leave over Trump misconduct - Fox News: With just two weeks left before the Trump administration vacates Washington D.C., some staffers are resigning in protest after demonstrations breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by protesters following a speech by President Trump. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, East Wing Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, and Social Secretary Rickie Niceta all submitted their resignations after pro-Trump supporters mobbed the U.S. Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. Late Thursday morning, a senior administration official told Fox News that Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, resigned Wednesday afternoon as a result of the president's actions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mick Mulvaney -- special envoy to Northern Ireland and President Trump's former chief of staff -- on Thursday also resigned, telling CNBC: 'I can't stay here.'

President Trump decided that the answer was an emphatic no.
It's unclear when and if any of them will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years, and reflects a shift in the party itself. A stunning Gallup poll last summer showed Democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism. The term Democratic Socialist was only broadly popularized with the 2016 presidential run of Bernie Sanders, who identifies as one. The enthusiasm behind his bid underscored how ideas that once marinated on the party's fringe were increasingly becoming mainstream.
The Trump administration recognizes that el-Sissi is a friend of the United States and should be treated as such. But unfortunately, he has been unfairly demonized in much of the U.S. media and by the left.

He was a bad actor, had been for a couple of decades, but the question is whether this was the smartest way in which to conduct an overall foreign policy in the region and whether -- and I believe it has actually made the region and the United States interests a lot more vulnerable.
A draft text of the plan circulating Congress includes a framework aimed at eliminating greenhouse gas emission from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.

Aside from excusing the conduct of the vandals and rioters, it suggests somehow that the case for America is hopeless.

Officials are concerned the sika deer could carry chronic wasting disease, a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

There's no chain of command of the notes as you have to do in a - in a typical legal setting to authentic that they were written at a certain time and they meant a certain thing. There's an entire process to go through regarding such types of evidence and by the way, the foreign minister of Ukraine had this to say Ari, about Parnas.

President Trump decided that the status quo was unacceptable. He was and is correct. Now, I want to say it's very important. You know my views on these endless wars.

I think that he will, though, be on the VP shortlist, even if he really doesn't deserve to be, but his name will be on the list.
Graham continued: It is clear to me that there is ample evidence for the President to be concerned about conflicts of interest on behalf of Hunter Biden and that Vice President Joe Biden's failure to take appropriate action was unacceptable. This combination, in my view, undercut America's message on reforming corruption in Ukraine. There is a mountain of evidence to suggest the Bidens' behavior was harmful to the United States. The House managers' claim that the sole reason President Trump temporarily paused the aid was purely personal and political, not public, does not withstand scrutiny.
We don't know what an Obama Democrat really is since his rise was a singular phenomenon rather than a movement. It may be only now, without the presence of his longtime rival, Hillary Clinton, that the Democrats get down to defining what that means.

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, who previously said the commission shouldn't be responsible for creating weapons policies, said last week that he would support an open carry ban after violence erupted at the U.S. Capitol by a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters.
He never was able to get a foothold. And the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized.

The notion of political retribution is hardly theoretical. Trump undoubtedly helped defeat Jeff Sessions, the first senator to endorse him in 2016, in November after his acrimonious departure as attorney general.

I mean they're not going to do till after impeachment but these are questions that we've been asking and Ari, by the way Democrat Senator Jeff Merkley things anyone to bias to be a juror should step aside.
The commander in chief said audits of Pentagon war spending must be private — an apparent reference to reports produced by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. Trump asserted that the reports give away too much information and should not be publicly released, although the law that created that watchdog's office says its reports must be made public.
CRUZ: Well, Maria, you're right. And the Democrats desperately want to keep that topic off the news. And, sadly, an awful lot of folks in the media are very compliant with that. But that's why I said this week the president having the opportunity to defend himself is so important, because I think one of the fundamental defenses that I expect to hear from the White House this week is that the president has inherent authority and, in fact, a responsibility to investigate corruption. And when you look at what happened with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, there is, at a minimum, prima facie evidence of corruption. You have got Hunter Biden getting paid $83,000 a month by Burisma, the largest natural gas company in Ukraine; $83,000 a month is a million dollars a year.
NAVARRO: Yes, I am. The problem is what's going on in the rest of the world and how these vectors are going to impact us. But the issue here is to be ready, be prepared.

The larger point here, Chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between Democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. Far from it. All of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. And the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the Senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.
Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Trump has remained stalled for nearly two years because of disputes over U.S.-led sanctions.
TRUMP: Well, a couple of people started that, and they got hit real fast by a lot of different people, not me. I think it's just low life. Look, he's not going anywhere. He was a lousy mayor of a place that is not doing well, and Indiana is doing unbelievably. Indiana, the state had the best year they've ever had. Thank you very much. But that city was badly run.

The GOP's 53-member majority can weather several defections in the Senate, and Trump has threatened to use his veto power to defeat any legislation to reopen the government without wall funding. But the indications on Wednesday that some Republicans are increasingly wary of the shutdown, which Trump has said could last for years, highlighted the potential political pitfalls of leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or without pay. (Some 380,000 are furloughed, and approximately 420,000 are working without pay.)

BLACKBURN: Good to be with you. Thank you.
Senator Graham, thank you. Thanks for your time.
Sen. Cornyn: Well, I'm I am a little surprised because I agree with you. I think ordinarily Speaker Pelosi is a pretty shrewd political tactician. But I think here she got forced to do something she did not want to do in the first place, which was to proceed with the impeachment. You may recall her comments back in March of 2019, where she said only if it was bipartisan and the case compelling would it be worn. The divisiveness that would necessarily arise out of an impeachment proceeding. And then she proceeded after that. Months after that to basically cave in to the demands of the most radical members of her own party. I think that's what happened here. And now she's finds herself in a a bit of a box canyon. And it's not clear exactly how she gets out of this unless, of course, Senator McConnell succumbs, which I know he will not do to the entreaties of Senator Schumer to recreate the circus like atmosphere in the House, in the Senate. We're not going to do that. We will take it seriously. We will perform our constitutional responsibilities. But I think this is a box that. Speaker Pelosi has gotten herself in, and it's going to be fascinating to see how she gets out of it.

Meanwhile, in the House, there was limited GOP support on Wednesday for Democrats' spending bill agenda as well.

HUCKABEE: It's just the absurdity of what we are dealing with. Some people eat their soup louder than others. It doesn't mean their soup tastes better. Some people are very expressive in their faith, others are very reserved. But the point is, if Donald Trump is a part of anything that is spiritual or the evangelicals are around him, it's cult-like. But if it happens with Biden, it's just a wonderful expression of an affirmation of a faith that he doesn't practice very well because he is supposedly to be a Catholic, but he's yet pro-abortion. That's a hard one to reconcile.

Is it when the state commits mass human rights violations against its own citizens? The Iranian regime checks all boxes.

GRAHAM: The plan is to do a deal. He is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status.
Conventional wisdom holds that Republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are Democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. Yes, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 Republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. Of the 15 Democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, were former governors.

Rookie lawmakers also have a steep learning curve for how the institution works. What's the difference between a bill and a resolution? A bill can actually become law. Most resolutions aren't binding. What is the difference between the budget and appropriations? Budgets are broad, fiscal blueprints lacking the force of law. Budgets encompass how much money the federal government spends each year. Appropriations are live ammo. Congress dictates appropriations to fund the 12 annual spending bills and run the government each year. There's also the difference between discretionary and mandatory spending. Discretionary spending is another word for an appropriation. In other words, Congress wields discretion over spending that money or not. Mandatory spending is on automatic pilot. Entitlements, like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Congress doesn't allot an annual appropriation for these programs. Thus, that spending is mandatory.
According to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.
President Trump's hour-long argument with Raffensperger alleging voter fraud in the presidential race in Georgia further weakened Republican voter enthusiasm, as people couldn't figure out what was going on or who to believe.

Enjoy a brief excerpt from a piece by the New Yorker's Jake Halpern about the skilled climber and thief referred to as Spider-Man by the French press. New Yorker: Long before the burglar Vjeran Tomic became the talk of Paris, he honed his skills in a graveyard. … At the age of ten, Tomic pulled off his first heist. He broke into a library in Mostar, climbing through a window that was nearly ten feet above street level. He stole two books, each of which appeared to be several hundred years old. … Tomic said of his early criminal adventures, 'It was intuitive. Nobody ever taught me anything.' … In time, Tomic began robbing apartments in more affluent neighborhoods. His climbing skills continued to improve, and by the age of sixteen he could scale the façade of a multistory building with relative ease. … One night, he had a vivid dream in which he stole five paintings from a museum. He took it as a portent. As he wrote to me, 'I knew that someday I would do something great.'

Graham continued: It is clear to me that there is ample evidence for the President to be concerned about conflicts of interest on behalf of Hunter Biden and that Vice President Joe Biden's failure to take appropriate action was unacceptable. This combination, in my view, undercut America's message on reforming corruption in Ukraine. There is a mountain of evidence to suggest the Bidens' behavior was harmful to the United States. The House managers' claim that the sole reason President Trump temporarily paused the aid was purely personal and political, not public, does not withstand scrutiny.
The Democrats want this shutdown to go on as long as possible to divide as many Republicans from the president as they can. They want to peel off one after another and ratchet up the political pressure -- our safety and security be damned.

Trump repeats claims that drove mob in response to certification - Fox News: President Trump promised an 'orderly transition' on Jan. 20 after Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory. The certification came after a day in Washington, D.C., that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from Trump on Twitter that called for calm in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,' the statement read.

Sen. Cornyn: Yeah, well, you would think that that Senate Democrats who negotiated a procedural arrangement for the President Clinton impeachment, that they would be satisfied with that same arrangement being used in the impeachment trial of President Trump. But they're not. And they're asking for more. As we've discussed and I think they know how this ends, because it's going to take 67 votes to convict and remove President Trump. And they're doing all of this less than a year, about 11 months until the next general election. I think it's it's really backfiring on them. They know it is. And they're they're desperate to try to find a way out. But so far, they haven't figured it out.

While I cannot comment on the specifics of the New York Times report, I can say that counterintelligence concerns about those associated with the Trump campaign, including the President himself, have been at the heart of our investigation since the beginning, his statement said. Those concerns have not been alleviated by the Committee's work over the last two years; to the contrary, the abundance of meetings, contacts, and communications between Trump associates and the Russians, and the web of lies about those interactions, and the President's own statements and actions, have only heightened our need to follow the evidence wherever it may lead.

But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.

Most journalists are celebrating the Twitter ban (and the indeterminate Facebook ban) as an unalloyed triumph over a president they have been battling for four years. To even raise a question about it, as I have learned, is to be yelled at as defending someone who incited a terrorist attack.

And I think Secretary Pompeo and Trump realize that and yet they know that our real interests are in China with - in dealing with China and there's existential threat. So, they're sort of like sheriff's backing out of this Middle East saloon and saying, this place is a mess, but we're going to have a revolved result and restore deterrence. And that's hard to do.

He was a bad actor, had been for a couple of decades, but the question is whether this was the smartest way in which to conduct an overall foreign policy in the region and whether -- and I believe it has actually made the region and the United States interests a lot more vulnerable.

Over the last several years, we have allowed President Trump to use our platform consistent with our own rules, at times removing content or labeling his posts when they violate our policies, he continued. We did this because we believe that the public has a right to the broadest possible access to political speech, even controversial speech.
Since then, the Trump administration has brokered peace agreements between Israel and several Arab nations, all of whom recognize Iran as a threat in the region.

INGRAHAM: She have stuff to do. Let me say, we have a lot of stuff that needs to be done in this country. We have infrastructure that's crumbling. Go to any major airport compared to a lot of airports in Europe and Asia, it's ridiculous and they're messing around with these ridiculous investigations.

TRUMP LAMENTS 'CRISIS OF THE HEART AND A CRISIS OF THE SOUL' AT BORDER
Rogozin, a nationalist politician who was sanctioned in 2014 by the EU, Canada and former U.S. President Barack Obama for his role in promoting the destabilization in Crimea when he was deputy prime minister, had been slated to visit America but NASA said Friday it was rescinding his invitation after complaints from U.S. lawmakers.
In 2021, travelers will feel safer spending time outdoors compared to enclosed spaces when it comes to being in public. Whether it's meeting and event space, outdoor dining, or inviting green spaces for socially distant coffee breaks or yoga sessions, more and more properties will be looking to incorporate the outdoors into the guest experience.
While all eyes were understandably on impeachment, Mitch McConnell's conveyor belt churned out a shocking number of judges this week in what remains the most underrated story of the Trump era,″ said Christopher Kang, chief counsel at liberal advocacy group Demand Justice.
I personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. What I think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the Trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. The humanitarian crisis I think may have been what she was referring to.
The president also signed an executive order Friday that will establish a one-stop-shop website for the public to be able to go and see all of the federal government's resources on human trafficking, as well as improved methodologies to determine prevalence in the United States.

This means that the account of @RealDonaldTrump will be locked for 12 hours following the removal of these tweets, Twitter posted. If the Tweets are not removed, the account will remain locked.
Chris Wallace: And it's time now for our Sunday group. Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and former Trump national security council spokesperson, Michael Anton. Michael, does the decision to escalate dramatically and I think we would agree it was a dramatic escalation to take out Qassem Soleimani, does it make the U.S. more safe or less safe and if Iran decides as -- keeps its promise to retaliate dramatically, does the Trump administration have a strategy?
LANKSTON: So they have technically paid for these amazing refurbishments.
To realize how fumbled the current vaccine rollout is, we can look to back to 1947, when a single case of smallpox in New York City led to a mass vaccination program of 6 million people in less than a month, using glass syringes as opposed to modern techniques.

President Trump's lawyers could make a motion to dismiss or one of the senators could make a motion to dismiss and take a vote right away. Whether they decide to do that or not will be up obviously to the members of the Senate, maybe to the Chief Justice initially. But I have absolutely no doubt that the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power which every president since Adams has been accused of, by their political opponents and obstruction of Congress, which is another way of saying, the President exercised separation of powers and checks and balances in an entirely proper way should never come to actual trial.
It really comes down to terms of service, Toscano said. If any of us, individually, did the stuff that Trump has done, we would also be banned. It's an agreement that we all made when we signed up for the platform. Are those rules overbearing? Do they need to be critiqued and changed in the future? Possibly. That's more of a Section 230 conversation… we need to have a bigger conversation, as a society, about whether that's right that a company that large has this much power over the government.
Mike Pompeo: I don't. I think that our adversaries understand that President Trump and our administration will do the right thing to protect American people, every place that we find risk.
President Trump now says the government shutdown could go on for months or even years. With the standoff over the border wall now in its third week, White House officials and congressional staffers met Saturday to work towards a deal, but prospects for a breakthrough remain dim as the new Democratic majority in the House seems determined to stand up to President Trump.

It is important to remember the original mission in Afghanistan authorized by Congress was to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons. In other words, Usama bin Laden, al Qaeda, and the then Taliban-led government in Afghanistan (because they gave safe haven to bin Laden and al Qaeda.)
ALDA: There it is. There it is.
The points of contention appear to me about much than just talking points, however. The Taliban doesn't want representatives of the existing Afghan government puppets to be there, and prefer to speak directly to U.S officials. But there's frustration as well with the U.S, which would free only 3,000 of the 25,000 Taliban prisoners the group wants released.

I think now we have proof that Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, all these companies in making this move, feel that they are responsible for the content on their platform, which then drives the conversation into Section 230, Toscano said. That's the whole argument of Section 230, right? They all argue that they shouldn't be held accountable for the content on their platform. Well, they just made a huge statement that they do feel accountable.

The drawback to formal American recognition of Israeli sovereignty on the Golan, however, is that it is an issue that has been entirely non-controversial, unlike Israel's presence in the West Bank. Israel can easily maintain the status quo on the Golan without any U.S. recognition whatsoever, but American recognition runs the risk of turning what has been a quiet issue into one that all of a sudden becomes controversial once the spotlight is shone on it, he added. It may end up swapping a security win for a public relations win, which is particularly dangerous now given the heightened importance of keeping the Golan quiet as the Syrian endgame includes a permanent Iranian presence across the Israeli border.

No matter their original purpose, some basic principles behind walls remain timeless. Walls do work, at least for a time. There is a reason, after all, why states across the centuries have turned to walls as solutions to strategic quagmires. As mentioned before, walls have proven notably effective in places like Iraq in tamping down violence. That said, walls also have a shelf-life. In military parlance, walls are delaying obstacles. They can slow down the attacker and in best-case scenarios deter them from attacking in the first place by making the effort not worth the reward. But no historical wall has proven impregnable. Determined adversaries have been able to breach them or tunnel under them in time. Despite Israel's technological edge, Hamas has infiltrated under the walls around Gaza. North Korea was able to tunnel into the demilitarized zone toward South Korea, despite it being one of the most fortified areas of the world.
It seems like everyone is moving forward, Garner said.

Iranian leaders don't want to reenter the JCPOA as it is for their love of humanity. They want to reenter the JCPOA as it is because they rolled U.S. negotiators at the table to secure this agreement in 2015, and then made out like bandits with the sanctions relief. The current nuclear deal would allow Iran to continue its other non-nuclear hostile activities, and still have nuclear weapons in short order.

Travel outside the island became less restrictive, and some of the government's most vocal critics, including Guillermo Farinas and Yoani Sanchez, were allowed to travel abroad – where they firmly assailed the island's political leaders in speeches and media interviews -- and return to Cuba.

Dershowitz responded by claiming that the GAO didn't have the jurisdiction to claim that Trump engaged in criminal behavior, something he said the agency didn't claim anyway. He also added that the GAO was also wrong, noting that the president had the right to withhold funds as part of his authority to conduct foreign policy.

Be best: Biden tells friends nobody in Dem field can top him - NYT: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in the final stages of deciding whether to run for president and has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat President Trump, an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. Many Democratic voters, and nearly all major Democratic donors, are keenly interested in Mr. Biden's plans because of their consuming focus on finding a candidate who can beat a president they believe represents a threat to American democracy. But there is also a rising demand in the party for a more progressive standard-bearer who reflects the increasingly diverse Democratic coalition. Mr. Biden would instantly be the early front-runner if he ran, but he would have to bridge divides in a primary…

REP. LEE ZELDIN, R-N.Y.: A lot of miscalculation.

The statement describes how Thursday's meeting was not a resolution to the problematic issues that led to the February 2019 raid but noted: there could be no resolution without first engaging in a substantive conversation.
If the polling is an accurate portrait, likely an 'exasperation factor' contributed to the increase in those supporting the 'embargo,' said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, Inc., in New York. From December, 2014 through November, 2016, there was an expectation, perhaps more of a rational hope, that the Obama administration changes to the bilateral commercial, economic and political relationship with the Republic of Cuba would continue through [a Hillary] Clinton administration. That was faulty thinking because of the outcome of the election.

Chris Van Hollen: So, look, there's no doubt that the maximum pressure campaign is putting pressure on Iran, but to what end? Secretary Pompeo had a list of, like, 11 things the Iranian regime had to do, and it was never realistic, and that's why they've got no endgame. And that's why we're here right now, after this latest escalation, at much greater risk of going to war with Iran, which would be very damaging to the United States. Obviously, it would be damaging to Iran, but it would be very damaging to the United States.

Don't focus on what Democrats say. Watch what they do. The Democrats want this shutdown to go on as long as possible to divide as many Republicans from the president as they can. They want to peel off one after another and ratchet up the political pressure -- our safety and security be damned.
Finally, there is the failure to address or clean up the allegations of a corrupt election process that arose from the Nov. 3 election. This failure is the most amazing thing I have seen in six decades of Republican politics. Despite serious concerns from many Georgians, Gov. Kemp and Secretary of State Raffensperger took the position that everything was fine — or simply unfixable. This did nothing to increase public trust or credibility.

On Dec. 20, Chinese Rear Adm.

When that has happened, Admiral Lou announced, then we'll see how frightened America is.

A peace process between the Colombian government and rebels had the unintended result of spawning more land use for the production of coca leaf, as the previous president stopped aerial fumigation meant to destroy coca crops.

So here's the question: I understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of Democrats, including Pelosi, including Schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. So why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that Lindsey Graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on Dreamers and on TPS immigrants?
Katie Waldman, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, said: Once again we have had a violent mob of migrants attempt to enter the United States illegally by attacking our agents with projectiles. As has happened before - in this and previous administrations -- our personnel used the minimum force necessary to defend themselves, defend our border, and restore order. The agents involved should be applauded for handling the situation with no reported injuries to the attackers.

As with issues like immigration and trade, on the Iran situation, President Trump has been forced to clean up the messes created by previous two administrations. Now post 9/11, George W. Bush thought that once we invaded Iraq, WMD or no WMD, once we kill Saddam Hussein and then disbanded the Iraqi military. Well, democratic institutions would eventually take flower. Well, that was a colossal and cruel joke.

Washington is literally at a standstill over the funding for a wall on the United States southern border. Putting aside the politics behind the gridlock for the moment, the substance of the debate hinges less on the need for border security and more on differing claims about the effectiveness of such a wall. President Trump has claimed a wall would be 99.9 percent effective at stopping illegal immigration while leading Democrats argue a border wall is unnecessary and would be ineffective. And so it may be worth stepping back from the politics of the day to view walls in their historical context. After all, states have been building walls since ancient times. Some were arguably quite successful, others less so. At the core of prudent policy lies a basic question: What can walls realistically accomplish?

But now, as Romney struts in with his smug rehab as the nation's moral arbiter, a more complete picture of the politician is warranted.

The unprecedented attack on the Capitol, which was seemingly encouraged by Trump, comes as the soon-to-be former president has vowed to remain influential in GOP party politics after he leaves the White House and as he's pledged to support primary challenges in the 2022 midterm elections to Republican governors and senators who refused to aid his efforts to stay in power.

DINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: I think you are quite right that they began with a diversity parade. You have two groups of people, the ones claiming to be diverse, Buttigieg, I'm gay, Cory Booker, I'm black, Kamala Harris, I'm black and a woman, so I'm a twofer. And then the other candidates like Elizabeth Warren and others, Beto, aspiring to be diverse, and pretending to be diverse in ways that they were not. So it was a diversity parade and a diversity charade.

But then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. And Nancy Pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides Republicans, that peels off Republicans. And the one thing that will keep Republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the Mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. If it just becomes -- if the Democratic Party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the Republican Party, which I think is a real concern, of just the anti-Trump party, than that will unify the Republicans.

You take a couple pictures with somebody, if someone's a donor. They get in line. They sit at a dinner with 50 people. And that's how it works. The media then takes it, oh, they're buddies. I guarantee you, my father couldn't pick this guy out of a lineup. That doesn't mean he hasn't taken pictures with him.

The subject of emotional support and service animals on airplanes was a major travel news topic of 2018, after an emotional support peacock named Dexter and his owner were denied boarding on a United Airlines flight.

Danon: We know that sanctions are very effective. We have nothing against the Iranian people, but the regime has threatened to do something against the U.S., against Israel. We hope the U.S. will continue to lead and get more European countries that will join. Then we can actually talk about changing the agreement. That's the only way to do it. Some of the European countries that have signatures on the JCPOA they acknowledge that the Iranians are breaching the agreement and seeing if it's feasible for them to support more sanctions and a tougher approach regarding Iran.

That happens in countries, too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule.

Tucker Carlson: Well, if you can remember that far back during President Barack Obama's second term, Republican leaders in the Congress made a big show of opposing the Obama administration's refugee policy. Obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled Syria's civil war in the United States and at the time 25 Republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. Now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. For example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. Often, it's impossible. Some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be Syrian. That was true for sure in Europe with the refugees. Some of them might be Islamic extremists. But terrorism was not the only worry they had. America's middle class is in decline. We already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. The last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. That's just true. And anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. As with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. So, before she became the most anti-American member of Congress, Ilhan Omar was a refugee. So, at the time the Republican governors got their wish and President Trump won the 2016 election.

If some of those guys don't want to hear from the witnesses that we'd want to hear from, but we will hear from the others, I want to know about it, because they don't deserve to be in office. So it really depends. We have to play the game the way the Democrats have played the game. We have to play hard, but fair. Hearing from everyone is totally fair.

As is, this deal is not a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Instead, it is a blueprint for exactly how Iran can secure massive sums of money and get its hands on a nuclear weapon in short order.
The very nature of the national security law is as a draconian blanket law allowing the government to arrest and potentially imprison people for long terms for exercising their constitutionally protected rights, Wang said.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I think it's entirely likely that his testimony would be helpful to the president, because it would identify basically a foreign policy dispute which is reserved to the president under the Constitution, is really his sole authority as a as a basis for impeachment for this. Now, the third time in American history. So he could. It could well be beneficial. And as to the second count, which is obstruction, you'll recall that the Adam Schiff did say he was wanted to subpoena Ambassador Bolton. But when Ambassador Bolton said he wanted a court to instruct him whether to comply with the subpoena or whether to invoke executive privilege, as the White House had insisted that he'd look to the court for guidance and Adam Schiff dropped it like a hot potato. So I don't know how this would come out the way I read the ambassador's offer. He didn't say what he was testimony would be, but he would respond to the subpoena. And I would expect anyone who was subpoenaed by the vote of 51 senators to respond. But what their testimony actually turns out to be, that's another matter.

Together, Ocasio-Cortez's proposals would effectively eliminate fossil fuels from most of society, destroy millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of wealth, require 'upgrading' every home and business in America, create a national federal jobs-guarantee program, impose single-payer health care (costing trillions more), establish a new system of publicly owned banks, run up the national debt by countless trillions of dollars, and move the United States closer than ever to socialism, Justin Haskins, a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News.

It's been a couple of days since now-Senator Mitt Romney's petty and divisive Washington Post op-ed smearing President Trump.

This one may be obvious, but of course known terrorists end up on the no-fly list. The man who tried to bomb a Northwest Airlines flight in 2009 and the man convicted of planting a car bomb in Times Square in 2010 both were on the no-fly list (they were able to board planes anyway). Last year, the Intercept obtained a secret document issued by the National Counterterrorism Center that details how the government puts people on the no-fly list as well as on terrorist databases. It lists people convicted of or arrested for acts of terrorism, bombers, hostage takers, assassins, associates of terror groups, and others. According to the document, federal agencies can nominate someone for a government blacklist if an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.

And I think it's legitimate for Speaker Pelosi to actually keep open this process as long as she needs to. I mean, she's going to turn over the articles of impeachment, but she does want assurances, given that McConnell came out straightforwardly and said he wasn't going to have a fair process and that he was coordinating with the president. And so, you know, and I think that she actually has created leverage, because, in fact, she opened up the space for Murkowski and Collins. And I'm waiting for this phase -- for Mitt Romney, who stands nothing to gain in this process by aligning himself with the administration, with the president -- to make sure that there is, indeed, a fair process.

Finally, there is the failure to address or clean up the allegations of a corrupt election process that arose from the Nov. 3 election. This failure is the most amazing thing I have seen in six decades of Republican politics. Despite serious concerns from many Georgians, Gov.

Pence, before the joint session of Congress began, said he did not believe, under the Constitution, that he had the authority to unilaterally accept or reject electoral votes.
When House Democratic impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., claimed all scholars except for Dershowitz agreed that impeachment didn't have to involve crimes or criminal-like conduct, there were audible groans from the GOP side of the chamber.
In fact, rules like the safe harbor provision that helped conscientious lawmakers, officials and judges get to this point despite unprecedented efforts to subvert the results are the product of a law passed in the wake of the 1876 nightmare to prevent a repeat.
So, Vince, how does he handle that? Because he could end up sounding an awful lot like the president talking about Wall Street.

The president's account was temporarily suspended after posting a video telling protesters who stormed the Capitol Building, erupting in violent protests which led to multiple deaths, to go home while maintaining that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the most diverse field for a nomination ever.
We then learned through Comey's congressional testimony that he decided to take it upon himself to clear Hillary Clinton on her email controversy, and that the memo clearing her was drafted months in advance of much of the actual investigating. Once he believed the attorney general was compromised, as he testified, he should have asked for an independent counsel. Instead he exceeded his role and authority, politicizing the FBI in the process.
ROVE: WE can stay stuck in this and we can argue about Nancy Pelosi saying it's an immoral wall, which she voted for the wall last year and did not declare when -- when Barack Obama wrote -- built 133 miles of wall that that was immoral.
Even with those relatively permissive standards, 35 people is a huge field. It is a result of not only a pretty considerable amount of talent on the Democratic bench but also the fact that the Democrats believe President Trump is eminently beatable in 2020.
Although Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn has a good idea: just recuse yourselves. Tweeting that the senators are, quote, spending millions of dollars to defeat Donald Trump and we are supposed to believe they will be impartial during this trial? They should recuse themselves.

SANDERS: Absolutely, the president means what he says when he says that. But it would be outrageous for Democrats who agree with the president -- that's what's the most outrageous thing to me, and something that frankly is so just incomprehensible -- they agree with the president. They agree that we need border security. They just are unwilling to let this president win.

INGRAHAM: Well, the Clinton impeachment resolution included a provision for a motion to dismiss before the witness vote took place. Now it ultimately failed but it was an important point.

Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that.

Rainey told the AP that she led 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom, which describes itself online as a nonpartisan network promoting conservative values, to Washington to stand against election fraud and support President Trump. She said the group attended the Save America Rally near the Ellipse by the White House, but she wasn't aware that anyone in her group had entered the Capitol. She said they were headed back to their buses hours before an emergency curfew took effect.

You've got Bernie Sanders over here on the left and with Elizabeth Warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path.

Lankford was unlucky, this time, though.

CORKE: From the Situation Room, Rose Garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to Congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.
Nearly 15 percent of children ranging from ages 6 to 19 are obese, according to the American Obesity Association. Nationally, nine out of 10 public schools sold soda, chips and candy in school year 2003-2004, according to the Government Accountability Office.

I was really surprised at how little impact descriptions of Warnock's radicalism had on voters who normally would have been appalled at some of his positions. Because of polarization they had picked their team and they resented, rather than listened to, negative information about their side.

JORDAN: Yes. And one of them even -- one of the FBI agents even said they didn't think he was lying at the time. But they later then said that he -- that he did. Yes, they tried to set him up. They did set him up. But this is not unusual, because -- well, it should be unusual, but the FBI did it another time as well. They did it on January 6 at Trump Tower, when it was president-elect Trump. They went up there and briefed president-elect Trump on the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false. They went and briefed the president on it, so they could go then leak it to the press, and the press could write about it. And they tried to set up the president-elect of the United States in the same manner. So this is how they operate. And they got caught. Think about what Mr. Horowitz told us last month, Maria. He told us that the FBI, when they went to get the Carter Page warrant to spy on the Trump campaign, they lied to the court 17 times in the initial application and the three renewals; 17 times, they lied to the court. And now what's interesting, is Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, the two individuals who were in charge of that investigation, got in a little spat now with Rod Rosenstein, who was also involved.

In at least a partial nod to the presumably mammoth cost that overhauling the nation's economy and energy sector would entail, it says that the financing of the Plan would be accomplished by the federal government, using a combination of the Federal Reserve, a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate, in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the Plan will be returned to the treasury, reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment.
The point about these debates on free speech and political retaliation is that things look very different when the target is people on your side. I fully believe in accountability for those associated with last week's appalling attack on American democracy. But there's the potential for an awful lot of collateral damage here.
Ocasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States.

On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.

After a provocative run of weapons tests in 2016-17, Kim abruptly launched high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Trump. He also met Chinese, Russian, South Korean and other world leaders.

Tucker Carlson: We don't know where the situation with Iran is going but we can be certain that if it breaks into a full-blown war a few things will be true. It will likely cost much more than they tell you, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars. At the end America's likely to be weaker than it was in the beginning and we know this for certain, our biggest rival will be stronger. Who's our biggest rival? It's not Iran, despite what they tell you in Washington. It is needless to say, China. Well, we're continuing to squander money and blood in Baghdad and many other capitals in that region. China is growing its economy at home even as it expands its reach throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, even the heartland of the United States.

what power does the speaker have? Remember, when she first started
CARLSON: Most of what you're saying is intuitive. It's obvious. Normal people, I think, know it instinctively. So why the change? Was there a groundswell of support for letting people out of prison or not putting them in prison for killing police animals, for example, or rape? I mean, how did we get here?
In 2019 he issued an executive order allowing cities and states to opt out of refugee resettlement. That's the last time we checked in on this story. Here's the amazing part. For some reason no Republican governors are taking advantage of that. Instead, you probably didn't read this in the New York Times but 18 Republican governors have explicitly requested that more refugees be sent to their states. Have their voters demanded this? No. So what's going on here? Ned Ryun is the founder of American Majority and author of Restoring our Republic. He joins us tonight. So, Ned, I don't think there's any evidence that Republican voters in the states have been begging their Republican governors to move more refugees in. So, why are these governors literally asking the federal government to do this?
Whether or not this shambling shutdown harms or helps either political party and to what degree is an entirely open question. But for now, at least, we can conclusively say that it benefits the narrow interests of President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
BARTIROMO: So, do we know if he's considering delaying the State of the
It came just hours after the Democrats narrowly won both Senate runoff elections in Georgia, which gives them a razor-thin majority in the chamber to go along with their slight majority in the House of Representatives. And with Biden just two weeks away from being inaugurated as president, the Democrats will control both the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.
ARROYO: Privately that's not what he saying.

HARF: Well, Chris, I think, number one has to be getting his team in place.
The Taliban was driven from power in a matter of weeks. Over the next few years, al Qaeda's senior leadership was disrupted and scattered—largely to neighboring Pakistan. And in May 2011, Usama bin Laden was found and killed by U.S. Special Operations Forces. So the original mission has been long since accomplished.

In other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, Muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 American households. And if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. Since 1978 CEO salaries in America's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. Meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. In 1965, CEOs in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. As recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. Today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. No wonder people are sending money to Bernie Sanders. That's what happens when you abuse the system. You discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. Now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. In Europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. Airbus CEO Tom Enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. That's a lot, but it was half as much as Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg made, and Airbus planes didn't even crash. This is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. It's dangerous for our country. Why? Well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like Dennis Muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. Attitudes are changing fast.

America's message to the Kremlin should be unequivocal: actions have consequences, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a statement. Administrator Bridenstine's invitation to Dmitry Rogozin, one of the leading architects of the Kremlin's campaign of aggression toward its neighbors, undercuts our message and undermines the United States' core national security objectives.

Medicare-for-all in particular is quickly picking up support. A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls. Such proposals would lead to more government involvement in health care, and bring the U.S. a step closer to mostly socialized systems such as the British National Health Service. Their popularity is driven by frustration with the current private insurance system, which remains costly on the individual market despite ObamaCare's goals. And while Medicare-for-all is estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, advocates argue some of this would replace out-of-pocket expenses already being shouldered by millions of Americans.

Cocaine overdose deaths rose to about 14,500 in 2017, twice what they were in 2015. Some areas of the country have seen a sharper rise in cocaine- and meth-related deaths. Often, illicit opioids such as fentanyl are mixed in with the drugs. In Connecticut, from a mix of cocaine and fentanyl soared to 220 in 2017 from 42 in 2015.
HOLMES: Yes. I think, given what we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings and everything else, you can -- you can say what you will, but this will be the first time that there is a seat that actually changes from a liberal held seat to a conservative held seat. And -- and if you think the Kavanaugh hearings was divisive, wait until you get a load of this. I mean this will be the -- the granddaddy of them all in terms of Supreme Court battles.

Romney's main complaint in the piece is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true, of course. But beneath the personal slights, Romney has a policy critique of Trump. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.
As much as I have always admired Bob Woodward and admire now him in the sequester fight and for his willingness to take on the White House, I cannot refrain from expressing my disappointment that this man, who did such a service for the country 40 years ago, has essentially taken himself off the boards of the Benghazi fiasco. I wish that if Woodward were to get in a fight, he would do it on an issue that really matters to the safety of the United States.
But there's no guarantee that that's going to be the case. And the big risk is that unwittingly, just as Barack Obama thought the Iraq war was a mistake. Donald Trump thought the Iraq war was a mistake, but the people end up doing some of the same mistakes, repeating some of the same mistakes that they campaigned against. What we really want to do is avoid an Iraq-like war with Iran.

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. With opening statements in President Trump's impeachment trial set for this Tuesday, he's added several high-profile names to his defense team, including Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz, not a full-time fledged member of the team, but he will present constitutional arguments against impeachment.

The President has been focused on an agenda. He has a team. He's got Tony Sayegh, Pam Bondi, Patsy Baloney (ph). They've got great people to White House focus on impeachment. But the President himself is focused on an economy that is ripping right now. On the national security front, he takes out Qasem Soleimani and the Democrats are so invested into hating Trump that they can't root for the Iranians, the millions of Iranians who want to pursue a new direction and they're trying to make the President look bad, taking out Soleimani.
The other thing is, I don't understand how the Democratic Party is going to sit back and take it. Is it really worth it to this Democratic Party in the age of the #metoo movement, Black Lives Matter, you had the first African- American president, you have completely squeezed out and spat out the candidates of color this time, Cory Booker. Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, they are out of the race.

These Senate runoffs were so vital that everything should have been subordinated to winning the two races. This clearly was not done. The bitterness on both sides of the Kemp-Raffensperger versus Trump fight further weakened the GOP at a crucial moment.

He pointed out that the sections of the law in which the president would have to rely, say the president can declare an emergency that, quote, requires the use of armed force, he can do military construction projects that are necessary to support that use of armed force. That seems to me to not apply in this situation.

There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America.

They saw a president who drew red lines in the sand and said oh, we might do this, but didn't do it. President Obama made promises he didn't keep. President Trump makes promises he keeps.

Iran's opaque judiciary and penal system repeatedly tortured Afkari into admitting a killing he did not carry out, according to human rights organizations and Western governments. The clerical rulers hanged Afkari for protesting in 2018 against the economic and political corruption of the regime controlled by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
And then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA. So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California.

J. V. Last: 'The Trump Primary Has Already Begun' - The Bulwark: The smartest thing Barack Obama ever did was running for president when everyone thought Hillary Clinton was invincible. The second smartest thing he did was invite Clinton into his Cabinet and keep her there through his first term. Obama understood that avoiding a primary challenge is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for re-election. … President Trump, on the other hand, seems to be daring someone to run against him in 2020. He frequently insults his fellow Republicans and has made almost no effort to mend fences… He did not bring the people most likely to run against him—John Kasich and Mitt Romney—into his administration. And he has not kept the people who would be most dangerous to him—Nikki Haley and Jim Mattis—on his team. If you only looked at this top-line data, you'd almost think Trump wants a primary challenger. Maybe he does.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tx., told FoxNews.com: The Ayatollahs persecute Christians, and anyone else who refuses to accept their theocratic vision, because they fear freedom of conscience. Iran's repeated and worsening persecution of Christians is unacceptable and must stop. It is imperative that we support religious liberty around the world, and work to end the persecution of Christians and people of all faiths.
She then asked Nunes what he plans to do about it as an elected official.
WALLACE: You were -- you've anticipated where we're going to go because one of the statements back and forth had to do with these comments that Michael Bloomberg made about stop and frisk in 2015. Take a look.

This guy is apparently the media mob's, the Democrats' new Michael Avenatti. And naturally, they are making him their hero, a guy that's been accused of taking a million dollars and hiding it from Russia. These are the same people, especially on fake news CNN and over there at conspiracy TV, Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow's conspiracy channel, both are state-run TV.
How do you negotiate with the speaker of the House when she tells you even if you open up the government are not going to give you but $1 for the wall? So, until that changes, there's not much left except the national emergency approach.
That money completes a total of about $16 billion for the wall system, Morgan said, which will fund a total of almost 800 miles of new wall.
INGRAHAM: Up ahead, my exclusive interview with President Trump continues. His thoughts on Nancy Pelosi's failed political gambit. The big news that the speaker is sending the articles to the Senate. And later, Raymond Arroyo reacts to the President's thoughts on the rogue royals and a lot more. Breaking news all ahead. Stay there.

Rainey said she attended the Trump rally while on leave and didn't advertise that she was an Army officer. She said Sunday that her commanders had not inquired about her time in Washington, but she did not immediately respond to a subsequent inquiry about the Army's investigation.

Of course, precautions like mask-wearing and social distancing will help. But we also need to re-evaluate how we approach testing, understanding that information is key to controlling the spread of infection, so we should equip Americans with as much information as possible.

Mike Pompeo: The Obama administration created enormous risks to the American people in Iran. This administration is working to reduce that risk.
CORKE: So, while the president stays here and then heads to Camp David, remaining in Washington will be Vice President Mike Pence.

I think your history comment for [Friday] is a bit off or at least does not tell the whole story. The 44 Colt model of 1847 was a collaboration of Sam Walker and Colt in 1846-47. Walker was with the Texas Rangers at the time and wanted a more powerful weapon for the Mexican-American war. The 1000 US military orders were for the State of Texas Military is my understanding. The 44 Walker was the most powerful handgun until the 357 Magnum came along in 1935. They were called 'horse pistols' as they commonly were carried on the pommel of the saddle. These were powerful, accurate repeating weapons. Sam Walker carried two at the time of his death. Military Walkers are stamped with the US and 1847 on the left side of the revolver. Original Walkers are exceptionally expensive. Beat up ones might set you back 40 to 60 thousand dollars while the few really nice ones that are properly authenticated go for nearly a million. I attached a few pictures of me shooting my replica. They are fun guns to shoot and it teaches you a lot about patience as it takes a while to load up the black powder (pyrodex replica in my case) and it is quite powerful. My targets are not the best in the world but certainly show that the revolver could be quite accurate at 25 yards.
TERRELL: Can you tell me California -- can you tell me California come and show me the blacks that you are talking about? I don't see the blacks were whispering I'm voting for Trump. Can you come to California for about a weekend and we can go on a tour?

In an interview with NBC News' Today, Pelosi was asked repeatedly whether she believed Mueller should honor and observe Justice Department guidance that keeps sitting presidents off limits from indictment.
Trump is facing blame by some in the party for the GOP losses in Georgia, due to his repeated claims that his narrow defeat in the state to Biden was due to fraud, and for his numerous vocal attacks on Georgia's Republican governor and secretary of state for refusing to aid his attempts to upend the state's election results.
I was not afraid at all.
The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments, new public banks can be created (as in WWII) to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools (including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes) can be employed, it says.
Bartiromo then asked, How do you make the case that there was violence on Parler and not on all these other sites?
But frankly, diversity is the least of the Democrats' worries, if you ask me. Their top three candidates, those old white folks, they are struggling to find a coherent message, and at this point are just at each other's throats. The Sanders campaign is reportedly telling volunteers manning the phone backs or knocking on doors to frame Warren as the candidate of the elites. When she heard this, Warren went on the warpath.

Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, a strong Trump supporter who crisscrossed the 2020 campaign trail on behalf of the president – and who may have national ambitions of his own in 2024– said late Wednesday in a statement that it's past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence.

The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - better known to some as the Iran nuclear deal - aims to curtail Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions for a limited period, in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA in May 2018 because the agreement failed to stop Iran's drive to secure nuclear weapons or to halt its aggression and ballistic missie program in the Middle East, according to President Donald Trump.

He didn't say what those measures would be. But while some people are suggesting they might ask U.S. troops to leave the country, the U.S. is, in fact, sending more troops over. 4,000 to come into the region. They're coming from the Eighty Second Airborne. They're heading to Kuwait. 750 have already come into Baghdad to protect the embassy there. So, somewhat conflicting ideas at the moment. President Trump saying that he does not want war, that they killed Qasem Soleimani to avoid bloodshed because he was planning more attacks on Americans. But at the moment, suddenly heightened, heightened tensions here. Tucker?

MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Good Sunday morning, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, Joining me straight ahead right here on Sunday Morning Futures, let the oral arguments begin. Coming up this morning, an exclusive interview with Senator Ted Cruz ahead of the Senate impeachment trial beginning this Tuesday. Also, one of the newest members of President Trump's legal team, former federal prosecutor Robert Ray, is here to discuss the president's case. Then, Donald Trump Jr. here on the trial, the attempts to take down his father and the election year ahead. Plus, breaking news this morning into John Durham's criminal investigation into the FBI with Congressman Jim Jordan, ranking Republican on the House Oversight Committee. Joining me ahead to look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. So, the week has arrived. The Senate trial will begin this Tuesday. How long will this impeachment trial last? Here is Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham on this program two weeks ago.
Why are the Left and the Never Trumpers really upset that Trump acted?
Study shows that in the process of eradicating extremism, the minds of Uygur women in Xinjiang were emancipated and gender equality and reproductive health were promoted, making them no longer baby-making machines, the embassy tweeted on Thursday. They are more confident and independent. Chinese authorities have subjected Uighur women to forced abortions, sterilization and other human rights violations, according to watchdog groups.
CAVUTO: Right. Did he money with him to pay for it? Because I didn't...
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Over the past few weeks, there have been several crucial disclosures of evidence that appear to further incriminate the President. Each disclosure bolstering the argument we Democrats have made for a trial that features the relevant witnesses and documents.
What else? Oh, the GAO comes out. Perfectly timed. Gives a damn, another bureaucracy. Donald Trump broke the law.
I can't get inside his head. It's obviously a sore subject for him politically, and maybe personally, too. Admitting to a significantly higher death toll in nursing homes will undercut his self-image as an effective leader in a crisis, confirm that he has been distorting statistics and hiding facts, and give ammunition to his bitterest political enemies. Flouting the Freedom of Information Law looks bad, but he evidently calculates that the alternative is worse.
Conservatives warn these ambitious programs, though, would do generational damage to the U.S. economy.
U.S. and China. Is this same deal that you told us about at the end of last year?
But Trump has been more blunt, taking a results-oriented consistency when judging the judges.

Travel outside the island became less restrictive, and some of the government's most vocal critics, including Guillermo Farinas and Yoani Sanchez, were allowed to travel abroad – where they firmly assailed the island's political leaders in speeches and media interviews -- and return to Cuba. Many of those moves did not occur under Fidel Castro's leadership.
Shame on Mitt Romney. Publishing an ad hominem attack on President Trump in The Washington Post on the cusp of occupying a Senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the Oval Office was dishonorable. In addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about Romney: that he is not to be trusted.
Before China knew what was happening, it would be cut off from the overseas sources of energy and raw materials that fuel its import/export economy. Within weeks it would be without fuel and its factories would be shuttered. The American economy, established in a nation that has most resources domestically available, would be able to ride out the storm, even if China attempted to climb the escalation ladder and attack targets in North America.

Romney became fantastically rich doing this.
He made a calculation that as long as this general was alive, things would be more dangerous for the United States. Soleimani was not acting as a brake on the Iranian regime. He was acting as an accelerant.
GRAHAM: I just talked to them about 30 minutes ago. He says let's make a deal. They did not turn down wall for the bridge, that's not that story line. I tried to see if we could open up the government for limited period of time to negotiate a deal and the president says, let's make a deal, then open up the government.
The other is that she wants him to have a State of the Union where there's
During congress meetings last week, Kim labeled the U.S. as our foremost principal enemy and disclosed a list of high-tech nuclear weapons systems under development to cope with what he called intensifying American hostility. He said the fate of relations between Pyongyang and Washington depend on whether the U.S. abandons its hostile policy.
I don't know what Romney's reasons are for his new attack on President Trump. I do know that in light of Romney's flipflops on Trump, he cannot portray his op-ed as principled opposition to Mr. Trump.
KASRAIE: So I just want to give out a quick shout out to President Trump. There is a picture circulating right now on social media. There's a wall in Iran, as soon as the news broke, it's a hashtag, which in English translates to Trump, you're the man. So thank you, President Trump, for having moral courage to make such a hard decision.
Iraq Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi denounced the strikes, saying that the leader of the Iranian-based militia is a U.S. designated terrorist.
As of Jan. 4, New York was averaging a whopping 14,089 new cases per day.
After a days-long rift, Trump and Pence met in the Oval Office to discuss the final days of their administration and its accomplishments since assuming office in 2016, an administration official with knowledge of the meeting told Fox News' chief White House correspondent John Roberts.
The White House's excuse, that this information cannot be revealed because of an FBI investigation, is eerily and frighteningly similar to Nixon telling H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman to turn off the Watergate investigation as it threatened national security.
Son, I'm not asking you to go to school, Deputy Whyte said. I'm telling you. Now quit wasting my time. Get out of bed and get dressed.
From the first day, Stone's prosecution was a transparent political hit job. Washington wanted him in prison because for 40 years, he was Donald Trump's closest political adviser.
He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said after a contentious meeting at the White House on Wednesday. But they can't. (Trump walked out of the meeting after Pelosi flatly refused to consider any spending bill that included wall funding.)

Seeking peace does not require laying aside or compromising your deeply held convictions. I know I haven't. But every political cause has to be sought in the right way—not through violence and hatred, but instead with respect for law, personal humility, and charity towards all.
Back in Washington, Democrats on Thursday were blocked in the Senate after trying to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to pointless show votes.
This one may be obvious, but of course known terrorists end up on the no-fly list. The man who tried to bomb a Northwest Airlines flight in 2009 and the man convicted of planting a car bomb in Times Square in 2010 both were on the no-fly list (they were able to board planes anyway). Last year, the Intercept obtained a secret document issued by the National Counterterrorism Center that details how the government puts people on the no-fly list as well as on terrorist databases. It lists people convicted of or arrested for acts of terrorism, bombers, hostage takers, assassins, associates of terror groups, and others. According to the document, federal agencies can nominate someone for a government blacklist if an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.

The National Republican Congressional Committee on Wednesday criticized the comments from Democratic lawmakers, saying they are pushing for a socialist agenda.
Especially over the past decade, counterterrorism has not only encouraged inertia, but also has served as a smokescreen to put the U.S. in a de facto alliance with Iran, including the Obama administration providing Iranian-led militias with cover and support for ground operations, he added. The Trump administration has been slowly moving away from that, first through quiet acquiescence to ti Israeli strikes and now by retaliating directly against attacks by these militias. This change in posture is as necessary as it is overdue.

Romney's main complaint in the piece is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true, of course. But beneath the personal slights, Romney has a policy critique of Trump. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.
Having more than 800,000 federal workers not getting paid, garbage piling up and the multitudinous second-order consequences of a partial government shutdown over the paltry – by federal standards at least – sum of about $3 billion was too farcical even for our current political moment.

HARMAN: It's not a national emergency. It is fulfilling a campaign pledge. The wall is a primal scream. In your conversation with -- your very good conversation just before with Lindsey Graham and Chris Coons, both of them made clear that there are ways that Congress can make a deal. That's the right answer. And I'm going to get in a fight with Josh because I think that Mitch McConnell, his old boss, who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called Playing the Long Ball, is bunting here and he could, if he chose to, rouse a veto proof majority in the Senate to pass what the Senate passed in the last Senate, which is the collection of CRs and then just leave one, that would be the Department of Homeland Security bill, with a shorter time frame to negotiate, have Lindsay and, as far as I'm concerned, Chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on TV, which maybe Trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it.
But, Romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted.

ROOKIE MISTAKES? - Days after her profanity-laced call to impeach President Trump, freshman Michigan Democratic Rep. Rep. Rashida Tlaib is under fire for an alleged anti-Semitic reference on Twitter ... Responding to a post by Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday, Tlaib suggested that Senate Republicans were more loyal to Israel than the U.S., amid a report that GOP leaders were planning to introduce a bill that would punish companies that participate in the so-called Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) global movement against Israel.

Reporters lurk everywhere. In fact, there are many more reporters, photographers and technical personnel credentialed to cover Congress than lawmakers themselves.

And we know of course that they're planting various infrastructure and economic institutions all over Africa, all over Asia, that their entire economy is growing and flourishing and yet again we risk focusing on this small region of the world that is obviously important but not nearly as important as our biggest geopolitical rival continuing to gain strength and power.

I'd like to hear from Joe Biden, because, frankly, these are the reasons we're even having this conversation right now.
FOX & Friends, 6 a.m. ET: Special guests include: Charlie Hurt, the Washington Times' opinion editor; Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News' senior judicial analyst; Kurt Knutsson, the cyber guy; Isaac Morehouse, the CEO of Praxis; Brad Meltzer, the FOX Nation host of Secrets of George Washington; Michelle Malkin, a syndicated columnist.
This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people, Trump said. We have to have peace.
PRAGER: The problem is -- it's a big problem. We enjoy each other too much. We're looking for problems.
VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Yes, I think that Trump has really confused people, Laura, because he showed restraint by not reacting to the interception of ships in the Gulf of Hormuz earlier. He didn't react to the drone attack. And then when he did, he didn't brag about it.
Tucker Carlson: One group that absolutely does not think the Iraq war was a mistake are most Republican senators.
Bolton also called Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warm and cordial, without mentioning any misconduct. It seemingly contradicted reported assertions in Bolton's forthcoming book that Trump explicitly told him he wanted to tie military aid to Ukraine to an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. (Zelensky has said his communications with Trump involved no pressure for any investigation.)

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News that he doesn't know what Trump will say during his prime-time address. But Graham added that Trump ideally will not use his presidential emergency powers to order the military to construct a border wall, saying that passing a spending bill in Congress is the better way to tackle the issue.
He continued, They were probably overly aggressive, they didn't pay careful enough attention to some of the details, they may have ignored some aspects of the work that was uncovered. But I think the IG was very clear that politicization did not seem to creep into any aspect of their work either at the initiation of the investigation or throughout.

And Tucker, the President has been working on this from the day that he pulled down the planes from China on, I think, it was January 29th. We're focused like a laser beam on this to keep the public secure. We're hoping for the best, preparing for the worst and we're doing it all on Trump time.

TRUMP: Everybody - I don't want to say. But everybody knows about the whistleblower and they know about the whistleblower's lawyer. But then, do you remember, there was a second whistleblower. I want to know what happened to the second whistleblower. What happened to the informer? Remember that an informer. They all disappeared when I gave the transcript because I gave a transcript and that blew everything apart, because we have an accurate. And if the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree. Everybody. Even our great Lieutenant Colonel, please call him Lieutenant Colonel or great Lieutenant Colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different. We'll change the one word, it meant absolutely nothing. The transcript was professionally done by the best people there. Just one second. So, we have a transcript. They never thought I'd release it. They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call. Think of this. I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.
In this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the south. The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed.

Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th, the president said in a statement posted to Twitter by his social media director. Trump's own account was locked by Twitter for posting tweets earlier in the day that the company claimed appeared to justify the assault on the Capitol.
The Sacramento Bee reported on several of Newsom's recent hires, which seemingly signaled he's serious about his push to bring universal health care to California. Chief of Staff Ann O'Leary worked in former President Bill Clinton's administration on the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which offers affordable health care to children in families who exceed the financial threshold to qualify for Medicaid, but who are too poor to buy private insurance.

One might hope that these common-sense reforms would meet with less resistance from the left than other Trump administration policies, given liberals' championing of due process protections for even enemy combatants and non-citizens residing unlawfully in the U.S. Instead, the Chronicle of Higher Education reports that Reaction to the regulations was swift, with ranking Democrats in the House and Senate condemning the proposals. A typical response was that of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who tweeted that DeVos was siding with predators over survivors …betray[ing] her responsibility to the students she's meant to serve. It's sickening.
For years, the president has used Twitter to communicate directly to the American people -- bypassing the media and other gatekeepers of information. But some of his more fiery tweets have drawn criticism, sometimes from his own party.
Separately, Fox News is told the White House directed the Corps to examine the February 2018 emergency supplemental, which included disaster relief for California, Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico, among other states, to see what unspent funds could be diverted to a border wall, according to a congressional aide familiar with the matter.

Focus autonomous weapons on defense, not offense. In a defensive role, autonomous weapon systems have the potential to lower the probability of conflict. For example, if the United States deployed autonomous weapons that could destroy any missile targeted to hit the US or its allies, a potential adversary would judge such an attack as futile and avoid conflict.

The court has not yet ruled on Biden's latest motion to strike. Shortly after Biden's team filed, an individual in Jerusalem, Joel Caplan, submitted his own bizarre motion to intervene, saying he has lost money in the China hustle.

THE 2020 OIL RISK NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT Consider: In the aftermath of the U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, the price of oil has only increased by a few percent. Contrast this to past conflicts such as the Iraq wars and the Arab oil embargo of 1973, when the oil price skyrocketed. Turmoil in the Middle East no longer threatens the U.S. energy supply. The U.S. now produces and consumes about 20 million barrels of petroleum products a day. Crude oil production has more than doubled over the last decade as the American fracking revolution and good government policy have combined to create countless gushers. The U.S. is now the world's biggest oil producer. Net petroleum imports have fallen from 10 million barrels a day in 2010 -- about 50 percent of consumption -- to zero.

CRUZ: So, I'm very worried. That testimony that you just showed is Dr. Robert Epstein, who's a very respected academic. He's a psychologist, used to be the editor of Psychology Today. And he did an empirical study on Google in 2016 and on the search results they came back -- and he was astonished by the results. He found that, based on manipulated search outcomes, biased search outcomes, that Google in 2016 shifted 2.6 million votes towards Hillary Clinton. Now, here's the interesting thing, Maria. Dr. Epstein is not a Republican. He is a liberal Democrat. He voted for Hillary Clinton. So, politically, he was happy to see more votes for Hillary. But he was horrified to see big tech have that kind of power. And he went on to testify what you just played, which is, if they do the same thing in 2020, which all indications are that they're going to, they could shift up to 15 million votes. It is terrifying that a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires that now control over $5 trillion of the American economy have no accountability and the ability to censor, to deceive and to manipulate votes.

At the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collective—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.

I've been clear that oversight will be a priority of mine as Chairman, and part of that is reestablishing an Foreign Affairs Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which existed for much of the last 20 years. Of course the Committee will still deal with the threat of terrorism. In fact, we're expanding the jurisdiction of our subcommittees for different parts of the world to include terrorism so they're better able to grapple with this problem with a regional focus, Engel said.
GRAHAM: Well, number one, that story came from somebody who leaked it with an agenda. So I'd like to know who leaked it because they have an agenda not very friendly to President Trump and I for one don't trust what I read in The New York Times.
Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to socialism isn't limited to energy and environment-related issues, either. She has also called for the passage of Medicare for All, legislation proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industry—at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.
The growing socialist wing of the Democratic Party will flex its muscle Thursday with the seating of the new Congress, as more self-described Democratic Socialists join the ranks and dozens of sitting and incoming members – including likely 2020 hopefuls – embrace a massive government expansion that would make FDR look like a penny pincher.

The law couldn't be more clear — employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement Sunday. Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump Administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care. It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.
ERIC TRUMP, EXEC VICE PRES, TRUMP ORG: Yes, by the way, it's tough to watch, Laura. I mean, it's really, really tough. You have to - you get paid to watch it because of who I am. It is tough to get through it. I mean, here you have a group that's saying we want to take 160 million people off their private health care plans. It's nuts, right? I mean, you saw - you saw what Buttigieg said about decriminalizing border crossing. So let's just let everybody come. Let's pay for everybody's health insurances. Let's pay for all the problems of the rest of the world. It's crazy. You have Biden who is their front runner, who literally can't get through a sentence without stumbling. The rest of them are totally insane. I mean this is not JFK's Democratic Party. This is a totally radical Democratic Party and quite frankly, I think they're handing my father the win.
Cheong Seong-Chang, a fellow at the Wilson Center's Asia Program, said Kim likely restored the old general secretary title after determining that it would further benefit his dictatorship. Under the previous title systems, Cheong said that there were too many chairmen and vice chairmen at various levels, and that authorities appeared to have thought it wasn't helpful for Kim's authority.
The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election, Twitter stated.

INGRAHAM: Yes, speaking of Biden's brother, you referenced it and the $1.5 billion from China, he got right for his fund, it was not clear that it went to him personally but that's what we want to find out. We want to find out exactly how much he personally profited Hunter Biden which I don't think anyone really knows but it's obviously a lot of money. Joe Biden's brother has been caught now, you've referenced in passing, trying to profit off of his family name, just like old Hunter. ABC news reporting, Frank Biden touted his famous last name and prominent connections in Washington to help land a series of charter contracts from local officials in Florida to open charter schools, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars over a five-year period.

Here's one nugget of sage advice senior lawmakers will tell the Congressional neophytes: Get to know and be nice to the Capitol cops. The U.S. Capitol Police force guards the Capitol 24/7, 365 days a year. It's officers are tasked with a thankless, impossible job. With such a big class of lawmakers coming in, it will take officers a while to learn what all of the newcomers look like. Former Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-GA) famously berated a U.S. Capitol Police officer who didn't recognize her. McKinney poked the officer in the chest with a closed fist.

DONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR: Has President Trump learned in any lesson over the last couple of months? He's on a retribution tour. He's on a revenge tour.
Consequently when Donald Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, exercising the authority he believed he had as president of the United States, he was taking the very action he made famous. It wasn't out of character for him but in character, as he has been throughout his administration. If anything, it's hard to find anyone who has not been fired or threatened with firing. It's what he does.

Now, let's review some of the actions of the FBI director. Many of these actions were clear at the time; others we know only now. What we have learned since underscores that the president's firing of Comey was more than justified, and the actions of Comey's staff and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to trigger the most extensive investigation in history of a campaign, an administration and a president appear to be wholly without justification – and were based instead on politically inspired emotion and hysteria.

JORDAN: Yes. No, I mean, look, they never expected him to do this. One of the great moves the president made is actually release the call transcript. The transcript itself shows no quid pro quo. The two individuals on the call, President Trump and President Zelensky, have repeatedly said there was no pressure, no pushing, no linkage of any type of investigation to the security assistance dollars. Third point, there Ukrainians didn't even know at the time of the call that the aid was on hold, that the aid have been paused. They didn't learn until about a month later from the Politico article. And the most important fact -- and this is one that the Democrats can never get past -- the most important fact is, the Ukrainians took no action, i.e., no announcement, no promise to start, no investigation, no announcement whatsoever about doing an investigation into the Bidens or Burisma to get the aid released. The aid was released because, over that pause time, that 55 days when the aid was paused, the president became convinced that Zelensky was a genuine reformer, and he decided to go ahead and release the hard-earned tax dollars of the American people to Ukraine.
China's leaders assumed after the 2008 global financial crisis that the Communist, centrally controlled economic state's time had come. It would regain its historic role in the region. It could cast off the cloak of a peaceful rise to assume a hegemonic role in the Asia-Pacific region.

In 2019 he issued an executive order allowing cities and states to opt out of refugee resettlement. That's the last time we checked in on this story. Here's the amazing part. For some reason no Republican governors are taking advantage of that. Instead, you probably didn't read this in the New York Times but 18 Republican governors have explicitly requested that more refugees be sent to their states. Have their voters demanded this? No. So what's going on here? Ned Ryun is the founder of American Majority and author of Restoring our Republic. He joins us tonight. So, Ned, I don't think there's any evidence that Republican voters in the states have been begging their Republican governors to move more refugees in. So, why are these governors literally asking the federal government to do this?
The legislation was immediately dismissed by Republican leadership. McConnell, R-Ky., called the bills a time-wasting act of political posturing and said that a resolution will have to be palatable to House Democrats and Senate Republicans alike.

TRUMP: Listen, honestly, he's doing fine. You can see that through his actions. He's used to taking these punches. He's used to getting hit. And guess what? He's just going to keep working. He's actually more of a game time player than anything. So when the pressure is on, he gets things done. And what you're seeing is unprecedented success.

And even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe.
President Trump is right when he argues that drones and technology are not sufficient to stop illegal immigration. Of course, our border patrol forces armed with technology and drones are a lethal force but that combination alone cannot totally prevent illegal immigrants or hostile forces from entering the United States.
This is wrong and needs to change.
Cuomo does get kid-glove treatment from some in the media (especially when he does quick-hit appearances on national TV) but not from the Capitol press corps reporters who cover him on a daily basis. He and his P.R. staff are generally awful to deal with, so there is little love lost. If they don't ask about the nursing home issue more often, it's probably because they know they won't get straight answers and they have dozens of other issues to cover. They might be pushing behind the scenes, and many reporters have filed FOIL requests similar to mine.

GAETZ: Yes, boy. He's covering stuff up faster than a cat in a litter box. I mean when you look at the Biden behavior, it is exculpatory for the President. Think about it. If the Biden's are truly corrupt, it could never be an impeachable offense to investigate corruption or to ask our friends to investigate corruption pursuant to our treaties and so, we will put that evidence on if witnesses are allowed in this trial and we will I think be able to prove dispositively that this President as he has always done was putting the interests of the American people and the American taxpayer first.

Bolton also called Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warm and cordial, without mentioning any misconduct. It seemingly contradicted reported assertions in Bolton's forthcoming book that Trump explicitly told him he wanted to tie military aid to Ukraine to an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden.

My poll, as you know, my poll numbers right now today are the highest they've ever been. And, by the way, people love that we took this horrible terrorist. They love it, Soleimani. The love that we took him out. They think it's so fantastic. He should have been taken out over the last 20 years by somebody. He should have been taken out a long time ago. But my numbers are the highest they've ever been, and a lot of it is because of the impeachment hoax. It's a hoax. How would you like to be two, two-and-a-half years, I'm under investigation, federal investigation before I even ran, in my opinion, before I came down the escalator.

Hotels and resorts introduced extended stay programs and packages en masse last year and that trend will continue in 2021 as guests pursue longer stays.

Uncertainty is strife and it may lead to people going 'all out' on one big trip, rather than risking several smaller ones that could be canceled.

The president tweeted it again last night. We will take the actions necessary to keep Americans safe. You know, as for the activity today with respect to Iraq, we've been in their country. We've been supporting Iraqi sovereignty. We've been continuing to take down the terrorist threat against the Iraqi people. The prime minister is the resigned prime minister. He's the acting prime minister. He's under enormous threats from the very Iranian leadership that it is that we are pushing back against. We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign. And we'll continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe.

The new Speaker of the House has announced that the Democratic Congress will never, under any circumstances, allocate a single tax dollar to build the border wall, not because it's too expensive, obviously, these are the Democrats, but because a wall would violate some previously unknown and never-explained moral code.

During the shocking scene, Acosta refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide and there was brief contact between the two. His White House pass was revoked later that day but it was eventually restored when CNN argued that it violated the network and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights.

With a growing economy, tax cuts, more jobs higher wages, better trade deals for the country, the appointment of conservative judges, peace negotiations with North Korea, a new Mideast policy and in advocating immigration reform, President Trump can honestly state he has covered the backs of the American people.

CBS News: President-elect Joe Biden will announce Thursday he has selected Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for attorney general. Garland serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in 2016. But his nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued the American people should have a say in selecting the president who fills the vacancy. In addition to serving on the D.C. Circuit, where he was its chief judge until February 2020, Garland is a veteran of the Justice Department, leading the prosecutions of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Ted Kaczynski, the 'Unabomber.'
The Trump Justice Department has gone repeatedly to the Supreme Court to lift such court-ordered injunctions, bypassing the traditional appellate process.

A contentious, closed-door meeting on border security at the White House Wednesday ended without any progress. Several senior GOP officials said Democrats didn't seem interested in listening to what Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen had to say.

But, knowing that he would not have the power in a divided government to do much more to protect Black Americans in the South anyway, Hayes capitulated and agreed to pull the troops out and let the terrorists drive Black lawmakers from power.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Lower energy costs are a major boon for small businesses, which use far more energy than ordinary families. High energy costs act as a tax on operations, reducing the available income to hire, raise wages, and expand. Especially for energy-intensive businesses such as manufacturers, low U.S. energy prices offer a competitive advantage over foreign competitors. Unfortunately, Democratic presidential candidates want to raise the cost of energy for ordinary Americans and small businesses by passing new regulations and taxes on traditional uses. For instance, every candidate wants to ban or severely curtail fracking. This would return the country to a position of economic dependence on Middle Eastern nations.

The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election, Twitter said in a statement.

SEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is dangerous now to allow the president of the United States to grow in war powers, undermining those checks and balances, because you may have a sober, deliberative president like President Obama, but the next one could be an impulsive, capricious, un-strategic thinker like President Trump.
TRUMP: But when you do the average click line of my father, and it's 200 people in an evening, and you do that a couple times a week, you know, this is how the game works. But, again, the media pretends that they don't know that that's how the game works.

Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.

And thank goodness, President Trump is doing what he promised to do. He is not just going to simply take hundreds of millions of dollars and throw it into the government without making sure that they are actually going to do things like clean up corruption. That's what the president said he was going to do. That's exactly what President Trump has tried to do.
TRUMP: Of course. This has been their -- impeachment started November 9, 2016, OK? That's when it's been going on. The Washington Post wrote the first -- the case for impeachment 20 minutes after the inauguration. OK? This has been an ongoing saga forever.

You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.'

SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Well, I hope to have the trial over by the end of January. We would use the Clinton model, where you take the record established in the House, let the House managers appointed by Pelosi make the argument. Let the president make his arguments of why the two articles are flawed. And then we will decide whether or not we want witnesses. But this should be done in a couple weeks.
The answers to those questions won't come on Wednesday or on Jan. 20. But how we as a people answer them in the years to come will determine whether America can endure in the Founders' vision and meet the duties that come with our privileged place in history.

Fox News has lots of great coverage of the Georgia runoffs ahead of Tuesday's conclusion (though the actual counting may go on much longer – sorry) and we will be back before the polls close with our full analysis of the race.

Q: Joe Biden has indicated that he wants to reenter an agreement with Iran. Should that happen, what specific requirements would you want to see included?
We're not talking about Special Counsel Robert Mueller or the agenda of the new Democratic House of Representatives or the topsy turvy economy. Like the North Korea summit, the ill-fated election fraud commission and other Trump showstoppers, the semi-shutdown is catnip for coverage and the engagement of his longtime supporters but doesn't add up to much.

Conspicuously, Democrats' lead House impeachment manager Rep.

HANNITY: Oh, same with what Zelensky. No quid or pro or quo.
SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, on Wall Street, people are a little bit surprised, because, as Joe Biden pointed out, Bloomberg has been a Republican most of his life, meaning that he's a proponent of capitalism, lower taxes, less regulation, the trickle-down wealth effect, and now he's talking about a transaction tax on Wall Street, expanding the Volker rule, meaning more oversight for the banks.

Trump, who upended the Republican establishment in winning the White House, is declaring rhetorical war on any official in his party who dares cross him over the election he insists is rigged. Loyalty to the Donald is the only criteria that matters. Otherwise he and his allies dismiss you as a RINO, someone who needs to be expelled from the ranks.

I can't get inside his head. It's obviously a sore subject for him politically, and maybe personally, too. Admitting to a significantly higher death toll in nursing homes will undercut his self-image as an effective leader in a crisis, confirm that he has been distorting statistics and hiding facts, and give ammunition to his bitterest political enemies. Flouting the Freedom of Information Law looks bad, but he evidently calculates that the alternative is worse.

Let's consider a hypothetical, Dershowitz said. Let's assume that President Obama had been told by his advisors that it really is important to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine. But then he gets a call from his pollster and his political adviser, who says we know it's in the national interest to send lethal weapons to the Ukraine, but we're telling you that the left-wing of your party is really going to give you a hard time if you start selling lethal weapons and potentially get into a lethal war with Russia.

PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE DIRECTOR: So Tucker, there's a four part strategy that we're pursuing in Trump time, which is to say as quickly as possible. You start with the personal protective equipment. This is the masks, and the gloves, the Tyvek suits, things like that that our public healthcare workers need. We're making sure that we can secure those supplies tomorrow. H.H.S. is going out with an RFP to secure a half a billion face masks alone.

Focus on semiautonomous weapons, as is current US policy. Semiautonomous weapons requiring a human either in-the-loop or on-the-loop injects human judgment and provides some assurance that weapons will be able to discern combatants from non-combatants.

But I'll tell you what my fear is, is that some Republicans are going to vote for witnesses, we'll get those, the ones the Democrats want and then when we have the votes on bringing witnesses or letting the president choose his witnesses, I think those will fail, not only because of those Republicans but because a whole variety of Republicans may not allow the whistleblower, may not allow Biden for one reason or another because they served with them.
I think it's presumptuous for me to go further down that path -- talking about what ought to happen with the courts, Warnock said in another encounter on the matter in November.

Where does the pressure come and is going to be a surrender by one side to the other? Are they going to sort of lay down the instruments of war? Or is there going to be a compromise that involves something that the president ends up giving to Democrats, whether it's on DACA, the dreamers, people with temporary protected status,, whatever?
Maybe as coaches, we can be more humane, Budenholzer said. If you know you're going to see that guy the next night, I don't know, you better be careful and know that he's probably sleeping on whatever it is you've said.

And it's part of a larger narrative. They're really angry about the Soleimani death. But Donald Trump was very deliberate. He explained what happened. He didn't go to the White House Correspondents Dinner like Obama did and joke about predator assassination.

The Democrats don't have that right now. I think, you know, anything is possible. The economy could turn sour sometime during this year, but at this point in the 1992 campaign the economy had already been in recession for a while, and people were very discontented. That's not the case right now. So, President Trump looks very strong to me.

The proposed rules, which will become final after a 60-day public comment period that will likely result in some revisions, are intended to replace seriously-flawed Obama administration guidance on the same subject. That guidance, issued without public input, gave accused students—nearly always male and, as journalist Emily Yoffe has documented in The Atlantic, disproportionately black—little opportunity to defend themselves despite possible expulsion, rescission of job offers and graduate school admission, and other career-damaging consequences.
Biden has said that he would like to form a new agreement with Iran to deal with their nuclear aspirations. A previous agreement was reached in 2015 when Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the multi-nation agreement, which Israel opposed before the U.S. ever joined it.

WILLIAMS: No, not surrender. See, I don't think it's a matter of capitulation or surrender. I think it's a matter of saying to the president, let's be honest about this. You had two years of Republican majorities, didn't get done. You had the Senate majority leader say let's negotiate. You refused. So it's bad behavior.
Since Benghazi, when I raised the alarm about a media that was not only willing to blatantly support one political party or one political a candidate but for the first time seemed willing to suppress or ignore the facts and truth as related to a disaster of American foreign policy, my fear has been that we are now on a slippery slope. Almost everything since then has helped to realize that fear. Chuck Hagel, the sequester, Mr. Obama's speeches -- all of these have revealed a mainstream press that has absolutely decided to wear its bias openly as outriders of the Obama administration. Except for one issue -- when the president refused to allow reporters to cover him and Tiger Woods playing golf together. Now that's something they can get riled up about.

CAVUTO: Another thing that's interesting, Jason, from the Democratic perspective -- you're the expert here -- that the idea that Michael Bloomberg has not to really pick apart the economy and the numbers and the jobs gains and the markets, but to talk about, with that success and the money you can raise from these who've done very well, to get to these other goals.

Although less accurate than the FDA's preferred polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, these tests are quite accurate for detecting contagiousness, which is what matters most during this pandemic. Additionally, it is arguably more useful than PCR because it's quicker and less likely to detect the virus after the person is no longer contagious. Any false positive – or a suspicious negative for that matter – result can always be caught by double-checking with a PCR test or a second rapid-test that targets a different antigen. This useful, quick test will save more lives than the current, highly accurate but, very slow test.

The press conference underscored how far apart both sides are, even as Trump called the meeting productive and suggested the standoff could end soon -- or not. He indicated he was not shifting on his demand for more than $5 billion for funding for a wall on the southern border, saying it was necessary as the border is a dangerous, horrible disaster.
Pressley also touted universal health care, housing, jobs, food and economic justice in a Wednesday tweet.
James Comey initiated his relations with Trump by holding a one-on-one meeting at which he detailed the allegations of the Steele dossier without disclosing its source.

And the last I have heard, I think there's been about 100,000 ticket requests for the president. We're proud to have him. We're proud to have the president.

Despite the very positive news of vaccines becoming available, the reality is that they will not be available for all Americans until the second half of 2021. The lack of widespread vaccine availability has many implications, including the significant economic impact the virus is having on the American worker and economy.
President Trump is also requesting $675 million for new technology to detect and stop the flow of illegal drugs over the border. Democrats have long said they wanted that. But Democrats don't want to have an honest conversation about border security. They are now the party of obstruction, and everything must bend to their resist Trump goals. The Hill reports that their latest strategy is to jam up the Senate by refusing to consider any legislation until the government is reopened.
In the meantime, concerns over Bolton potentially divulging classified information, as well as violating the legal principle of executive privilege, have emerged.

SCHUMER: Given that Mr. Bolton's lawyers have stated, he has new and relevant information to share. If any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we've requested, they would make it absolutely clear, they are participating in a cover-up.
Of course, we need a vaccine to get the virus completely under control. However, we could put these measures in place immediately, which would greatly increase information and the ability of all of us to act more responsibly as we continue to battle the pandemic.

What is fascinating is, his team has already come out and said that this isn't his forte. He's not great at public speaking. So they're already downplaying the expectations just a little bit. So, hopefully -- they're hoping, even if he doesn't have a super strong showing, it won't hurt him too badly in the polls.
At the end of the day, though, Democrats have said over and over again that they support border security, that they support protecting American citizens -- now, it's time to fulfill some of those statements that they've made -- work with the president, let's get this done; let's open the government back up.

Rogozin, a nationalist politician who was sanctioned in 2014 by the EU, Canada and former U.S. President Barack Obama for his role in promoting the destabilization in Crimea when he was deputy prime minister, had been slated to visit America but NASA said Friday it was rescinding his invitation after complaints from U.S. lawmakers.
So here's the question: I understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of Democrats, including Pelosi, including Schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. So why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that Lindsey Graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on Dreamers and on TPS immigrants?
But if people play games with the witnesses and, all of a sudden, we have one side and we have John Bolton who has an ax to grind about being fired coming in, but we don't let the president call witnesses he wishes to call, I think all hell's going to break loose, and I think the Republican electorate will boot out any of these people who allow this to be a one- sided episode.
CRUZ: And the reason is, I think dismissing this cases is a much less attractive option than rendering final judgment and acquitting the president.
Criticizing the Obama administration, Pompeo said that in the past the United States grossly underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism, a debauched strain of the faith that seeks to upend every other form of worship or governance. ISIS drove to the outskirts of Baghdad as America hesitated. They raped and pillaged and murdered tens of thousands of innocents. They birthed a caliphate across Syria and Iraq and launched terror attacks that killed all across continents.

And so I hope that the senators understand that and that they cannot turn this into a very partisan circus which is what we saw in the House.

But I have been paying careful attention to people who are. David French (ph) in The National Review had, I thought, a particularly penetrating article on this. He pointed out that the sections of the law in which the president would have to rely, say the president can declare an emergency that, quote, requires the use of armed force, he can do military construction projects that are necessary to support that use of armed force. That seems to me to not apply in this situation.

The president is getting it from both Democrats and Republicans slamming some of his clemency and pardon decisions.
At least we are learning how this all really started, even as the answers continue to grow ever more unsettling.
PIRRO: Good to see you. Bye.
Washington, D.C., police said late Wednesday that the security breach at the U.S. Capitol resulted in four deaths – including a woman who had been shot – and at least 52 arrests. At least 14 officers were also wounded during the demonstrations, according to authorities.
It was just one slap in the face after another; it was horrific, she said. I would like to see a complete investigation that isn't only focused on sexual trauma because there are a lot more issues at that base. It needs drastic oversight. We thought we had to be worried about sending our children to foreign soil, but it turns out we have to be more worried about them here.
But the 2012 presidential campaign is already underway with a field of Republican candidates taking shape. And that is where your faithful Fox News political analyst needs your help. I want you to send me questions for the candidates who will be on stage for the first debate of the GOP primary season.
He apologized for it when he got into the race. But, for many, it wasn't enough. And let's face it. Joe Biden really needs something tonight, but he has never performed that well in any of the debates. And, in fact, most people who have done well in the debates did so when they were targeting Biden.
We had an election that was stolen from us, Trump said in the video taped from the White House. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.
As a Republican who began his volunteer activities in Georgia in the 1960 Richard Nixon-Henry Cabot Lodge presidential campaign (I was in high school and there was such a small Georgia GOP then that every volunteer was welcome) I think it is necessary to have the courage to face the depth and scale of Tuesday's disaster in the two Senate runoff elections in Georgia won by Democrats.
During the meeting, Kim also vowed to build more sophisticated nuclear weapons, disclosed economic developmental goals and reshuffled party officials. But observers doubt whether such moves can offer North Korea any substantial solutions to difficulties that include coronavirus-related economic shocks, natural disasters and persistent U.S.-led sanctions.
Q: What do you think could happen if Joe Biden enters into an agreement with the same terms as the old one that President Obama entered, without consulting with Israel or Arabs?
They speak in high minded terms about technology and other assets that can control infiltration across the rugged terrain. To be sure, our border control forces already employ significant technology and do a superb job, but just like our troops in combat, without barriers, there is no way to channel the flow of those you're charged with detaining.
RAY: So, I very much appreciate it.
Well I'm not focused on any of those things, Warnock said, adding that he was more concerned with health care. Sometimes these words just become political buzzwords.
The White House requested eight minutes to make Trump's case on television. It invited representatives from cable news outlets to a White House lunch with Trump ahead of the address, a gesture that is typically reserved for the lead-up to State of the Union speeches.

During his opening-day speech at the congress, Kim called the difficulties the worst-ever and unprecedented. He also admitted his previous economic plans had failed and vowed to adopt a new five-year development plan.
With the exception of a corrupt and privileged elite, almost everyone remaining in Venezuela is now destitute. The government stopped reporting poverty statistics in 2015, but by some outside estimates, 90 percent of the oil-rich country now lives in poverty.

ELLEITHEE: So, on the comment, I'd -- I'd -- I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with anything Jonah said. The -- I spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and I think that is wrong and I don't think Democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize Democrats for acting like him. So I wish he wouldn't have used that language.

BARTIROMO: Well, we're at a 50-year low in unemployment. And we have got a consumer that is obviously -- the sentiment and spending is very strong. Economic growth has moved.

The Mechanicsburg Area School District (MASD) told Fox News in a statement that it was aware of the situation and was investigating the matter.
WALLACE: But they're not coming across the southern border, Sarah. They're coming and they're being stopped at airports.
CARLSON: Well, with brutal housing costs and a severe epidemic of homelessness, Seattle has become San Francisco with worse weather. So what's the priority of lawmakers there?
HUCKABEE: It's just the absurdity of what we are dealing with. Some people eat their soup louder than others. It doesn't mean their soup tastes better. Some people are very expressive in their faith, others are very reserved. But the point is, if Donald Trump is a part of anything that is spiritual or the evangelicals are around him, it's cult-like. But if it happens with Biden, it's just a wonderful expression of an affirmation of a faith that he doesn't practice very well because he is supposedly to be a Catholic, but he's yet pro-abortion. That's a hard one to reconcile.
It is not without a bit of irony that, in the 40 years since the explosion of the Watergate story, Bob Woodward would again be under attack from the White House for trying to tell the truth. But this time the attack is coming from a Democrat.
The proposed rules, which will become final after a 60-day public comment period that will likely result in some revisions, are intended to replace seriously-flawed Obama administration guidance on the same subject. That guidance, issued without public input, gave accused students—nearly always male and, as journalist Emily Yoffe has documented in The Atlantic, disproportionately black—little opportunity to defend themselves despite possible expulsion, rescission of job offers and graduate school admission, and other career-damaging consequences.
For the first time in American history more businesses are closing each day than starting up.

And it kind of is one of those situations, Neil, where the numbers and the results are speaking for themselves, not these grandiose, hopeful plans of how things are going to work out so great for everybody, when we all know, I mean, in economics, there are winners and there are losers, not everybody wins, but people strive to win.

Texas fired football coach Tom Herman on Saturday, weeks after athletic director Chris Del Conte seemingly backed him.

The deaths ruled a suicide – they need to be investigated. Why did they take their lives? Were those deaths properly investigated? Was it really a suicide, or was it a murder? Everything needs to be questioned, she added. We can't just pretend the last 20 years didn't happen.

In the clip, a fan of the president claimed another traveler threatened to kill the supporters on the plane as yelling continued back and forth. Footage of the fight has since gone viral on Twitter; the user who posted the clip alleged that cabin crew was struggling to control the scene.

Based on our preliminary review, the manuscript appears to contain significant amounts of classified information, Knight wrote to Bolton's attorney.
WALLACE: And then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on Super Tuesday you face another centrist candidate in Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, a big story in The Washington Post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.

CICILLINE: I mean, I think we believe the government must reopen immediately. I mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the TSA. I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.

Danon: First I hope that the new administration will speak to allies in the region -- Israel and Arab countries -- before they take any steps regarding Iran. I think that would be the wise thing to do. And we hope that they will not try to appease the Iranians because we know that they're lying all the way around.

In January, a three-judge court found that the map violated the Constitution and ordered the state to come up with a new plan quickly, in time for the 2018 elections.

One expert welcomed the increased U.S. attention on the Kosovo-Serbia issue, particularly in the context of the larger Balkans framework.

The pace of war is escalating exponentially, driven by the increasing use of computer technology. As the arms race continues, the potential for an unintended conflict is going up. As seen during the Cold War between the US and Russia, we came dangerously close to nuclear war on a number of occasions. Only human judgment averted all-out armageddon.

On this broader issue of Barr and the Democratic reaction, I think your question was good. Have the Democrats learned their lesson? We have people talking about impeachment of Bill Barr, which I think is ludicrous.

INGRAHAM: Eric, the 'Real Clear Politics' average right now. Joe Biden, despite their attempts I think to kind of knock him down a peg or two, he's still way up there. 27 percent. Now this is a national poll so people focus on state by state so I understand but still an interesting snapshot. Sanders is at 19. Warren's at 16. Buttigieg, who we've relentlessly seen pushed by the media and Hollywood, way down below everybody at 7.2 percent. So is this Joe Biden's to lose in my view. Politico, I think it was Politico had a headline today, you know, they - all their efforts have to not. Biden's still at the top of the heap.

Jason Miller, a senior advisor to Trump's 2020 campaign, called the move disgusting.
I was really surprised at how little impact descriptions of Warnock's radicalism had on voters who normally would have been appalled at some of his positions. Because of polarization they had picked their team and they resented, rather than listened to, negative information about their side.

Lawmakers make lots of promises about the bills they intend to pass. But in reality, there are only about 60 Members in both the House and Senate with the acumen to advance major legislation. That's not to say lawmakers can't sign on to and co-sponsor bills which move successfully across the House and Senate floors. But those capable of engineering a bill from scratch and shepherding it through final passage is a pretty limited group. Some are in fact freshmen. Some grow into that role down the road. And some never master this skill.

CORKE: From the Situation Room, Rose Garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to Congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., MINORITY LEADER: This is ridiculous and it's cruel and it needs to end now.
Partly because walls are only a delaying obstacle, building them is only half the issue. After their construction, they need to be constantly monitored—often the harder task, even with advanced technology. In this sense, the Israeli effort around Gaza is particularly instructive. The Israeli-Gaza border after all is comparatively tiny, about 60 kilometers or less than a fiftieth the length of United States-Mexican border, and the Israelis still need to devote ample technological resources and manpower to watching it. And even so, these walls have not been foolproof.

INGRAHAM: And John Bolton says, he's now willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial, if he's subpoenaed. But is that going to happen? And what effect will it have? Senator Ron Johnson is here exclusively with reaction. Plus, was killing Soleimani illegal. That's new thing they're claiming. Congressman Doug Collins, I cannot wait to hear him on that. Stay there.
South Korea's spy agency said Kim is worrying about U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is to take office on Jan. 20. Biden has called Kim a thug and is unlikely to hold any direct meetings with him unless North Korea takes serious steps toward denuclearization. The Kim-Trump diplomacy broke down during a summit in Vietnam in early 2019 after Trump rejected Kim's offer to dismantle his main nuclear complex, a limited disarmament step, in return for broad sanctions relief.

The Bravo host, who has co-hosted CNN's New Year's coverage since the network fired Kathy Griffin for posing with a faux-decapitate President Trump during a photo shoot, complained on-air that Univision has umbrellas on its set.

I mean she and Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader in the Senate set out to number one, try to get a commitment from McConnell on witnesses, firsthand witnesses to have them testify in a Senate trial. She also said she wanted to see a resolution about how the whole proceedings would be governed. She got neither of those.

But the result has been a continuing struggle by the government of the Republic of Cuba in determining the definition of success and the level of success permitted for a citizen, he said.

This week, Schiff said Bolton needed to testify in the impeachment trial as an important and believable witness.
So, my point has been, as you and I have been talking about a lot lately, is to stop treating this as if it's a real trial and not a political operation. This is a new political weapon in modern political -- in our modern political world, and Donald Trump is the first victim.

First, Comey's tweets and comments reveal that he despised Trump, and so the self-serving memos he was making and then leaking about his every contact with the president were likely part of an effort to build a case against Trump. We learned that the FBI was wiretapping a number of Trump campaign officials largely on the basis of the Steele dossier. We learned that the dossier was authored by an operative who hated Trump and paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign via hidden payments to their law firm. And we learned that Comey sent FBI agents to question General Michael Flynn about perfectly legal conversations they already had transcripts of, without following White House protocol, in a deliberate effort to entrap him.
REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: No, I don't think we are demanding a surrender, but what we're demanding is that the government be reopened. We passed appropriations bill that were passed unanimously by the Senate. They were supported by Republicans. There was an agreement on those bills.

The answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. And yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.

The decision by the Trump administration not to recertify the Iran nuclear deal in 2017 was undoubtedly the right call and in America's best interests. However, even if the United States never withdrew from the deal, the sunset provisions poorly negotiated in the agreement would now be upon us, meaning Iran would be well on its way to obtaining a nuclear weapon all while having violated not only the spirit but the letter of the deal.
UKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: It's all over Ukrainian media as well today and yesterday, and strangely enough, my name was not mentioned although I'm minister of foreign affairs. And, frankly, I never spoke with this individual. Again, I don't -- I don't trust any word he is now saying.

Thus, handed these cards and with the escalation on the ground that put our troops and personnel at risk, Donald Trump had to weigh the options and he had to make a decision. So, was it better for the U.S. to allow Soleimani to parade openly around Iraq with no forceful response after he fomented the attack on our embassy and was plotting more?

There were little pictures of all the things Cuomo loved about himself. His sports car, his dog, his staff members, the boyfriend of one of his daughter's depicted hanging off a cliff and a giant nose with a cotton swab inside of it. The giant nose image was perhaps a reference to a giggly interview with his news anchor brother Chris on CNN about getting a COVID test while body bags were piling up in storage trucks outside of funeral homes in the state.

If now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated. – Alexander Hamilton, in his essay The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, Federalist No. 9

But this whole situation with legacy media and many other individuals looking down their noses at good people who want to be able to protect themselves. I mean, for crying out loud, let's look at Maryland, for example. Maryland, back in just a couple of years ago, when they passed their National Firearms Act, I think this is 2013, 2014. It was all with the promise that, look, law enforcement is going to take care of you. The state is going to protect you. You don't need your firearms to protect yourselves. And then look what happened. Baltimore's homicide rate, their violent crime rate spiked by 300 percent. It's insane. People want to be able to defend themselves because they know that the state, even though the state promises them that they're going to do this, they never make good on it. In fact, some of the biggest errors that we have seen with previous mass casualty incidents had been because people in government have dropped the ball.

That is precisely the role that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi find themselves in at this particular juncture. And instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government, Nancy Pelosi's telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up -- open up the government and fund the wall.

Although less accurate than the FDA's preferred polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, these tests are quite accurate for detecting contagiousness, which is what matters most during this pandemic. Additionally, it is arguably more useful than PCR because it's quicker and less likely to detect the virus after the person is no longer contagious. Any false positive – or a suspicious negative for that matter – result can always be caught by double-checking with a PCR test or a second rapid-test that targets a different antigen. This useful, quick test will save more lives than the current, highly accurate but, very slow test.

They said, we'll have it there tomorrow. I said, no, you'll have it there today. We're not going to have another Benghazi on our hands. And we did a really amazing job, get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything and that's OK. In the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things. But I think you would have had another Benghazi had we not acted quickly. That could have been stopped. And this was stopped. And we had our Apaches going there, the great helicopters and they were dropping flares all over the place and a lot of things were happening. They had action real fast and everybody disappeared.

Yeah, in some places we do need a physical barrier, because that's what the experts tell us -- that's what the Border Patrol tells us, Cornyn said. I, for one, would rather listen to the experts than the politicians in Washington, D.C.
BARTIROMO: Right. What a week this will be. I want to take a break. When we come back, there are some areas where you agree with your colleagues on the left. One of them is about big technology and how powerful technology companies have come. There were worries that the big tech companies cheated in the 2016 election. I want to ask you if you expect them to cheat in 2020.
Cornyn, Texas' senior senator, said security experts backed the need for a wall.

Unlike the use of 'In God We Trust' on money, which is only visible if one makes an affirmative effort to read it, the larger public display of 'In God We Trust' on motor vehicles, alongside bumper stickers and other signage, more clearly makes a statement endorsing the theistic assumptions underlying the phrase, AHA said. The problem, obviously, is that many individuals do not believe in a God, let alone trust in him, her, or it.

Almost immediately after President Trump directed the Pentagon withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria, he ordered a reduction of U.S. forces in Afghanistan—more than 7,000 soldiers, which is about half of the current force. Given the hysterical reaction of Washington's foreign policy establishment about the president's Syria decision, there will certainly be an even more shrill the sky is falling chorus regarding Afghanistan. But whatever one thinks of the president's temperament, his management style, and the decision-making process (or lack thereof), his decision about Syria was the right thing to do, and so is his decision to pull back in Afghanistan. After more than 17 years, it's well past time to wind down America's longest war.

Since Benghazi, when I raised the alarm about a media that was not only willing to blatantly support one political party or one political a candidate but for the first time seemed willing to suppress or ignore the facts and truth as related to a disaster of American foreign policy, my fear has been that we are now on a slippery slope. Almost everything since then has helped to realize that fear. Chuck Hagel, the sequester, Mr. Obama's speeches -- all of these have revealed a mainstream press that has absolutely decided to wear its bias openly as outriders of the Obama administration. Except for one issue -- when the president refused to allow reporters to cover him and Tiger Woods playing golf together. Now that's something they can get riled up about.

ISRAEL BEGINS PUMPING FROM LUCRATIVE MEDITERRANEAN GAS FIELD Lower oil prices cause lower gas prices, which put more money in the pockets of families and consumers. According to economist Stephen Moore, a Job Creators Network board member, every one-cent drop in gas prices puts more than $1 billion a year into the hands of Americans. With gas prices down around $1 to $1.50 since the fracking revolution, Americans have enjoyed the equivalent of a $100 to $150 billion a year economic stimulus.

Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We -- even we here -- hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. – President Abraham Lincoln in a message to Congress, Dec. 1, 1862
In November, Republicans won at least nine of the 13 seats in North Carolina's congressional delegation and appeared to have won a 10th seat, in keeping with how many they held before the 2016 remapping. But state election officials have so far declined to certify the results in the 9th District in south-central North Carolina because of allegations of absentee ballot fraud.

Kristol hasn't changed his views for political expedience, to gain access to the president or to get a job with the Trump administration. The Weekly Standard – the conservative magazine founded by Kristol and Fred Barnes – recently went out of business in large part because Kristol refused to drop the magazine's anti-Trump corporate line.

In 2018, last year, you and most Senate Democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.

Dershowitz proceeded to claim that academics were choosing their position because President Trump was in office. Shortly after the Constitution was enacted, the dean of Columbia Law School said that the weight of authority was in favor of it being a crime, he said.
Much of this is thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has helped push nominees through the Senate, even while combatting House Democrats as they impeach the president.
This is a common complaint from those who claim they are on the no-fly list unjustly. If you have a name which is similar in sound or spelling or in phonetical interpretation to someone who probably legitimately should be on the list, you're at risk for finding yourself on the list, says Mann. He cites a friend of his who shares a last name with an Irish Republican Army operative who was active in the 1960s and 1970s. That unfortunate coincidence, says Mann, landed not only his friend on the list but also the man's son — who wasn't even born during this operative's heyday.

Will some future Congress cross the line from crass pandering and into the actual work of stealing an election? Will the results of some future election be decided not by counting ballots but by the partisan composition of statehouses? Will courts one day cower from angry mobs outside their chambers?
Seventy of Americans believe we are still in the middle of the economic crisis, or that the worst is yet to come. And, I fear they are correct.
Somehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.
Back in Wisconsin, the Marquette men's basketball team wore black uniforms to protest the decision, and the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks said they plan to continue pushing for policy changes in law enforcement.

They're being cheered on by this. They are state-run media and really it's the communication system.
The mention of his supporters having a 'GIANT VOICE long into the future' and that 'They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!' is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition' and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election, Twitter stated.
A day later, Pelosi tweaked her tone, saying she hasn't seen the proposal but knows there's enthusiasm for the Green New Deal, adding it was welcome.

Bolton also called Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warm and cordial, without mentioning any misconduct.

Ned Ryun: This is unreal, Tucker.

I got to say this, Tucker, as a active devout evangelical Christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with Christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors and quite frankly a perverse incentive for these government-funded charities that are acting as refugee contractors grifting off the American taxpayer. Michelle Malkin has written about some of this but the U.S. State Department is paying these refugee contractors over $2,100 per refugee of which they get to keep 45 percent and then they're doing this campaign on these governors saying you have to put your Christian charity into action and in an act of cowardice most of these governors from red states are giving in to this.

He said, he's doing something and this time, I said maybe I'll sit down, because nobody has done more than me. I mean nobody - if you look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything, and all the things, we've rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. Our military was old and depleted. And he said you know you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment, as you know he's slightly covered Nixon and he covered Clinton.

But the real damage is people coming across the border, selling drugs, killing Americans, that needs to come to an end. So, the real damage is a broken border compared to a partial shutdown.
HARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.

The name is Lev Parnas. Lev Parnas could well be the next surprise twist, the surprise witness for the Democrats. I think this is going to be Schiff's next guy. This is the next bombshell, meaning the whistle-blower is no longer necessary. His information has been trumped, so to speak by Lev Parnas.
Sen. Cornyn: Thanks, guy. Happy New Year.
The comments certainly have not endeared him to the Cuban-American community, a once strong Republican voting bloc that has been leaning left in recent years.
But that has nothing to do with what we're --
The Fed claims quantitative easing is to save the economy…when the real goals are printing enough fake money to pay for $3.7 trillion in government handout bribes to Obama's voters…and making billionaire crony capitalists like Warren Buffett far richer last year, by turning Wall Street into a fixed craps game that makes bankers and CEO's filthy rich…while our children and unborn grandchildren owe back trillions in debt. By the way Obama's buddy Warren Buffett made $12.7 billion last year. How'd you do?
Nevertheless, Democrats' sudden about-face has been drawing some light mockery from even left-of-center commentators.
The shooting took place after Wallace responded to a call of an aggressive dog at Shiloh Estates subdivision in Conway, located about 30 miles north of Little Rock.
The report also said that 30 people were documented to know of the shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz's troubling behavior prior to the rampage that killed 17 people at the school, according to Florida's Fox 13.
While the FDA recently approved the first over-the-counter COVID-19 test, the main barriers to widescale rapid testing remain both regulatory and political. Daily testing with easy-to-use, rapid paper-strip tests is the most effective bridge to when we can achieve population-wide immunity.
Josh Holmes: Well, first off, this whole thing is kind of confusing to me, as to why Nancy Pelosi believes that it increases her leverage, by holding the papers. I mean, every day that she holds them, they look more and more bizarre. And the closer and closer that they get to the Iowa caucuses -- which, of course, throws off the closing arguments for every 2020 Democrat running against President Trump, ultimately -- but secondly, she has no leverage here. This is not about trying to control the contours of the Senate. She's never going to be able to do that. So, this ends only one way; and that's when she sends the papers over without any kind of preconditions. That's basically what McConnell said this week.
REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: So this is a very serious matter and we take it to heart in a really solemn way.
BORDER CRISIS INTENSIFIES AMID SHUTDOWN: MASSIVE INCREASE IN FAMILY UNITS CROSSED BORDER ILLEGALLY IN 2018

De Blasio's announcement came after California's new Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined a similarly ambitious health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting ObamaCare. Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, up from 19, according to Newsom's new agenda.
This policy is yet another way for the Trump administration to hurt immigrants, said Claudia Center, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Disability Rights Program, said Monday. It enshrines the false stereotype that people with disabilities do not contribute to our society. Families will suffer. Congress has repeatedly declared that disability discrimination violates federal law. This rule must be stopped.
It's not what it says. Donald Trump broke the law, they say. Well, if Donald Trump broke the law, as they point out in PJ Media today, well, then so did Joe Biden.

This is a common complaint from those who claim they are on the no-fly list unjustly. If you have a name which is similar in sound or spelling or in phonetical interpretation to someone who probably legitimately should be on the list, you're at risk for finding yourself on the list, says Mann. He cites a friend of his who shares a last name with an Irish Republican Army operative who was active in the 1960s and 1970s. That unfortunate coincidence, says Mann, landed not only his friend on the list but also the man's son — who wasn't even born during this operative's heyday.

Authoritarian regimes have used walls to keep their populations in. During the Cold War, the communist German Democratic Republic constructed the Berlin Wall to separate East Berlin from West Berlin at least as much to keep their own residents in as their Western foes out. The same may be true of the barriers along the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula, which, in addition to its military function, serves to keep North Koreans from defecting.
Thankfully, the president recently held a news conference with several Border Patrol officials, giving them a chance to tell the public about the critical need for physical barriers at the border.

But, until then, Democrats have a policy agenda to push. They've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. And they have an election to win. If they want to beat Donald Trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. They've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. That should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.

LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham. This is the Ingraham Angle from Washington, tonight. The Senate might not be starting their trial today but the President is wasting no time. Ari Fleischer, Tom Fitton and Matt Whitaker are going to break down the new members of his legal team, the strategy that they're going to be employing. Why Democrats may come to regret demanding witnesses? We got a lot to unpack. Also tonight, top 2020 Democrats, they're struggling. Hillary Clinton's new documentary, and another Biden looks to cash in on sleeping Uncle Joe. Well, Eric Trump is here to react to that and how long can Democrats deny the advancement for Black America under Trump and just how much of the vote of African-Americans could Trump capture? Herman Cain and Leo Terrell, oh my goodness, I cannot wait for this. They're going to debate this new Wall Street journal piece, it's making a lot of waves and it's Friday so you know Raymond Roy is here. We got the Oscars. Apparently they're too white and to male. And also plus hypocrisy of course out completely out of control plus Prince Harry's embarrassing groveling to the Disney boss, all caught on tape, we'll get all of that but first. As the Senate jockeys over the rules for next week's impeachment trial, the President today announced his defense team and it's stacked with some serious legal minds.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called to invoke the 25th after pro-Trump rioters clashed with security and forced their way into the Capitol during a joint session to certify the presidential results. Trump had spoken to the group hours before, vowing he would never concede.

When those cases did not settle the issue, the high court ordered the three judges to take a new look at their earlier decision. They reaffirmed the ruling in August, but also concluded there wasn't enough time to put new districts in place for 2018.
I will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put a bill on the floor that was adopted unanimously by the Senate at the end of last year that would have kept the government open and supported 1.3 billion in border security. The president reversed position the next day and rejected something he told Mitch McConnell he would sign.

The mandate forces individuals to purchase health care coverage or pay a fee that the Supreme Court described in 2012 as a tax, rather than a penalty that would have run afoul of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Last month, though, a federal judge in Texas ruled the individual mandate no longer was a constitutional exercise of Congress' taxing power because Republicans had passed legislation eliminating the tax entirely -- a move, the judge said, that rendered the entire health-care law unworkable.
The controversial study, which was issued in July, found that a big factor in the senior care contagion was infection introduced by staff and visitors, since cases at the facilities were already spreading before infected patients were received.

VAN DREW: But I want her to know that we're all thinking about her. Secondly, to answer your question, look, the House had its time. They have spent months and months and months of reports, of investigations, millions upon millions of dollars. And we finally, the House, came up with two articles of impeachment, both of which are very weak. I will say this, and I will say it over and over again, because I think people must understand how important it is. Impeachment is a tool that is not meant to be used anywhere near a regular basis. Our founding fathers almost disliked it. It was said even by de Tocqueville, who was a famous Frenchman who loved America, that, when impeachment was used too often, that it was a sign of the degeneration of the country and the breakdown of the United States of America.
The future of construction at the border is unclear. President-elect Joe Biden opposed wall construction and has promised that there will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration.
Truman also ignored manufactured polls. During his 1948 campaign, which the press predicted Truman was supposed to lose, someone yelled out from the crowd he was addressing, Give 'em hell Harry! which became a rallying cry.

According to FM3-24, the U.S. Army's counterinsurgency manual, Twenty counterinsurgents per 1000 residents is often considered the minimum troop density required for effective COIN [counterinsurgency] operations. With a population of over 33 million, a force of 660,000 troops would be needed in Afghanistan. For a sense of scale, the total U.S. Army active duty force is less than 500,000 soldiers. It's also worth noting that peak U.S. troop deployment during the Vietnam War was more than 500,000 soldiers and we did not win that counterinsurgent operation.
We have been misinformed and misled by generations of public policy, education, and media leaders on the so-called 'separation of church and state,' Pritchett wrote. The concept has been so pervasive that we generally accept the idea that it is inappropriate to bring any faith-based ideas to the public square. The idea that we should separate religion — of any faith or denomination — from politics is not only false, it is virtually impossible.

But—however desirable a representative, multiethnic, democratic government in Afghanistan would be—it is not an absolute necessity for U.S. national security. The overriding requirement is that whatever government controls Afghanistan, it understands that the United States will not tolerate support for or the harboring of any terrorist group with global reach that directly threatens the United States—even if such a government is not a friendly government. Al Qaeda and ISIS are terrorist threats in Afghanistan, but neither are a direct, existential threat to the American homeland.

Americans also benefit from lower energy costs beyond just the price of gas. Economists suggest that for energy to be considered affordable, it must cost less than six percent of household income. Lower energy costs mean less energy poverty for Americans on fixed incomes. Contrast this energy wealth to the situation in other industrialized nations such as Great Britain, where thousands of pensioners die each winter because they cannot afford to adequately heat their homes. Oil is an input cost on all goods, whether it is used directly in the production process as in the case of plastics or indirectly through transport costs such as with Florida oranges. Lower costs of basic goods help keep inflation low which disproportionately benefits price-sensitive shoppers.

Joining us now is Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus and author of Guilt by Accusation. Along with him is Greg Jarrett, Fox News Legal Analyst and author of Witch Hunt.
GREEN: So far every action he's taken has been spectacular, from cutting taxes that created massive growth at least in our state in Tennessee, to one of the biggest pay raises for our veterans -- our soldiers in -- in ten plus years. You know, I -- I think the actions that he's taken are spectacular and I can't see an area where I would disagree with him at this point.
So, today, Ellison got some valuable face time in with President Trump, along with donors, some who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to golf with the president.
HARMAN: Yes, well, and 800,000 of them are out of work because of it.

WALLACE: I'm not talking about --
WALLACE: So what are you saying, the deal should be some money for the wall, something between $1 billion and $5 billion in return for some concessions on people in this country illegally, like dreamers and the temporary protected status refugees?
Congressman Chaffetz, you were -- are a former congressman from Utah. What do you make of -- of Mitt Romney, before he is even sworn in, having an op- ed in The Washington Post that -- that basically says this president is living -- not living up to his responsibilities as president, certainly in the image department, and what's the reaction been back home?
The sweeping arrests drew condemnation from Anthony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State nominee for the upcoming Biden administration, who said on Twitter that it was an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights.
Fox News has lots of great coverage of the Georgia runoffs ahead of Tuesday's conclusion (though the actual counting may go on much longer – sorry) and we will be back before the polls close with our full analysis of the race. If you'd like some great context and deep background, Chris joined Abby Hornacek on her latest Getting Schooled podcast to talk about the peculiar history and details of this week's runoffs.
Cuomo, a Democrat, raised eyebrows when he announced that he was already writing a memoir about how he handled the outbreak in New York. The book, titled American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic, was released in October.
That's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and very soon unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.
Danon: We have the idea of reentering the agreement and then negotiating with the Iranians. This is a mistake. That's not how you handle business. You don't enter the agreement and then negotiate. You do it in advance before you enter the agreement and I hope that will be the approach. And once there will be negotiations then I think we should be discussing a number of issues that are problematic. First is the issue of enriching uranium, which we just got a public announcement by Tehran that they are enriching to a level of 20% and from 20% it's really easy to jump to higher levels that will lead you to a nuclear bomb.
ROVE: Look, here's the bottom line --
This is striking because rural Americans wouldn't seem to have much in common with anyone from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly.
Raphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, they would be rubber-stamps for defunding the
Roughly 420,000 employees were deemed essential and have been working unpaid. An additional 380,000 were staying home without pay. On Thursday afternoon, after assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that President Trump would sign the bill, the Senate passed legislation to provide back pay for furloughed federal workers.

GOODSTEIN: So I think, you know, you could show a lot of gaffes about Joe Biden. You could have done the same thing if you covered him decades ago. This is him.
Chris Wallace: Despite the popularity of home streaming, movie theaters remain packed. The domestic box office for 2019 is projected to be more than $11 billion. And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next Fox News Sunday.
The contentious debate over immigration policy was thrust back into the spotlight last year as massive migrant caravans tried to make their way through Central America in a bid to enter the U.S. Meanwhile, a zero-tolerance policy instituted by the Trump administration's Justice Department, which led to nearly 2,000 children being temporarily separated from their families after being caught trying to cross the U.S. border, also sparked a national outcry.
Charles Rivkin: He talked about his story, the American story. He's the embodiment of the American dream.

TERRELL: Yes, 15 percent, I will do it. I will do whatever you want.
It's so humiliating that I personally couldn't do it.
Los Angeles Times, James Riady, another longtime friend of President Clinton, who heads the worldwide Lippo Banking Group, pleaded guilty. He was involved.
Following his lead, the state Legislature required public school students' weights to be assessed using the BMI, or Body Mass Index, scale. It also formed an advisory panel to institute a campaign to target rising childhood obesity rates in the state.
Beijing also blasted the primaries as illegal, calling it a serious provocation of Hong Kong's electoral system.
Kevin Corke: Chris, the Iraqi parliament convenes an extraordinary session this Sunday. They're considering whether to ask the U.S. to withdraw troops from their country. Now that consideration comes just a couple of days after that American drone strike took out an Iranian general on Iraqi soil, sparking fears of a wider regional conflict. [begin video clip]
WALLACE: Congresswoman, congressman, thank you both.
We have to wait and see what happens with the Mueller report, Pelosi said. We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason. We have to see.
Wednesday, but it will happen this week. The articles have been drawn up.
Gentlemen, great discussion. Thank you so much, all of you.
Trump wished Mattis well in the retired Marine general's return to private life after two tumultuous years leading the Pentagon. But Trump also took a swipe at the man he had approvingly called Mad Dog Mattis when he hired him shortly after winning election in 2016.
Pompeo made clear in his remarks at American University that he understands that radical Islamists – like the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS and the rulers of Iran – continue to support terrorism and promote enmity between religions.
CAVUTO: It is stunning. And they had the whole thing redecorated and done for them.
The State of California says the potential for transmission of the virus is negligible, but residents are vowing to fight on and the mayor wonders why the Fairview Center is suddenly appropriate to house coronavirus patients when just last week, the state said it was not adequate to house the homeless -- Tucker.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president wants to cut a deal.
Dan Eberhart, a major GOP donor and bundler who helped raise money for the president, told Fox News that this is a failure of leadership. If President Trump wants to have any kind of political future within the Republican Party, he needs to condemn the violence at the Capitol and stop claiming the election was stolen.
That conundrum will confront Democratic kingmakers again and again as they try to whittle down this massive field. If Trump, who had no experience in public service, can win why not someone with a lengthy background even if it's not on a national level?
INGRAHAM: Her impeachment managers. They have a name--
There was also an expectation, and, again, rational hope, that changes taking place in the Republic of Cuba would continue but, more importantly, would increase in velocity, Kavulich said to Fox News. The transition from the Castro administration to the Diaz-Canel administration would bring a new dynamic.
PELOSI REPORTEDLY INTERRUPTS DHS SECRETARY: 'I REJECT YOUR FACTS'
I received information from a former Department of Homeland Security official who had security clearances. He just retired in April, Mitchell said. He contacted me and he contacted Judicial Watch and some members of Congress and said there is backup material.
In Afghanistan, we had thousands of combat soldiers operating from dozens of forward operating bases along the nearly 1,500-mile Pakistan border with the sole mission of preventing infiltration through means of killing or capturing the enemy. We employed every available technology—drones, ground sensors, multiple intelligence methods—and to be sure, our troops killed and captured significant numbers of enemy, but not all. Those that made it through, fought to destabilize progress in Afghanistan.
SANDERS: As we've said for the last several weeks, we're looking and exploring every option available that the president has, whether --
Any witness resolution would likely require four Republican defections in the Senate, because in the event of a 50-50 tie, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts is highly likely to abstain rather than assert his debatable power to cast a tie-breaking vote.

America. It's what separates him from all the other nations on the Earth.
I know your pain, I know your hurt, said Trump, in a taped video that was tweeted and subsequently deleted. We had an election that was stolen from us, he said, in the video. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.

Pence furious - Tulsa [Okla.] World: [U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe] hedged on who he thought might be to blame for what happened [Wednesday], but he allowed that Trump did not do enough to stop it. … Instead, Trump directed his disdain toward Vice President Mike Pence… By doing so, he may have alienated one of his most steadfast allies. 'I've known Mike Pence forever,' Inhofe said Tuesday night. 'I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today.' 'I had a long conversation with him,' said Inhofe. 'He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump).'' Aside from Wednesday's attempted takeover of the Capitol, the past few days have been difficult for Inhofe because he refused to go along with protesting the Electoral College results. 'We've had calls. We've had threats. … I have many very, very close friends mad at me, when all I'm doing is upholding my oath,' Inhofe said.
We're stigmatizing people who choose to infect someone else with HIV. And they say, well, you know, Science and Medicine is so much different now that you can take a one a day pill, and you're basically going to be okay. So it's not that big of a deal to have HIV. That's their argument, which of course, there's certainly truth to the point of Medicine and how it's no longer the death sentence it once was.
In November, after a group of migrants tried to rush the border, McAleenan defended the use of tear gas: As the events unfolded, quick, decisive and effective action prevented an extremely dangerous situation.
The Obama era guidance was the result of lobbying by liberal activists who portray sexual assault on campus as an exploding crisis and insist that all accusers must be believed, while dismissing inconsistencies or untruths in an accuser's story as the understandable result of trauma - a theme that should sound familiar to those who followed the Kavanaugh saga. The guidance pressured schools to deny basic due process protections to the accused, while also mandating the lowest possible standard of proof—under which a 50 percent chance of guilt means conviction—and defining sexual misconduct so broadly that it infringed on free speech.
HARF: It became reality and not just words on a platform. And I think
And Democratic darling Beto O'Rourke, who was narrowly defeated by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in the midterm elections, is apparently supportive of the concept.
In a recent survey of American teens, 27 percent of teens admitted playing Fortnite in the classroom. That proportion is likely higher for boys than for girls. Boys and young men playing Fortnite outnumber girls and young women roughly two to one. Among devoted gamers – those playing more than 20 hours a week – the boy-to-girl ratio is even higher.

And, finally, Jason, what do you think Tuesday comes down to here?
MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: It does seem that they're having trouble sticking with a particular narrative when it comes to Soleimani, Iran. First, they're telling us it's no big deal. Then they're highlighting the people who are mourning his death. They said that Trump doing this might have been a wag the dog effort to distract from impeachment. Last week supposedly he couldn't wait for impeachment, which is why Nancy Pelosi had such leverage. They can't stick with a particular storyline and it's making them looking like the only thing that they are consistent, and it is what they're consistent about, is opposition to Trump.

He needs arms and legs to execute what he wants and he doesn't need people telling him, for example, that we don't need the wall we can do it with drones or technology. They need to execute the policy that the president of the United States sets down.
Gomez said Sanders' rhetoric is not only offensive, it's personal. Her family left Cuba in the 1970s, and they came to Florida after being among the few lucky Cubans to take Freedom Flights to Spain.
If their first few days in the majority is any indication, we can look forward to two years of Democratic overreach and radical policy proposals driven exclusively by their animosity toward the president, rather than the will of the people or the good of the country.
RANTZ: Yes, from their perspective, they see a victim class that this is being pushed by social justice Democrats, who see people living with HIV as victims that are in need of protection.

Censorship, wokeness, political correctness, it all points in one direction – authoritarianism, cloaked as moral righteousness, Pompeo said. It's similar to what we're seeing at Twitter, and Facebook, and Apple, and on too many university campuses. This is not who we are, as Americans. It's not what Voice of America should be. It's time to put woke-ism to sleep.

In the clip, a fan of the president claimed another traveler threatened to kill the supporters on the plane as yelling continued back and forth. Footage of the fight has since gone viral on Twitter; the user who posted the clip alleged that cabin crew was struggling to control the scene.
I do believe this will be the beginning of the downfall of social media as we know it, Toscano said. I don't think social media is going away, I think what's going to happen is between this stuff which will get us deep into Section 230, the antitrust cases and all this other litigation being brought up against Big Tech, I do think we are going to see the downfall of these companies. There is a giant net being cast over these companies that is going to drag them down.
Despite voting as a member of the high court a year earlier to allow a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton to proceed -- which set the subsequent impeachment process in motion -- there was no real objection to having Rehnquist preside. The Paula Jones case led to Clinton being tried over perjury and obstruction of justice, for his later statements made under oath where he denied an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday that the district attorney's office, under Boudin's leadership, dismissed previous criminal strikes against McAlister and agreed to the five years he had already served for a 2015 robbery.

Medicare-for-all in particular is quickly picking up support. A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls. Such proposals would lead to more government involvement in health care, and bring the U.S. a step closer to mostly socialized systems such as the British National Health Service. Their popularity is driven by frustration with the current private insurance system, which remains costly on the individual market despite ObamaCare's goals. And while Medicare-for-all is estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, advocates argue some of this would replace out-of-pocket expenses already being shouldered by millions of Americans.

Instead, they were simply trying to undermine a president they didn't like and avenge Comey's firing.

Bernie, for all his craziness, is nevertheless authentic. In fact, this is one characteristic he shares with Trump. People who meet Trump, people who encounter Trump, say this guy is real, he's the real deal. He is what he is. Bernie is what he is. Now, I don't like what he is. I just read an article about how Bernie was thrown out of a commune because he didn't want to do any work. He wanted to talk about politics all day. The commune was all about self-sufficiency, growing your own food. So Bernie is making the case for being a bum, and there's a little bit of us that wants to do that. We don't want to get off the couch, we don't want to go to work. So there is a little bit of us that is Bernie, and I think that's the secret of Bernie's appeal.

But there is a more profound reason that Romney lost to Obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. While President Trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), Romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. Maybe he thought American voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.

That's a cliche the Democratic and Republican political animals use all the time, a firewall that will give him momentum going into Super Tuesday to make or break contest. At least that was the plan. At this point, it's not even clear Biden knows what office he is running for.
Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and many other places and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal.
But if it turns out and the Republican base sees that this looks like only Democrat witnesses and no presidential witnesses, I guarantee that the Republican base will punish those people who set off that kind of scenario.

As I have been saying for a long time, Twitter has gone further and further in banning free speech, and tonight, Twitter employees have coordinated with the Democrats and the Radical Left in removing my account from their platform, to silence me — and YOU, the 75,000,000 great patriots who voted for me, the president tweeted from the @Potus account instead of his personal @ReadDonaldTrump -- which he almost exclusively used before the ban.
INGRAHAM: But you see Chuck Schumer reading those comments. I mean he's been in Senate for like decades. He should read his comments. He knows what he thinks, doesn't he or does he not? What do you think? When he's on the Sunday shows. Very odd.
That isn't to say that many Republican voters don't regret Romney's defeat. The former Massachusetts governor would have been a much better president than Barack Obama, given his considerable management expertise and profound understanding of the economy.

But first. last week was a big one for The Ingraham Angle. We not only had two news making interviews with the President and the Secretary of State, but we also shattered the liberal media narrative that Nancy Pelosi was some sort of political mastermind of strategy.
Beverly Hallberg joins us, The Independent Women's forum, and Jason Nichols, the Democratic strategist.
WALLACE: So why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?
SPALDING: We spent billions on MRAPs and we never did a thing about the IEDs that were the cause of having to build those MRAPs.
His raging, lecturing routine has no place in the Biden press corps. The transition from rabid lion to Poppin Fresh would have been stunning. What we're to get now is repeaters, not reporters, Graham told Fox News. The liberal networks say they won't be 'stenographers to power,' but that's exactly what they sound like most of the time when they are covering Democrats.
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Intelligence and Security
No, because then we give up, and that's not American, Chabot says.
When it comes to climate change, we need to advance policies that don't ask Americans to choose between their jobs and clean air and water, Swalwell told Fox News this week. We can do that by greening the grid with investments in renewable energy and a wage and skills guarantee for any displaced worker.
Well, Karl, let's start with the new wrinkle this week, can the president declare a national emergency to build the wall, should he declare a national emergency to build the wall?

Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other.
SEN. JEFF MERKLEY (D-OR): They're going to have to search their heart and ask if they're able to set aside their preconceptions, all of us, all 100 of us and if we are unable to do that, if we're unable to in good faith say we'll set aside our preconceptions, look at the exact language of the House articles of impeachment, the exact evidence and how it fits, then we should recuse ourselves.
This entire impeachment gambit, it's just been an embarrassing failure from day one. So naturally, she's lashing out at Trump. Here's how she reacted when ABC's George Stephanopoulos showed her a clip from our interview.

WBRC: Why did the chicken tenders cross the road? Apparently to cause a traffic hazard, according to Cherokee County authorities. No, seriously. It's not a joke. The Cherokee County EMA is asking drivers to not eat the chicken fingers left on Highway 35 in a late Sunday night Facebook post. The tenders spilled on the roadway during an 18-wheeler wreck. The cases, which have been on the ground for 24 hours, aren't safe to eat, authorities warn. What's worse? Diving for free chicken tenders could land you in hot water with the law. It's a crime to impede traffic, according to the EMA. Anyone caught could face charges.
The chief justice responded, We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.
Tucker Carlson: That's right. It's exactly right. I mean, that's the difference in the parties. When Democratic primary voters want something, their party gives it to them. When Republican voters say they want something, their party gives them the finger and ignores them.
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Great to be with you.
Facebook Vice President Guy Rosen, upon the platform's removal of the video, initially said: This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video.

American Airlines has suspended liquor sales on flights in and out of Washington, D.C., after Trump supporters chaotically stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in protests that turned violent.

He added: Christianity may be the fastest growing religion in Iran, a fact which worries a regime fanatical about its ability to enforce a rigid conformity.

The problem is that socialist theory provides no checks and balances in socialism to keep the ideology from devolving into what Churchill called the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy.

Regardless of what transpires, negotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.
An October 2000 memo stated that the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.
I have been an outspoken supporter of President Trump since the early days of his first presidential campaign.

Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful! Trump tweeted.
I don't want to have to stand up to try and fight for recognition, Paul shouted, according to reporter Niels Lesniewski, who noted that Paul's complaint was audible from the galleries above the chamber.
Plus, President Trump has a way of revealing folks, doesn't he? For who they really are. Mollie Hemingway, Mike Huckabee, they're going to tell us how the Left and the media are now defending the world's largest state- sponsor of terrorism. I thought I'd seen it all until the last few days.
Tucker Carlson: Johnny Joey Jones is a veteran of the war in Iraq, he lost his legs to an IED there. Soleimani is believed to have masterminded hundreds of IED attacks during the U.S. occupation of this country, so we thought it'd be interesting to speak to Jones. He joins us tonight. Johnny, thanks so much for coming on. You have a very personal connection to this story of course. We just explained it. So, I'm interested in your reaction to what happened yesterday.
So they claim ObamaCare is about saving the sick and uninsured…when the real objective is income redistribution (through higher taxes and higher premiums) to make the middle class poor and dependent on government.

INGRAHAM: California, we have to walk across the hypodermic needles and the homeless crisis to actually find people to interview, Leo, and you know that is the case.

The longest shutdown occured in 1995 under President Clinton, when the federal government was shuttered for 21 days. The current shutdown would surpass that record on Saturday, and federal workers would miss their first full paycheck on Friday.

Iran, I think is a problem for the U.S. and its allies in the region. But it is not an existential threat, like China or Russia. China or Russia, particularly China would love to see another decade or two of Americans my age, dying in the sand for no particular purpose.
TRUMP: We're doing great. Our country is doing great, our economy is doing great.
My prayer for America is that people from all over the political spectrum would find freedom from slavery to bitterness and anger today.
But what was worse, Florin said, was having to buy her own flag, then learning that officials were not permitted to attend because of a back-up at the crematory. The family needed to return to the East Coast.

And el-Sissi did something of great symbolic importance that no other Egyptian leader had done before him – he attended a Christmas Eve service in Cairo alongside the Coptic Orthodox pope.
The president went on to say he had predicted his words would be censored. Conservatives have long been complaining that social media sites like Twitter are biased against them in favor of liberals.
Dems, right now, they can't stand in a gymnasium and count who stands under which sign and they're the ones that want to be in charge of our healthcare and everything else in our life, Cruz told Fox & Friends.
And we're back now with the panel.
The desecration of the Capitol is not going to be forgotten, Eberhart emphasized. He cost Senate Majority Leader (Mitch) McConnell his leadership position and now he's shitting all over the Capitol – I think that's a pretty strong statement about how President Trump feels about the Republican Party.
INGRAHAM: Hold on. No, not for blue-collar workers. It didn't. and the fact is liberal economists have said consistently that Trump is doing OK, but it will really matter when blue-collar workers get wage increases. Sure enough, lower and middle-class workers have seen significant wage increases under this administration. And if you are going to tell me that that doesn't help some minority voters, then I don't understand how you're claiming factual understanding.

Here in Nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow Nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where I'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.
So that lane remains clogged up. I think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the Democratic nomination. Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.

I saw [the suspect] try to un-holster [the trooper's] gun, I was like 'oh yeah, we can't have that', knowing the conditions outside we're on the side of the freeway too, I didn't know if his hands were wet or anything, if he gets his gun it could be me and the trooper that are gone... you know,' Williams continued.

Biden reportedly will name R.I. governor to lead Commerce - WSJ: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo as his commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California economic development official, to lead the Small Business Administration, according to people familiar with the matter.

If the polling is an accurate portrait, likely an 'exasperation factor' contributed to the increase in those supporting the 'embargo,' said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, Inc., in New York. From December, 2014 through November, 2016, there was an expectation, perhaps more of a rational hope, that the Obama administration changes to the bilateral commercial, economic and political relationship with the Republic of Cuba would continue through [a Hillary] Clinton administration. That was faulty thinking because of the outcome of the election.

President Trump is the voice of the American people. The press represents an elite who loathe the very word. They denigrate President Trump as a 'populist,' a word derived from the Latin word for the people.'
And that's -- I think you have to worry about egging and being condescending. Secondly, how hard are they going to go after him, when they all want his money? Even Bernie Sanders didn't say that he wouldn't take that $2 billion that Bloomberg is promising to spend, no matter who wins.

The amount of people that are coming forward, saying, listen, these people do not represent us anymore. We can't relate to these people and you know people see it for what it is. My father's signing trade deals with China. He's signing USMCA. He's signing all these great deals. We've got the greatest economy in the history of the world. We've got the lowest unemployment that we've ever had. You know, 401Ks are through the roof. I can go on and on and on and she's sitting behind a desk trying to impeach him because she knows that none of the candidates that we were just talking about before, can actually beat him, right? So this is their 'Hail Mary.' They're trying to throw a ball up. They know they're probably going to fumble it, at the end of the day. They know they're not going to win because you know no one on that stage actually has any sparkle. They don't have any twinkle in their eyes. They don't have any charisma.
We need to act on climate change and a Green New Deal, which is broadly defined as combining policies that reduce emissions and help people economically, is a smart approach. I am less interested in slogans and branding than I am in real policies, which is what I'm running on. The details really matter., Delaney said in a statement to Fox News. The best start is the bipartisan one I introduced in Congress with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICD) - a carbon tax with revenues going back to the American people through a dividend. This plan can result in a 90% reduction in GHG by 2050 by changing behavior, encouraging innovation in new technologies and using market forces to reduce emissions.

I will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place.

JUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's pretty clear right now, if you look at the polls this morning, that the president and Republicans are being blamed overwhelmingly for shutting down the government. And as Chris Coons pointed out to you this morning, Chris, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans had a unanimous support, Republicans and Democrats, for a bill that would have opened the government, kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward. It's the president who has made it a point to say, I'm shutting down this government over the wall.

Should the White House move forward with an emergency declaration, it has a handful of legal routes to take.

Further, there was a failure to follow up on President Trump's success with Latino voters and win the same share for the two senators (this would almost have been enough of a difference to decide the two runoffs).

Transportation secretary to resign in protest - USA Today: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will resign from her position, she announced Thursday. Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is the first Cabinet secretary to resign after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to halt the counting of Electoral College votes. 'Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,' Chao said in a statement. 'As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.' Chao noted her office would continue to help Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for transportation secretary, transition into his role.
REP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: No, I don't think we are demanding a surrender, but what we're demanding is that the government be reopened. We passed appropriations bill that were passed unanimously by the Senate. They were supported by Republicans. There was an agreement on those bills.

He was consistent in my conversation on August 31st and talking to John Bolton, making the same point. So, I don't know what else he would add. But the House obviously didn't make their case, so they're hoping that the Senate will make the case for them. That's not our job.

Be best: Biden tells friends nobody in Dem field can top him - NYT: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in the final stages of deciding whether to run for president and has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat President Trump, an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. Many Democratic voters, and nearly all major Democratic donors, are keenly interested in Mr. Biden's plans because of their consuming focus on finding a candidate who can beat a president they believe represents a threat to American democracy. But there is also a rising demand in the party for a more progressive standard-bearer who reflects the increasingly diverse Democratic coalition. Mr. Biden would instantly be the early front-runner if he ran, but he would have to bridge divides in a primary…

Oil independence was a fantasy as recently as a decade ago, when the experts were warning of peak oil. In 2011, former President Barack Obama said, The United States of America cannot afford to bet our long-term prosperity, our long-term security, on a resource [oil] that will eventually run out. The biggest benefits of energy independence, however, are economic. The U.S. energy production bonanza is responsible for significantly reducing energy prices, with the price of oil falling by about one third over the last decade, adjusted for inflation. At the most basic level, lower energy prices mean better economic prospects for ordinary Americans and small businesses.

I like him a lot, but he didn't want to touch that. I'm telling you; this Iran thing has been brewing for so long, it's been happening for deadly consequences.

You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.'

The Obama era guidance was the result of lobbying by liberal activists who portray sexual assault on campus as an exploding crisis and insist that all accusers must be believed, while dismissing inconsistencies or untruths in an accuser's story as the understandable result of trauma - a theme that should sound familiar to those who followed the Kavanaugh saga. The guidance pressured schools to deny basic due process protections to the accused, while also mandating the lowest possible standard of proof—under which a 50 percent chance of guilt means conviction—and defining sexual misconduct so broadly that it infringed on free speech.

But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.

Tucker Carlson: Well, if you can remember that far back during President Barack Obama's second term, Republican leaders in the Congress made a big show of opposing the Obama administration's refugee policy. Obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled Syria's civil war in the United States and at the time 25 Republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. Now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. For example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. Often, it's impossible. Some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be Syrian. That was true for sure in Europe with the refugees. Some of them might be Islamic extremists. But terrorism was not the only worry they had. America's middle class is in decline. We already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. The last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. That's just true. And anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. As with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. So, before she became the most anti-American member of Congress, Ilhan Omar was a refugee. So, at the time the Republican governors got their wish and President Trump won the 2016 election.

U.S. and European leaders should publicize the plight of Christians as much as possible. The Europeans are lagging in this regard as they assume that the state of instability in Iran may somehow still be resolved by preserving JCPOA [the Iran nuclear deal] and counting on so-called Iranian reformists, who in reality are totally powerless.
COONS: I think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.

CRUZ: Well, that's right. It's kind of strange how we got here. So Democrats have been having hearings, have been doing impeachment for months in the House. They brought in all sorts of witnesses. They blocked the minority from having any witnesses. And then, as soon as we get to the Senate, the Democratic talking point is, we want more witnesses. Never mind all the witnesses they called before. They want yet more. And they're trying to delay this. They're trying to drag this out. They want this trial to go on forever, because they have a political objective of attacking the president. What I have said and what I have urged the conference is, is, listen, if we go down the road of witnesses, we're not going to do what the House did. We're not going to have a one-sided kangaroo court. Instead, we're going to respect reciprocity. What does that mean? That means, if the prosecution gets a witness, the defense gets a witness. If the prosecution gets two, the defense gets two. That means, if the prosecution gets to call John Bolton, then the president gets to call Hunter Biden. And I got to tell you, the Democrats are terrified about seeing a witness like Hunter Biden testify, because they don't want to hear evidence of actual corruption, of corruption, potentially, of Joe Biden, corruption that occurred during the Obama administration. They blocked all those witnesses in the House. They're not going to succeed in blocking them in the Senate.

I've been talking to the people who have the responsibility of implementing this deal and they're all over it.
Everyone wins when we adopt strong clean car standards as our public policy, said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense Fund.

WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.
WALLACE: The president said on Friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from Sarah Sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. If he goes ahead and does that, what will House Democrats like yourself do?
WALLACE: I didn't say he didn't. I'm saying, what does he think is his authority?
GRAHAM: They should have thought of that before they changed the rules. They try to destroy conservative judges. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan understanding what I was getting. So this decision by Reid and Schumer may come back to haunt them, but I am dead set on making sure it is a conservative nominee.
This quickly earned him a presidential tweet: Republicans have pluses & minuses, but one thing is sure, THEY NEVER FORGET! The clear implication is that Cotton would be punished at the polls when he runs for reelection. Maybe the New York Times, which fired its editorial page editor for running a Cotton op-ed, would now be more receptive to a piece by the senator.
Carl Icahn: China is very important to the whole economy.
Although multiple elected Republicans have raised concerns about what they claim are ballot irregularities, Trump did not win the election, let alone by a landslide. On Thursday, Congress certified the Electoral College results, validating President-Elect Biden's spot in the White House.
It's not OK. This author was just notified by his health insurance company that my family's policy has been cancelled. Because of the lies of ObamaCare my family will have no insurance.

In Maryland, Democratic Rep. David Trone was sworn into office Thursday to represent a district that runs from the Washington suburbs to the rural northwest corner of the state.

When I speak to parents' groups about kids who are addicted to Fortnite and other video games, I tell them that it is the parents' job to limit, govern and guide their kids' use of video games -- to help their kids develop good habits instead of bad habits. One response I often hear from parents is, Shouldn't I give my son the freedom to make mistakes? It's not like he's going to be driving while intoxicated. It's just a video game. I think good parenting means letting kids decide.

Former presidential favorite Joe Biden still hasn't won anything in the race so far, but he is counting on South Carolina to be his firewall.
The reaction of liberal activists outside Congress was similar. These changes are designed to flip Title IX on its head and give rights to accused students when Title IX was supposed to be protecting those experiencing sexual discrimination, said Carly Mee, an attorney for a survivors advocacy group SurvJustice. Putting aside Mee's mistaken belief that Title IX protects only accusers, it is a shame that critics of the proposed rules see the investigation and adjudication of sexual assault allegations as a choice between protecting women and affording due process to the accused.
Warren, who is currently sitting in third in most national polls behind former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen.

We build runways that are 15,000 feet long at LaGuardia, they're 7000 feet long. In fact, I think they're 20,000 feet long over there and deep thick concrete and steel. Nobody ever built runways like this. OK, it's way overbuilt, but that's OK. But we have billions of dollars into that. I said if we leave, you've got to pay us. If we leave, you have to pay us for embassies, you have to pay us for the money we put in.

Asked whether he intends to follow in Ford's footsteps to the White House, Meijer brushed off the notion, saying it was just one of a couple of hundred domains he registered to own his name.
Here's the problem, the War Powers Act is not covered under that. This is a president taking a self-defense action for our country, taking it directly to our enemy, taking it directly to someone who previous administrations said was a terrorist and was committing terrorist acts. He was not even supposed to be out of Iran. Think about this, under the old agreement, he was not even supposed to be traveling around like he was.

Successful properties will be ones that are able to offer guests added flexibility by way of 100% refunds for last-minute cancellations, along with other risk-reducing policies. Having a flexible cancelation policy on a hotel website will be vital in ensuring direct bookings, and these relaxed policies will continue in 2021. For example, Marriott International has just extended its 24-hour global cancelation policy through March 31, 2021.

Now two years later, Obama was elected in part on his promise to pull us out of Iraq. Of course, Obama took a completely different approach. He made things worse. He thought that as long as we ended combat operations in Iraq, we could bribe Iran to get better behavior from Iran. So, the $1.7 billion was the settlement of a decades old arbitration claim between the U.S. and Iran. An initial 400 million of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency was delivered on pallets, January 17th. Now that's the same day, Tehran agreed to release four American prisoners.

While Lankford did not say the truth that Joe Biden had won the presidency, he did say that Biden needed to start receiving intelligence briefings immediately as part of a potential transition.
Tucker Carlson: Threats in the region. If you don't live in Washington, here's the translation. That would be in hostile middle eastern countries, places where American troops would never be in the first place were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like Max Boot [spelled phonetically] and John Bolton. But nevermind. No one in Washington is in the mood for big picture questions right now. Questions, the obvious ones, like is Iran really the greatest threat we face and who's actually benefiting from this and why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit? By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan 19 years -- sad years later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran? And so on. Nobody is thinking like that right now. Instead, chest beaters like Senator Ben Sass of Nebraska are making the usual war-like noises, the ones they always make. This is very simple, Ben Sasse wrote in a statement last night, General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans, which is essentially true. Soleimani was certainly a bad guy but does that make killing him very simple? It does not. Nothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever very simple and any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. Yes, Soleimani was linked to the deaths of Americans. Nobody mourns his passing.

Let's assume hypothetically that the president was in his second term and he said to himself, you know, Joe Biden is running for president, Dershowitz said. I really should now be concerned about whether his son is corrupt, because he's not only a candidate ... but he could be the President of the United States, and if he's the president of the United States and he has a corrupt son, the fact that he's announced his candidacy is a very good reason for upping the interest in his son.

It really comes down to terms of service, Toscano said. If any of us, individually, did the stuff that Trump has done, we would also be banned. It's an agreement that we all made when we signed up for the platform. Are those rules overbearing? Do they need to be critiqued and changed in the future? Possibly. That's more of a Section 230 conversation… we need to have a bigger conversation, as a society, about whether that's right that a company that large has this much power over the government.

But this is entirely different from believing that the president of the United States has sold out his country and that the FBI should be investigating — to the extent of even possibly wearing a wire — a White House because their boss was fired.

Mo Elleithee: Yeah, it's interesting. One of the president's rationales for withdrawing from the Iran deal was that by doing so and imposing these crippling economic sanctions on the regime, it would bring the regime to its knees. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. The regime has become more and more emboldened and has done -- has been escalating its rhetoric. Look, my concern here is, and as others have said, is what are the ramifications regionally? This was not our first opportunity to go after this guy. Stan McChrystal, who was no -- you know, who was fired by President Obama, he was no fan of Obama foreign policy.

In response, protesters blockaded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. It's basically where we were when the show started tonight.
Danon: We have the idea of reentering the agreement and then negotiating with the Iranians. This is a mistake. That's not how you handle business. You don't enter the agreement and then negotiate. You do it in advance before you enter the agreement and I hope that will be the approach. And once there will be negotiations then I think we should be discussing a number of issues that are problematic. First is the issue of enriching uranium, which we just got a public announcement by Tehran that they are enriching to a level of 20% and from 20% it's really easy to jump to higher levels that will lead you to a nuclear bomb.
TRUMP: I think you could see the media has got it in for -- to sort of doing the full press to make sure that Biden is the guy, which is great, in a way, because, I mean, I'd sort of like to see Trump go one-on-one with Biden. When I see Joe Biden talking to a group of 20 people with a teleprompter, because they're afraid of what he may say otherwise, that tells me all I need to know. And in a large and stacked Democrat field, I think it's fine. You can probably hide some of that. Get him on the trail for five, six months one- on-one with Donald Trump, it's going to be awesome.

Making the loss harder to digest was the Nets had gotten Durant back after he had sat out Brooklyn's previous three games — a stretch in which they won two of three — due to the league's quarantine policy after being exposed to COVID-19.
Benjamin Hall: Yes. Good evening, Tucker. As you point out, the whole region has been on high alert all day, waiting for some kind of retaliation from Iran. But actually, what we heard reports of in the last couple of hours are possible strikes by the U.S. These are unconfirmed, we've heard conflicting reports. But there are suggestions that two cars were hit just north of Baghdad a few hours ago and that they contained more Iranian-backed Shia militias, including a key finance facilitated close to Qasem Soleimani. But of course, it is Qasem Soleimani that everybody is talking about. The head of the Al Quds Force, some people say the second most powerful man in Iran and the man responsible for so many hundreds of U.S. deaths. He was killed leaving Baghdad Airport early this morning, having flown in from Lebanon. A U.S. Reaper drone was waiting to take him out. And alongside him, the man who was in charge of the storming of the U.S. embassy. Five others also killed there. People are saying now that this strike may really severely strain U.S.-Iraqi relations. And in fact, the Iraqi prime minister spoke out earlier today and didn't mince his words. He said he condemned the targeting killing as a violation of the terms which underpin the U.S. troop presence in this country. And he went on to say that he has submitted a formal request for parliament to convene in order to adopt necessary measures to protect Iraq's dignity and sovereignty.

She compared her plan to the Marshall Plan, or the European Recovery Plan, where the U.S. gave around $15 billion to help Western Europe recover in the aftermath of World War II.

Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.

In the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty interview clip, Bolton made no mention of any illicit quid pro quo, and acknowledged, as Republicans have claimed, that combating corruption in Ukraine was a high priority for the Trump administration.
WALTZ: No, I don't think we are. I think this was a response to stop the series of escalations. The President's made it clear that if they escalate again, our response will be overwhelming.

Abilities such as online check-ins and check-outs, mobile keys and room settings controlled by Internet of Things (IoT) technology will become much more commonplace, added Hollister. Using IoT to control room settings also allows hotels to gather more data on guests, creating a more personalized experience when they next return.

But there's no guarantee that that's going to be the case. And the big risk is that unwittingly, just as Barack Obama thought the Iraq war was a mistake.

What we really want to do is avoid an Iraq-like war with Iran.

I saw [the suspect] try to un-holster [the trooper's] gun, I was like 'oh yeah, we can't have that', knowing the conditions outside we're on the side of the freeway too, I didn't know if his hands were wet or anything, if he gets his gun it could be me and the trooper that are gone... you know,' Williams continued.

Over the years, our current Ambassador to Germany and former Fox News contributor, Richard Grenell, and I became friends. Everyone was very excited when Romney, having won the GOP nomination in 2012, chose Ric to be his national security spokesman for the campaign. As the New York Times put it at the time, Mr. Grenell, a 45-year-old with a sharp wit, had joined the Romney campaign in April with sterling recommendations from Bush-era foreign policy figures, and an impressive résumé. He had served as a United States spokesman at the United Nations under four ambassadors during the Bush administration…

Former federal prosecutor Robert Ray is a new full-fledged member of the team. And he joins me right now on set. Good to see you, Robert. Thanks so much for being here.
The Democrats have quickly shown us that in the next two years they won't be interested in getting a thing done for the country or the people who elected them. They hate President Trump, and they're going to spend their time in office showing us just how much they hate him.

TRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been for embassies. And I think that probably Baghdad already started. They were really amazed that we came in with that kind of a force. We came in with very powerful force and drove them out. You know that ended almost immediately. But Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been for embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too. But it was imminent and then all of a sudden, he was gone.

Trump added: So go home, we love you, you're very special, you've seen what happens, you've seen the way others are treated that are so bad, so evil. I know how you feel.
My biggest bet is that platforms like Facebook and Twitter, maybe even YouTube, they are not built for a world [with] a different Section 230. They're not built for that and I think by the time that they realize that it is a strategic business initiative that they need to take on, it will be too late, Toscano said. There are thousands of people trying to create the next social media [platform] right now… I think what's going to happen is, a new platform will pop up that is built around accountability and proper ways to manage free speech and these platforms that are now in the direction of censorship, because they've set that precedent for themselves, I think they're gonna start to crumble.

And you can defend a lot of people getting killed with a clip that's 10 or more period. So the idea the government is going to tell you that you can't defend with a type of clip or magazine is obscene.

If the Biden's are truly corrupt, it could never be an impeachable offense to investigate corruption or to ask our friends to investigate corruption pursuant to our treaties and so, we will put that evidence on if witnesses are allowed in this trial and we will I think be able to prove dispositively that this President as he has always done was putting the interests of the American people and the American taxpayer first.

It is this battle that will shape the future of the Republican Party over the next four years.

And if history judges the electoral rebellion poorly, people like Cotton and Ben Sasse can say they stood up for the Constitution.

But Mexico and China are also linked to the deaths of Americans. Each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of Americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. So, does that mean we get to bomb Oaxaca? Can we start assassinating generals in the People's Liberation Army? Maybe. Maybe Ben Sasse will call for that, too. He's a former consultant and a very tough character. But before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. Our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the United States richer and more secure. There are an awful lot of bad people in this world. We can't kill them all. It's not our job. Instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of American citizens. Period. That's why we have a government. So, has the killing of Soleimani done that? Maybe. No one in Washington has explained how. Instead, like Ben Sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. He clearly was. So? That's irrelevant. Meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. We're praying they don't, but they could. How do we know that? Because we've seen it before. We fought quite a number of wars around the Middle East in recent decades. We attacked Saddam Hussein twice, as you know. In the end we killed him.

He was making more plans for terror attacks, spreading Iran's malign influence. Why not kill him?
Here's just one of his tweets. Wow, just learned in a failing New York Times that the corrupt leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me for no reason and with no proof after I fired lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze.
ROVE: Well, he may -- he -- maybe he should do it in order to get us out of the boxed canyon, because if he does do it, it will go to court and quickly, I think, the courts will say, you don't have the authority in this instance.
Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., called for a racketeering investigation on Sunday following Amazon, Apple and Google's decisions to suspend the alternative social media platform Parler after Wednesday's U.S. Capitol riot.
Such a sweeping policy would almost certainly be dead on arrival as long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress or the White House. Krugman noted the political realities for the left, arguing that Democrats can't enact such a plan this year but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years.
We know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going
Iran's opaque judiciary and penal system repeatedly tortured Afkari into admitting a killing he did not carry out, according to human rights organizations and Western governments.

What Trump is doing with the help of many members of his party is certainly the most historically significant part of his presidency – more than an impeachment, more than judicial appointments or any piece of policy. It is unprecedented and deals with matters central to the survival of the republic

Twitter's bad news, Trump said. They're all bad news. If you want to go through social media, Big Tech, if you're a Republican or have a big voice, they shadow ban you.
MATT WHITAKER, FORMER ACTING ATTORNEY GENERAL: That's exactly what Mitch McConnell's trying to avoid but as you mentioned, it takes 51 votes to do about anything. We know the outcome of the trial. We just don't know how we're going to get there right now. So as I look at what the Senate is trying to accomplish, it is trying to keep a solid group of Republican senators together that keeps its train on the tracks. If they can't, then we could have Hunter Biden, we could have a whole host of folks be witnesses and that's when, I think the credibility of the Senate is really - could take a serious hit.

GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I agree with you. It lends legitimacy to illegitimate articles of impeachment. The second one is an utter joke. Obstruction of Congress for asserting a legal right to resist a subpoena. If Congress disagreed, their remedy is to go to federal court, it's always been that way. So that one should immediately be dismissed.

You've got to worry about it, right, because if he's the sole guy stopping them, the pressure on him from his friends and former allies is going to be enormous, McIntosh said. So I think a much better stopgap would be to keep the Republican majority in both of these races.

The media really didn't care about the scandal that broke. The L.A. Times and a few others did. And here's what they wrote: The chief of China's military intelligence secretly directed funds from Beijing to help reelect President Clinton in 1996. Former Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung told federal investigators. Chung said he met three times with intelligence officials who ordered $300,000 deposited into the Torrance businessman's bank account to subsidize campaign donations intended for Clinton, according to sources.

Pelosi noted that the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation to fully reopen the government last week, including a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security that provides $1.3 billion for border security with no funding for the wall. Trump, who has repeatedly requested $5.7 billion for the wall, has said he will sign no such bill and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has repeatedly said he will not bring that legislation up for a vote in the upper chamber.

Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post that savaged Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response Wednesday morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see.

Despite the setbacks, there is some reason for optimism among progressive groups. A growing number of Democrats considering a presidential bid have signaled support for the sweeping Green New Deal pushed by Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal lawmakers, underscoring how the 2020 field is being pulled further left by the influential progressive wing.

Some foreign experts say Kim never had any intention of fully relinquishing his nuclear weapons and only attempted to use diplomacy with Trump as a way to weaken the sanctions and buy time to perfect his arsenal.

Finally, cost cannot be ignored. According to the Pentagon, the war in Afghanistan is costing $45 billion per year. A report published last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded that Department of Defense (DoD) Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the Afghan conflict from Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 to FY 2018 would be more than $840 billion. However, one estimate has the war costing more than $1 trillion to date and another estimates total war spending for Afghanistan at roughly $2 trillion when other war-related costs are included.

Even if the whole of Afghanistan doesn't need to be secured, it is still a bridge too far. According to the most recent Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) quarterly report, 11.6 million Afghans live in areas either under the control of, or contested by, insurgents. That would require 232,000 troops, which is more than double the peak U.S. troop deployment in Afghanistan of roughly 100,000 soldiers and some 15 times more than the current force in Afghanistan.

If that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. Its proposals on the economic front include a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.

He argued that Amazon, Apple and Google's suspension of his social media platform is a pretty prime example of antitrust, adding that he believes Big Tech is using the violence at the Capitol as an excuse to squash their first real competitor.
[Ed. note: Antifa most certainly is bad. So is social isolation. So is the decline of the nation's spiritual health. So is the rise of negative partisanship. So is the dearth of local news coverage. There's so much that is bad in American public life these days. But what really saddens me are those who pretend Wednesday's ransacking was inevitable. Aside from excusing the conduct of the vandals and rioters, it suggests somehow that the case for America is hopeless. What a sad betrayal of the sacrifices made to provide the extraordinary opportunities we now enjoy. The doom caucus helped lead us here. It's time to start tuning them out.]
To realize how fumbled the current vaccine rollout is, we can look to back to 1947, when a single case of smallpox in New York City led to a mass vaccination program of 6 million people in less than a month, using glass syringes as opposed to modern techniques.

All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump?

FLEISCHER: It's just such a joke on its face because what they're trying to pretend is as if they're a real court of law and they're not. If the founders wanted to put this in a real court of law for a real trial, they would have done so. Then impeachment would have gone to a jury. It's not, it's going to a political body. It's gone to the House and now it's gone to the Senate. The framers intended it to be political because they want politicians who are accountable to the people to make these final decisions about whether you overthrow the people's determination from an election so stop pretending this is a court of law. If it's a court of law, why are they reading newspaper articles about it? Why are they appearing on TV? Jurors are not supposed to read articles about the cases in which they're hearing. So aren't all those Democrats who read newspaper stories biasing themselves? No, because it's not a real trial and none of us should look at it the way, we do and the Democrats should stop this silly game. No one 's buying it.

There was more cleavage on that stage than the San Andreas fault, Laura. I could not believe some of these outfits.

Bill Clinton. One of the strangest nomination speeches ever… By the end, I half expected him to say, in the spontaneous laid-back style of the whole speech: I've changed my mind. I nominate myself. Or, if you're a constitutional stickler, my wife. It would have made for the greatest call of the roll in 100 years. – Charles Krauthammer (1950-2018) writing in the Washington Post on Sept. 6, 2012.

Johnny Joey Jones: Well, I think it's impossible to separate the emotional appeal of killing someone who deserved to die and the overall strategic kind of cautionary tale of what are we going to do next? You know, I wrote for FoxNews.com today that the tactical decision to send troops into Iraq that I was a part of, the troop surge got the al-Qaida out of Al Anbar, but would we do next? What was the strategic goal after that? Same thing, I was a part of a troop surge in Afghanistan when I lost my legs. We got the Taliban out of the poppy fields, away from the opium trade, but what did we do the next day? And that was the problem, and I think a lot of this is that politicians that hold each other accountable, they throw each other under the bus. So, when we change presidents, sometimes we change policy for that purpose -- so that we can be a contrast, not necessarily more right or more wrong. And so, it's not so much that I take issue or really have an opinion over killing this guy yesterday. It's what are we doing next? What is the strategy, not the tactical, what did in this one operation, but what's the overall point here?

By Dec. 15, about five weeks after the presidential election and roughly five weeks before the presidential inauguration, Vanity Fair published an article by Emily Jane Fox headlined Democrats are Paving the Way to Impeach Donald Trump.

I mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the TSA. I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.

After just three weeks with the Romney campaign, Ric resigned. There has been speculation about what exactly led to his departure. The fact of the matter is he was pushed out after Mr. Romney failed both a character and moral test: to stand up for someone he hired who was being attacked for being gay.

Twenty percent of likely Democratic caucus goers support the Vermont senators, that's according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second place with 17 percent, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is third with 16 percent, and former V.P. Joe Biden has 15 percent. The Iowa caucuses are on February 3rd. Meantime, Texas is cracking down on new refugees. Governor Greg Abbott says his state is already overwhelmed and is now rejecting resettlements. It is the first state in the nation to do so under a Trump administration order granting local governments that authority. Abbott's decision is being denounced by refugee advocates and others. I'm Aishah Hasnie. Now back to The Ingraham Angle.
Donna Edwards: I'm not ready -- I'm like most voters. I'm not ready to do that quite yet. But I do look at the collective energy in the Democratic field. You can see that in the fundraising, where collectively the field still seems to be able to demonstrate that, from small donors across the board, that Democrats do still have the, you know, wind at their sails.

It's sickening to see the United States Supreme Court rubber-stamp Trump's extreme, anti-immigrant, xenophobic agenda, he said.

So, they have a lot at stake in protecting Obama's foreign policy legacy.
I warned at the time that trying clever parliamentary maneuvers would simply fail to satisfy the Republican base. As public policy the $2,000-per-person grant is a bad idea. However, as political policy in the most important runoffs in American history, once President Trump staked out a pro-$2,000 policy the Senate GOP should have voted on it and given Sens. Loeffler and Perdue a chance to prove to economic populists that they were on their side.

Real quick, before we get to technology, Senator, in terms of that resolution, is there any concern that you have got, the senators, basically having allegiance to Joe Biden? He's served 36 years in the Senate. There are some senators who will be -- quote, unquote -- jurors who are running for president. Of course they have a -- they have their motive. And then there are others who perhaps have an allegiance to Joe Biden.

Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.

I want to begin with this monologue on this point, I want to ask everyone a simple question, you playing at home, answer in your mind's eye the question and I really want you to think about it.

And now you have a president who took out a general who had blood on his hands? What do we say to somebody, what do we say to these troops having to go there? What do we say, this was said by my friend Mike Wallace, what do we say to those Gold Star families, what do we say to those who have been maimed, what do we say to those who Soleimani did to our country, and when we had a chance to take him out the president acted in very realist terms, as you said earlier. And we did it with purpose.

BARTIROMO: Do you think you would like to see witnesses? I mean, witnesses can go either way. I know that. But they could also open up this can of worms around Hunter Biden, which seems to have been forgotten at this point.
CARLSON: It is terrifying that someone like that sits on a Federal bench. Roger Stone needs a pardon. And let's get past this. That's my view.
Many will be facing limited travel budgets in 2021, so properties will need to appeal to value travelers who will be in search of low rates but also willing to spend a little bit more if it means an improved quality of stay, safer experience and increased flexibility or benefits.
Kim didn't cite any specific U.S. actions. North Korea has previously called regular U.S. military drills with South Korea, flights by U.S. surveillance aircraft and the American military presence in South Korea as proof of hostility. In particular, the North views the U.S.-South Korean drills as an invasion rehearsal, though the allies have repeatedly denied that.

TRUMP: The President of Ukraine said, I did absolutely nothing wrong. He said, I had no pressure whatsoever. He didn't even know what we were talking about. And we called them before I released the transcript, because it's a terrible thing to have to release a conversation with a leader from another country, it's a terrible thing. I mean what are other countries other than Ukraine, what are they saying. So, anyway, they have no case.

Hostin also seemed to try and trip Dershowitz up, asking him what kind of trial has he seen that doesn't have witnesses or evidence.
Asked whether he intends to follow in Ford's footsteps to the White House, Meijer brushed off the notion, saying it was just one of a couple of hundred domains he registered to own his name.

Statistics provided by the Department of Labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.
The reason that the press is connecting these pardons and commutations, not just the Stone case, but saying that Trump is -- he now says he's the nation's chief law enforcement officer -- is because of The Washington Post story saying that Bill Barr's threatened or at least has told people he might resign as attorney general if the president doesn't stop the tweets.

South Korea's military said it had obtained intelligence showing North Korea staged a military parade at a Pyongyang square on Sunday night. A statement from the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Monday said it was checking whether it was an actual parade or a rehearsal. The parade likely featured new weapons systems in a show of force against the incoming Biden administration, observers said.
The technology has been with us for years. In 1959, the US Navy started using the Phalanx Close-In Weapon System, an autonomous defense device that can spot and attack anti-ship missiles, helicopters and similar threats. In 2014, Russia announced that killer robots would guard five of its ballistic missile installations. That same year, Israel deployed the Harpy, an autonomous weapon that can stay airborne for nine hours to identify and pick off enemy targets from enormous distances. In 2017, China introduced its own Harpy-type weapon.
Here in Nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow Nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where I'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.
On Thursday Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the social network is blocking Trump's Facebook account indefinitely after it was temporarily suspended for policy violations. We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, Zuckerberg wrote, in a Facebook post. Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.
While the Democrats strain to squeeze the last bit of political juice from this shutdown, the president is doing the right thing. He is focused on the security and the sovereignty of the American people and their prosperity. It is a posture that is good policy, but in time it's going to prove to be good politics as well.

In the middle of that, lashing out with political attacks against a TV show. She went after the President by name. What does that say about her?
Kim ordered officials to develop missiles with multiple warheads, underwater-launched nuclear missiles, spy satellites and nuclear-powered submarines. He said North Korea must also advance the precision attack capability on targets in the 15,000 kilometers (9,320 miles)-striking range, an apparent reference to the U.S. mainland, and develop technology to manufacture smaller, lighter nuclear warheads to be mounted on long-range missiles more easily.

On behalf of the people of Kerman province, we will pay a $3 million reward in cash to whoever kills Trump, Hamzeh was quoted as saying.
The move comes after Twitter locked President Trump's account on Wednesday, saying he, too, violated company policies. However, under Trump's account lockdown, he was required to delete the three tweets in violation of policy, which would then trigger a lockout of 12-hours.
Why do some Senate Republicans want to bolster their case? Either they make it or they don't make it.
[Rehnquist] was content to allow the Senate to control its own procedures, said Schaffer. And really, he viewed himself as a guest of the Senate during the impeachment trial.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senate allows the President to basically dictate how the Senate is going to conduct its trial. If the Senate becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the White House, then absolutely the Congress will no longer be an equal branch of government.

In 2012, Mr. Romney's communications strategist was asked how the candidate's message would change now that they were headed into the general election. The answer revealed just how vapid, or dare I say, devoid of character, Romney really was.

IRAN WARNS OF TRUMP OF 'REVENGE', IRAQ ISSUES ARREST WARRANT FOR PRESIDENT IN SOLEIMANI KILLING
Tucker Carlson: I mean, just a macro question to end on. Why is it so hard for our elites to police themselves? If someone is consistently wrong about the big things, why is he still in the same job? If we allowed our heart surgeons to keep working with that kind of track record no one would survive surgeries. So, why do we allow our policymakers to be wrong time and again?
Does any royalty attach itself to their names though? I mean, how big a deal is that? All right. We know your royalty, though, right?
How can middle class people survive, without becoming dependent on government? Ah, that's the point. Government acts exactly like a drug dealer, hooking you on government checks for survival, just like drug dealers addict you to cocaine.
Mike Pompeo: President Trump's decision to remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives. There's no doubt about that. He was actively plotting in the region to take action, a big action as he described it, that would've put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. And last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.
PAUL: -- working for a Ukrainian oligarch, you know? I mean, for goodness sakes, it smells to high heaven. It smells like corruption.
CARLSON: Well, a California City is in uproar tonight over plans to transfer coronavirus patients there. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has the very latest on that story. Hey, Trace.
U.S. authorities also had a helicopter flying over the scene during the incident so presumably the government has video that could show what was happening on both sides.
Mike Pompeo: Chris, the American people should know that President Trump will never shy away from protecting and defending America. It's what we've done over these past weeks and days. It's what we've done over our entire three years with our Middle East strategy. The activity that you're seeing today is fully consistent with that. The American people should know we will continue. The president tweeted it again last night. We will take the actions necessary to keep Americans safe. You know, as for the activity today with respect to Iraq, we've been in their country. We've been supporting Iraqi sovereignty. We've been continuing to take down the terrorist threat against the Iraqi people. The prime minister is the resigned prime minister. He's the acting prime minister. He's under enormous threats from the very Iranian leadership that it is that we are pushing back against. We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign. And we'll continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe.
While almost all the networks and cable news outlets ultimately decided to adhere to long-standing precedent and air the Oval Office address, many of them went out of their way to include live fact-checking of the speech based on their baseless assumption that President Trump would not be truthful.
BUTTIGIEG: Well, I am in a faithful, loving, committed marriage. I'm -- I'm proud of my marriage. And I'm proud of my husband. And I'm not going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh or anybody who supports Donald J. Trump as the moral as well as political leader of the United States.

Democrats accuse the President of acting precipitously though and destabilizing the region, which isn't surprising. If Trump says the sky is up, they're going to say, it's down. But think about this for a moment.
This move by Twitter and Facebook are the biggest blows To his fascism, tweeted John Cusack, who also referenced Facebook, which blocked Trump's account indefinitely as well.
These words echoed Romney's criticism of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign when he repeatedly attacked his character, calling him a fraud, a phony and a con man and vile. Romney also attacked Mr. Trump's foreign policy proposals as dangerous and not smart.

Much of the international community regards the Golan Heights as part of Syria, albeit under Israeli occupation, since the neighboring nation took it during the 1967 Six-Day War.

The observers say North Korea may reach out to South Korea first to promote a mood of reconciliation before pushing for talks with the Biden administration.

Other aid agencies, respectable ones like Doctors Without Borders, or our own C.D.C. banned officials from doing that because it's wasteful.
Later, Dershowitz deployed another hypothetical to argue that Democrats' impeachment was itself, somewhat ironically, a partisan proceeding.

I think your history comment for [Friday] is a bit off or at least does not tell the whole story. The 44 Colt model of 1847 was a collaboration of Sam Walker and Colt in 1846-47. Walker was with the Texas Rangers at the time and wanted a more powerful weapon for the Mexican-American war. The 1000 US military orders were for the State of Texas Military is my understanding. The 44 Walker was the most powerful handgun until the 357 Magnum came along in 1935. They were called 'horse pistols' as they commonly were carried on the pommel of the saddle. These were powerful, accurate repeating weapons. Sam Walker carried two at the time of his death. Military Walkers are stamped with the US and 1847 on the left side of the revolver. Original Walkers are exceptionally expensive. Beat up ones might set you back 40 to 60 thousand dollars while the few really nice ones that are properly authenticated go for nearly a million. I attached a few pictures of me shooting my replica. They are fun guns to shoot and it teaches you a lot about patience as it takes a while to load up the black powder (pyrodex replica in my case) and it is quite powerful. My targets are not the best in the world but certainly show that the revolver could be quite accurate at 25 yards.

Rashida Tlaib is under fire for an alleged anti-Semitic reference on Twitter ... Responding to a post by Vermont Independent Sen.

One U.S. attribute that distinguishes the current Middle East conflict from past ones is the country's energy independence. Last September, U.S. petroleum product exports exceeded imports for the first time in recorded history. The Energy Information Agency expects net exports of total crude oil and petroleum to average 570,000 barrels per day in 2020. Energy independence means that the U.S. has no vital economic interests in the Middle East -- a marked change from past conflicts where the country was dependent on a steady flow of Mideast oil to lubricate the domestic economy. This energy security gives the Trump administration more leeway in its foreign policy approach. We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil, said President Trump in remarks to the nation on Wednesday.

The government was ordered to tell the plaintiffs whether they're on the list, spell out the reasons they are barred from travel, and to give them a chance to challenge the government finding.
Only eight of them are players.
The president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, said Biden spokesman T.J. Ducklo. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now.

CAVUTO: All right, well, they hike, and the strong economy just takes a hike -- that is kind of the message behind the Trump campaign in The Las Vegas Review-Journal, slamming the Democratic rivals over their tax plans, which to a man or woman, mean at least trillions of dollars more in taxes over the next 10 years.

JORDAN: Yes. They were out to get the president. You had on Don Trump Jr. I thought it was a great interview. He said in impeachment started on Election Day. I actually think it started even sooner. I think it started on July 31, 2016, when they opened the Trump-Russia investigation, as I said, went and spied on four American citizens associated with the Trump campaign. And who was heading that investigation? Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, who said in one of those text messages, just went to a Southern Virginia Walmart. I can smell the Trump support. The disdain they have for the president and, just as importantly, the disdain they have for folks like you and me, Maria, who support the president, who voted for the president, that is what is so wrong. And then they get caught with these text messages. And now they're going to sue? This is ridiculous. The American people -- it's great that we -- those text messages were released, because the American can people can see the bias, the animus that these folks, who ran the two biggest investigations probably of our lifetime, the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation, they can see the bias and the animus they had against President Donald Trump.

So say it ain't so, Joe? There's a new report via CNBC that claims several Joe Biden fund-raisers are jumping ship and are now supporting Mike Bloomberg. All this as Biden is hoping to revive the campaign with tonight's debate in Nevada and obviously get things going again in South Carolina.
This is only par for Cruz, whom many Americans first got to know as the architect of the bogus 2013 defund ObamaCare government shutdown. Then he succored Trump's 2016 candidacy when he thought it would benefit him but concluded his doomed run lashed up with John Kasich and Carly Fiorina in a desperate, goofball bid to block Trump. The guy who told delegates in Cleveland that year to vote your conscience may have abrogated his former views, but never his ambition.

The heartbroken family of a 2-year-old boy who died after a visit to the dentist last year is suing the Arizona clinic, claiming that a staff member repeatedly muted the alarm on a heart monitor that he was hooked up to, and that the oxygen tank he was supposed to be receiving supplemental air from was either faulty or empty.
And, of course, he made the terminals that became ubiquitous and made him a guy worth $60 billion-plus.
The Taliban calls U.S involvement in the country – now the longest-running war in U.S history – as an illegitimate occupation by foreign forces.

Tony Badran, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called the attack an important moment in the U.S.'s Iraq policy.
I warned at the time that trying clever parliamentary maneuvers would simply fail to satisfy the Republican base. As public policy the $2,000-per-person grant is a bad idea. However, as political policy in the most important runoffs in American history, once President Trump staked out a pro-$2,000 policy the Senate GOP should have voted on it and given Sens. Loeffler and Perdue a chance to prove to economic populists that they were on their side.

So we're -- we're rolling up our sleeves and going to -- going to get it done.
The move comes after Twitter locked President Trump's account on Wednesday, saying he, too, violated company policies. However, under Trump's account lockdown, he was required to delete the three tweets in violation of policy, which would then trigger a lockout of 12-hours.

So McConnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the American people. Not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. No, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt President Obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the American people. You can bet every penny you have that McConell feels the same way about our incoming president.
AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Aishah Hasnie. Bernie Sanders leading in Iowa with the first nominating contest just weeks away. Twenty percent of likely Democratic caucus goers support the Vermont senators, that's according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second place with 17 percent, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is third with 16 percent, and former V.P. Joe Biden has 15 percent. The Iowa caucuses are on February 3rd. Meantime, Texas is cracking down on new refugees. Governor Greg Abbott says his state is already overwhelmed and is now rejecting resettlements. It is the first state in the nation to do so under a Trump administration order granting local governments that authority. Abbott's decision is being denounced by refugee advocates and others. I'm Aishah Hasnie. Now back to The Ingraham Angle.

Aware of the resistance to killer robots, the US Department of Defense issued Directive 3000.09, which requires that weapons be designed to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force. The word appropriate requires a human operator be in-the-loop (i.e., control the weapon) or on-the-loop (i.e., supervise the weapon) and have the final say in taking human lives. As a result, the Navy currently only uses the X-47B prototype in a semiautonomous mode, always keeping a human operator involved.

Boudin has defended his office's choices, saying that charging McAlister with a new, nonviolent crime would not have necessarily put the serial offender behind bars. He instead blamed law enforcement agencies, saying they could also have acted differently to avoid a terrible and devastating tragedy but vowed to make concrete changes in his office.
But a more honorable approach for the newly elected senator would have been to become a leader in his caucus, to attempt to work with and advise the president by becoming a trusted voice, and to serve the American voter by making this presidency as successful as possible.

JONAH GOLDBERG, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, so that' -- that's part of the irony here, right, is the fight over this is almost purely symbolic now. It is a, if they win, we lose, zero sum understanding that if Trump gets anything he can claim victory for, Democrats will feel like it's a loss, and vice versa.

Meanwhile, among the notable personnel changes announced Monday was the name of Kim Jong Un's influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, missing from a new lineup for the party's powerful Politburo, where she had served as an alternate member since last year.

Some observers earlier predicted she would be promoted to a full member of the bureau. It wasn't immediately clear why the 32-year-old lost her Politburo post. But given her direct lineage to the ruling Kim family, some experts caution against speculating her political clout has diminished.

If they wanted the government reopened the Dems could negotiate with the president and reopen it tomorrow. He's already compromised on the structure of the wall and dropped his asking price. And while the Democrats feign concern over spending a few billion on a border wall - $5.7 billion - the Coastal Wonder Twins of their party, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Bill DeBlasio of New York, have all kinds of money — they'd spend pots of money - for the health care of illegal immigrants. They have no problem finding pots of money to spend on the well-being and health of illegal aliens.

The Writer's Almanac: On this date in 1610, Galileo wrote a letter describing his discovery of three of Jupiter's moons. He discovered them in December, after improving his telescope design. He wasn't sure at first they were moons; he thought they were fixed stars. He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers. Marius's names stuck, and today we know the moons as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

In order to counter Iran, I think the choice is clear. The President should contain Iranian influence in the region. We should avoid a hot war, which we are barreling towards at all costs.
RAY: Well, it's a big deal because, ultimately, in the eyes of history, we are all going to be judged about whether or not we acted in the best interests of the country. I think the president's principal defense -- and you saw it in the answer that was interposed over the weekend -- is very simple. This is an entirely partisan and, therefore, illegitimate effort by House Democrats to remove a president from office. And the remedy for that is the United States Senate, as envisioned by the framers of the Constitution. In order to overturn the will of the electorate in the 2016 election, and particularly given the fact that we are now in the middle of a presidential campaign for 2020, ultimately, that will can only be overturned with a bipartisan effort and overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, with a two-thirds majority, in order to remove a president and overturn the will of that electorate. It's very simple.
And after this airstrike and killing of Soleimani, we've actually forced them together because the people of Iraq may not like the Iranians, but they don't necessarily want their country turned into a battleground between the United States and Iran. So, I hope we'll just leave. That's the key. If we get out, then we're going to have to watch for what the Iranians are likely to do, and we can talk about that if you like.

America's message to the Kremlin should be unequivocal: actions have consequences, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a statement. Administrator Bridenstine's invitation to Dmitry Rogozin, one of the leading architects of the Kremlin's campaign of aggression toward its neighbors, undercuts our message and undermines the United States' core national security objectives.
WALLACE: Up next, House Speaker Pelosi moves to impeach President Trump
Trump was publicly critical of Pence for the first time on Jan. 6, writing on his now-suspended Twitter account that the vice president didn't have the courage to intercede on his behalf during the certification proceedings.

Finally, cost cannot be ignored. According to the Pentagon, the war in Afghanistan is costing $45 billion per year. A report published last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies concluded that Department of Defense (DoD) Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding for the Afghan conflict from Fiscal Year (FY) 2001 to FY 2018 would be more than $840 billion. However, one estimate has the war costing more than $1 trillion to date and another estimates total war spending for Afghanistan at roughly $2 trillion when other war-related costs are included.

So now, after speaking well of President Trump during his Senate campaign, Mitt Romney has turned on him again. One has to wonder that if Romney held such major objections to the president, why did he hide them from the people of Utah before the midterm election? The answer is obvious: revealing his true feelings about Mr. Trump could have cost Romney the election.

A sharp elbowed reference to the thousands of Democratic lawmakers who trotted to Puerto Rico for a retreat, where they hope to strategize ways to help the dead mired U.S. territory and even planned to see a special performance of the hit Broadway show Hamilton.

The Trump administration, through the OMB, withheld a total of about $400 million of security assistance from Ukraine last summer. This came after Trump asked Ukrainian President Voldomyr Zelensky to investigate the family of his 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and while the White House allegedly was withholding an Oval Office visit from Zelensky in exchange for that investigation.

What this does, the only sanctuary it provides is to criminals, he said. It makes those communities less safe, it also makes ICE and law enforcement officials less safe so instead of picking up an individual in a confined jail setting, they have to go into communities to knock on doors and the like.
Trump insists he did nothing wrong and that he never called for any quid pro quo with the investigations. His administration claims that Trump was simply concerned about corruption within the Ukrainian government, asserting that is part of why he delayed the aid. Trump has also hammered the Bidens for alleged impropriety, blasting the former vice president for pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma.
Dozens of inmates convicted of terrorism-related crimes will be released from prison over the next five years, and lawmakers in several states think local law enforcement have the right to know if they're moving into their neighborhood.

According to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.

TRUMP: I think it's incredible. I think it's really hurting them. Look, my numbers are the highest, my poll numbers. You have this guy that goes on television all the time. He gives phony numbers. My poll, as you know, my poll numbers right now today are the highest they've ever been. And, by the way, people love that we took this horrible terrorist. They love it, Soleimani. The love that we took him out. They think it's so fantastic. He should have been taken out over the last 20 years by somebody. He should have been taken out a long time ago. But my numbers are the highest they've ever been, and a lot of it is because of the impeachment hoax. It's a hoax. How would you like to be two, two-and-a-half years, I'm under investigation, federal investigation before I even ran, in my opinion, before I came down the escalator.

Chris Van Hollen: Well, because you have to look at what the consequences are, right? We don't go around killing all the very bad people in the world. We have President Trump embracing Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea who's got a lot of blood on his hands and is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier, an American citizen, and yet he's getting love letters from the president of the United States. So, the question is, do we further our interests by killing Soleimani? And everything we've seen is we've actually increased the risks of war dramatically, we've put Americans at greater threat, and we seem to have accomplished Soleimani and the Iranians' main goal, which is to undermine our influence and support in Iraq. We now have the top Iraqi leadership, the president and the prime minister, condemning the United States' action. We have Parliament meeting to talk about expelling U.S. forces. What was Soleimani's main goal in Iraq? It was to get the Americans out, to undermine our influence. So, we seem to have accomplished what Soleimani was trying to do but couldn't, so in death he's actually accomplished his goal. That is a -- that turns back U.S. interests in the region.
We used drones, ground radars, human intelligence, image intelligence, and other forms of the most advanced special intelligence in the world.

And in a sign of how some of the conservative media have turned on the president, a Wall Street Journal editorial says: The leading culprit here is Mr. Trump, who as always refuses to accept responsibility for defeat. Recall that he also claimed the Iowa caucus result was stolen in 2016 when he lost to Ted Cruz. He's now spinning conspiracy theories and election falsehoods daily on Twitter . He doesn't seem to care what damage he does in promoting the myth of his victory.
There are numerous complaints from non-violent political activists who say they ended up on a no-fly list for something they said. Former Princeton University professor Walter Murphy told The Guardian that in 2007, he was denied a boarding pass in Newark International Airport. He suspects it was because of a high-profile lecture he gave that had been critical of then-President Bush. In 2012, Wade Hicks, the spouse of a Navy lieutenant, claimed he was told he was on a no-fly list. He thinks it was because of comments he made about 9/11.

In other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, Muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 American households. And if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. Since 1978 CEO salaries in America's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. Meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. In 1965, CEOs in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. As recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. Today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. No wonder people are sending money to Bernie Sanders. That's what happens when you abuse the system. You discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. Now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. In Europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. Airbus CEO Tom Enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. That's a lot, but it was half as much as Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg made, and Airbus planes didn't even crash. This is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. It's dangerous for our country. Why? Well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like Dennis Muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. Attitudes are changing fast.

All viruses evolve, and very rarely a virus will change in a way that requires us to re-evaluate public health policy, added Dr. Erik Volz, a scientist at Imperial College London and one of the study authors, in a statement.

If rural, more conservative areas see a large surge in turnout on Election Day, then that will be a key for Loeffler and Perdue to win.

Trump, who publicly said for the first time on Sunday that he will deliver a State of the Union address on Jan. 29, also insisted he can relate to the hundreds of thousands of workers who have been furloughed amid the ongoing partial federal government shudown -- and he made clear he thinks he has their support.

TRUMP'S 'ABSOLUTE RIGHT' AS PRESIDENT: In an exclusive interview with FOX News' Sean Hannity, President Trump said he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency if he can't reach an agreement with congressional Democrats to provide funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border ... The law is very clear. I mean, we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, Trump said. This is a national emergency, if you look what's happening.
But there is bad news: The driving death rate increased in Colorado and Washington after legalization. But the data isn't clear -- driving deaths are up even more in some neighboring states like Idaho, where weed is still banned.
Pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us. The real threat is Iran. Well, they're liars. And they don't care about you. They don't care about your kids. They are reckless and incompetent. And you should keep all of that in mind, as war with Iran looms closer tonight.
The theme of party disunity, amplified by the leak of the Raffensperger call, echoes across the media landscape:

Sen. Dayna Polehanki pushed an effort to ban all firearms from the Capitol by introducing legislation last year that died in session.

The fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge, said Pelosi, adding that President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.
MNUCHIN: Maria, let me just start by first expressing our condolences to
INGRAHAM: Today, Mike Pompeo gave a very forceful press conference on the fallout from the Iranian jetliner going down. His concern is that people aren't understanding the imminent nature of the threat of Soleimani, and he was pressed on that today. He said, there were large scale attacks planned on U.S. facilities, but he didn't go more specific. Don't the American people have a right to know what specifically was targeted without revealing methods and sources?
We need to act on climate change and a Green New Deal, which is broadly defined as combining policies that reduce emissions and help people economically, is a smart approach. I am less interested in slogans and branding than I am in real policies, which is what I'm running on. The details really matter., Delaney said in a statement to Fox News. The best start is the bipartisan one I introduced in Congress with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICD) - a carbon tax with revenues going back to the American people through a dividend. This plan can result in a 90% reduction in GHG by 2050 by changing behavior, encouraging innovation in new technologies and using market forces to reduce emissions.
It would do a lot to restore public trust in the news industry that all administrations deserve media scrutiny, not just favored ones.

Johnny Joey Jones: Well, I think it's impossible to separate the emotional appeal of killing someone who deserved to die and the overall strategic kind of cautionary tale of what are we going to do next? You know, I wrote for FoxNews.com today that the tactical decision to send troops into Iraq that I was a part of, the troop surge got the al-Qaida out of Al Anbar, but would we do next? What was the strategic goal after that? Same thing, I was a part of a troop surge in Afghanistan when I lost my legs. We got the Taliban out of the poppy fields, away from the opium trade, but what did we do the next day? And that was the problem, and I think a lot of this is that politicians that hold each other accountable, they throw each other under the bus. So, when we change presidents, sometimes we change policy for that purpose -- so that we can be a contrast, not necessarily more right or more wrong. And so, it's not so much that I take issue or really have an opinion over killing this guy yesterday. It's what are we doing next? What is the strategy, not the tactical, what did in this one operation, but what's the overall point here?
The incoming administration of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris needs a Senate willing to work with them to fully and effectively respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, systemic racism in our nation's law enforcement, the existential threat of climate change, and other important challenges our nation faces.

But Xi and his followers have watched their diplomatic, economic and military initiatives come up short, engendering increased resistance from other Indo-Pacific nations rather than the realignment China had expected. Now the Trump administration's trade tariffs threaten to destabilize the Chinese economy, resulting in a cascade failure of Xi Jinping's broader strategy and threatening to undermine the legitimacy of the Communist Party, hence the stronger and more strident attacks.

And yet, voters increasingly believe they are rigged. That inverse correlation is the work of Trump, yes, but also of a coterie of folks across the political spectrum willing to exploit ignorance and fear for the sake of immediate gains – to survive a primary, to get clicks, to gain an advantage on rivals.

New York's coronavirus death toll in nursing homes, already among the highest in the nation, could actually be a significant undercount. But so far the administration of Democratic Gov.

Danon: So I hope and I believe that will not happen. I also, when you follow the messages coming from the language of the president-elect, the language is a little bit different than it was from then.

First of all, two independent polls that I trust and most people trust, Rasmussen and Emerson show that 34 percent of black people support President Trump. Secondly, I travel all the time and I have people whispered in my ear, I love the Trump results. I love the Trump results. I go to a very large black church. Thirdly, look at what this President and his administration have done to directly impact black people. Criminal justice reform. Opportunity zones which impact more directly black communities and this is the only President including the last administration to basically authorize $400 million for historically black colleges and universities because they are struggling. Those are the absolute facts.

Sen. Cornyn: Well, I I I wonder whether Senator Schumer thinks that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden I guess he is no longer in the Senate. Amy Klobuchar and other senators running for president are, strictly speaking, impartial writers. It's not a good it's not a good analogy. I know all of us, including myself, have used that as an analogy, but it's not the same thing as an impartial jury in a criminal or civil case that would be tried in a court of law. We know that the that this is primarily a political matter and one where the people who cast their vote, either in the House from the Senate will be held accountable by the people they represent. That's what this is. So I think it's it's hypocritical, particularly if looking back on the way that Senator Schumer and others conducted themselves in the Clinton impeachment, he actually ran for the Senate against Senator Al D'Amato, saying if elected, he would vote to acquit President Clinton. That's not exactly impartial.

The answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. And yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.

The junior senator from Oklahoma is up for re-election next year in a state Trump just carried by 33 points. But on Nov. 11, Republican Lankford did something the president very much did not like.
As is so often the case, Trump forces Democrats to reveal themselves and the media. They're so caught up with resisting and hating Trump for everything he does and breeze that over the weekend, they literally sounded more empathetic to the mourners of an Iranian mass murderer than to the families of the soldiers he killed and maimed with attacks carried out inside Iraq.
Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who recently endorsed Biden for president, also claimed following a Biden campaign event Sunday that he had no knowledge of Hunter's involvement with Burisma while he was secretary.
Judge Haywood Gilliam granted a request for a preliminary injunction by California, 12 other states and Washington, D.C. The plaintiffs sought to prevent the rules from taking effect as scheduled on Monday while a lawsuit against them moved forward.
Parents, teachers, government, health officials and industry must all work together to help our nation's children grow up healthier, said Tracey Halliday, a spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association, which represents the nation's non-alcoholic refreshment beverage industry.
Cameron Khansarinia, the policy director for the National Union for Democracy in Iran (NUFDI), a nonpartisan organization of Iranian-Americans, told Fox News: While most athletes fear the further cancellation of sporting events due to the COVID-19 pandemic, athletes in Iran fear being murdered by the Islamic Republic. After murdering champion wrestler Navid Afkari, the criminal regime occupying Iran intends to put fellow wrestler Mehdi Ali Hosseini to death.
So, what you're going to have is Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer's desire to stack the court on their Democratic watch has come back to haunt them.
In the president's video, addressing supporters, he said: I know your pain, I know your hurt.
Lies and fraud are at the center of this murder of the middle class. President Obama and various big government politicians need to distract the middle class from their real agenda. Lies are their WMD- weapon of mass distraction.
RAO: So excited to be with you guys today.
The letter is the latest blow to May's push to get her agreement through Parliament ahead of Britain's scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March. She has faced pressure from the pro-Brexit wing of her party to step down, but survived a vote of confidence from her own party last month.
It was also my unwavering commitment to the teachings of Scripture that compelled me to condemn the violence and riots that broke out during Black Lives Matter protests last summer.
All they know is hatred, rage, all things anti-Trump. It is so intense that they've lost all touch with basic reason, common sense, intellectual honesty, equal justice and application of our laws.
The American people deserved to hear this riveting testimony, as well as the words of those who followed. But millions of viewers were robbed of this opportunity when one of the networks, MSNBC, cut away from the press briefing right after President Trump's remarks.
in the face of all of this.
In fact, rules like the safe harbor provision that helped conscientious lawmakers, officials and judges get to this point despite unprecedented efforts to subvert the results are the product of a law passed in the wake of the 1876 nightmare to prevent a repeat.
CARLSON: So what's your plan for the Bernie ascendancy? Are you going to stay in the country?
They have been looking at properties there to buy, because they're currently renting. But they have also been looking at properties in Malibu and New York, our sources tell us.
He is also using his success story to wage war on junk food in public schools in hopes of targeting childhood obesity rates. Other states, under pressure to encourage healthier eating habits for children, are developing similar school programs.
Chris Wallace: We should point out that while they were raising that amount of money, Donald Trump in the fourth quarter raised $46 million, far more than any of the others. He's built up a huge campaign war chest, has more than $100 million cash on hand, which raises the question, Michael, how big an advantage for the president, how big a disadvantage for the Democrats, that he's building up this war chest, just sitting there, basically? He's got a couple of people running against him, but nobody serious, while the Democrats, with the money they've raised, which is impressive, are going to spend all of it going after each other.

For more than a century, the House rules have provided the minority with one last chance to make their voices heard before a bill is passed by introducing amendments to the final text and guaranteeing a vote on those amendments. Under this rules package, this safeguard—called the Motion To Recommit—has been eliminated.

As a result, I believe all members of Congress should be required to obtain a security clearance that can be taken away if they violate the public trust.
The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, DNC Chair Tom Perez, slammed the ruling.
LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is The Ingraham Angle from a busy Washington tonight. Well, the news we made with the President on Friday night drove the news cycle all weekend and it didn't even stop today. Nancy Pelosi responded to President Trump. We're going to show you what she said before Congressman Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz are here to react.
A country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up in no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.
LEE SMITH, AUTHOR, PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT: Qassem Soleimani was in many ways the cornerstone of the nuclear agreement that they made in July 2015. The Obama administration made that deal not with the imaginary moderates, but with the hardliners and no one was a harder man in that regime than Qassem Soleimani. He really was the cornerstone of the deal in many ways.
During congress meetings last week, Kim labeled the U.S. as our foremost principal enemy and disclosed a list of high-tech nuclear weapons systems under development to cope with what he called intensifying American hostility. He said the fate of relations between Pyongyang and Washington depend on whether the U.S. abandons its hostile policy.
In the end, Qatar did not have to accede to any of the demands. It also appears that the coming Biden administration taking the reins of U.S. foreign policy could have also have played a part in accelerating a resolution. Stemming the Iran nuclear program, which appears to be advancing, with Tehran's announcement that it is increasing its enrichment of uranium to 20%, is a worrying development both in Washington and in the region. Some say a united Gulf front has now handed a new a strategic defeat to the troubled Iranian regime.

PELOSI, SCHUMER MOCKED ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH 'ANGRY PARENTS' MEMES AFTER THEIR PRIME TIME TRUMP REBUTTAL
Meanwhile, Democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the White House and across the country on Thursday, just one day before the partial shutdown over border wall funding threatens to deny all of them their first full paycheck.
WALLACE: Coming up, the shutdown over the border wall tests the new divide in Washington.

Cotton condemns tactics used by Cruz, Hawley - The Hill
Speaking to reporters after the brief session, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the president just got up and walked out.
As Trump faces impeachment and a reelection bid in 2020, the impact of his judicial selections will be felt long after his presidency ends, regardless of whether he serves one term or two.
Even so, there will be at least four serious contenders in the Senate that will make life much harder for Sen. Chuck Schumer as he tries to overcome his members' personal ambition for the good of the party overall.
TRUMP: So, when I came in as you know NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. If you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a rollercoaster down. Now, and Secretary Stoltenberg, I think he's terrific. In my first year, I raised $130 billion from them, not from us. And now he just announced $530 billion, all because of me. He's my biggest salesman. My greatest salesman Secretary Stoltenberg. But I said to him, look, you're there for Russia and Europe. OK. By the way, NATO is much more for Europe than it is for us and yet we--
Following Trump's brief suspension after the violence that took place on Capitol Hill Wednesday, Twitter announced on Friday evening that the president will no longer be able to tweet.

The names you see listed below are grouped here by their offices or careers. This is only useful here in the very early going when we are still five months away from the first debate. As we progress, new lanes and groupings will emerge based on the ideologies, personal traits, electoral strategy and attitudes of the candidates. But for now, job description will be enough.
How will Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi handle their unusual, nationally televised tandem response to Trump's remarks?
MEGHAN MCCAIN AND 'VIEW' CO-HOSTS GET HEATED OVER OCASIO-CORTEZ AND ICE
You go back to FDR's use of radio, John F. Kennedy's mastery of television, Ronald Reagan's theatrical skills, Obama's hope and change, and no president more than Donald Trump has been able to dominate media coverage, social media and the culture itself through the force of his personality, changing the Republican Party much more than on any particular issues that he is putting at the top of his agenda, Kurtz said.
WALLACE: -- on Bill Barr as the next attorney general. What does he need to say to persuade you, to assure you that he is going to let the Mueller investigation go to its conclusion and be reported to Congress? And is there anyway that that you can vote to confirm Bill Barr?
WALLACE: President Trump responding to a brand-new Senator Mitt Romney, who wrote a controversial article this week saying the president has not risen to the mantle of the office, which understandably got a lot of attention.
CRUZ: We're going to be fair, and we're going to give the president a full opportunity to defend himself.
CIS research director Steven Camarota says even though experts may disagree over his numbers, one thing is clear - a border wall with Mexico will eventually pay for itself by reducing taxpayer burdens.
The Church is described by the Associated Press as a satirical pseudo-deity which originated in the U.S. in 2005 as a protest against religion encroaching into public schools.
Guy Benson: Would you vote in favor of hearing from John Bolton if there was a vote on that subpoena, whether it's, let's say, in your one of your committees, the Judiciary Committee of Chairman Graham decided, OK, let's do it under our auspices or whether it was the full Senate. Do you personally support hearing from John Bolton in this process?
The Supreme Court will allow the Trump administration to enforce, for now, its public charge immigration restriction, lifting a pair of preliminary injunctions issued by federal judges.
GRAHAM: Well, number one, I wish her well and hope she recovers and continues to serve for many years. But here's what will happen if there's a vacancy, no matter from the liberal wing of the court, there'd be a lot of pushback from the left.
When the nursing home mandate was first issued, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, known as AMDA, had sent out a warning email stating that Cuomo's order admitting infected patients posed a clear and present danger to nursing home residents. Jeffrey N. Nichols, who serves on the executive committee of the group, said, the effect of that order was to contribute to the thousands of deaths.
In Charlotte, North Carolina, 57 homicides recorded last year -- 57. This year, Charlotte reached that number before the end of June and then just kept going. The city finished with 108 murders on the year. That's the most since the early 1990s.

Meanwhile, among the notable personnel changes announced Monday was the name of Kim Jong Un's influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, missing from a new lineup for the party's powerful Politburo, where she had served as an alternate member since last year.

Despite the setbacks, there is some reason for optimism among progressive groups.

Moreover, oil is the not the Achilles heel of the regime. Maduro and his gang profit mostly off of their criminal enterprises, not state revenues.
Chris Van Hollen: When she feels it's appropriate, and I think that, you know, that will happen. But the issue, Chris, is that we have a constitutional duty in the Senate to have a trial, and it needs to be a fair trial, and every American recognizes that a fair trial means you get to call witnesses, you get to have relevant documents. We've seen in the last two weeks more emails that have surfaced that show this Trump administration trying to cover up key emails showing that the president of the United States -- confirming again, he ordered the hold on vital U.S. Ukrainian military assistance. And so, why not get those documents? President Trump himself said that he wants Mulvaney to testify. He said that months ago. Why shouldn't we have witnesses? That is the question.

And if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why? Because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. His foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. The gentleman heading the ISIS effort resigned.

It's crazy to think that 11 sitting senators will all compete for the Democratic nomination, and that's because it's not going to happen.

Guy Benson: Senator, I have to say, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, is frequently touted as a master tactician. I think sometimes that reputation has been earned. But I am still flabbergasted that they passed these articles of impeachment, rushed to do it before Christmas, and time was of the essence. It was very urgent for the well-being of our very republic that they do it as soon as possible, which is why they raced through everything and then shoved it in a drawer. Both articles in a drawer and it's been sitting there collecting dust now for weeks. It is 2020. Are you surprised that this continues to be the status quo? What exactly are they doing?
WALLACE: With Nancy Pelosi back as speaker, we'll discuss the new challenges facing the president in this era of divided government with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

President Trump's lawyers could make a motion to dismiss or one of the senators could make a motion to dismiss and take a vote right away. Whether they decide to do that or not will be up obviously to the members of the Senate, maybe to the Chief Justice initially. But I have absolutely no doubt that the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power which every president since Adams has been accused of, by their political opponents and obstruction of Congress, which is another way of saying, the President exercised separation of powers and checks and balances in an entirely proper way should never come to actual trial.

I usually strongly disagree with Never-Trump leader Bill Kristol's constant criticism of President Trump. Kristol refuses to recognize the president's major accomplishments in improving the U.S. economy and making our country safer. He can't bring himself to admit that whatever flaws he thinks Mr. Trump may have, our country dodged a bullet with Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton since a Clinton presidency would have continued the disastrous domestic and foreign policies of President Obama. A President Hillary Clinton also would have undermined our freedom by naming at least two far-left Supreme Court justices.

On Dec. 20, Chinese Rear Adm. Lou Yuan, while speaking at a military trade conference, announced that what the United States feared most was casualties and that the easiest way to defeat China's main rival was to sink two American supercarriers, killing over 10,000 sailors in the process. When that has happened, Admiral Lou announced, then we'll see how frightened America is.
On Sunday, the Washington Post released audio of a call that took place Saturday between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The president refused to acknowledge his loss to Biden and asked the top Georgia election official over the phone to find 11,780 votes.
Mike Pompeo: President Trump's decision to remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives. There's no doubt about that. He was actively plotting in the region to take action, a big action as he described it, that would've put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. And last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.

There are believed to be roughly 350,000 Christians in Iran, a number that is rising as more Muslims convert to Christianity.
Biden has said that he would like to form a new agreement with Iran to deal with their nuclear aspirations. A previous agreement was reached in 2015 when Biden was vice president under President Barack Obama. President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the multi-nation agreement, which Israel opposed before the U.S. ever joined it.
COONS: I don't expect the president to capitulate. I do expect them to compromise.
So, I take Bill Barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.
In contrast, Pompeo said that the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region…. Under new leadership, America has confronted the ugly reality of radical Islamism. On President Trump's very first trip abroad to this region, he called on Muslim-majority nations to … 'meet history's great test – to conquer extremism and vanquish the forces of terrorism.'

Authoritarian regimes have used walls to keep their populations in. During the Cold War, the communist German Democratic Republic constructed the Berlin Wall to separate East Berlin from West Berlin at least as much to keep their own residents in as their Western foes out. The same may be true of the barriers along the Demilitarized Zone on the Korean Peninsula, which, in addition to its military function, serves to keep North Koreans from defecting.
Anti-Trump Protests Break At The University Of Michigan - NBC 6
In his op-ed in The Washington Post, Romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of Trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align U.S. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on China's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.
The president went on to say that it is a very tough period of time — there has never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us — from me, from you, from our country.
While the barriers to testing are nothing like they were in the early days of the pandemic, there are still more challenges than necessary. We must make widescale, rapid testing available.
It's the federal no-fly list, a collection of names of people who are not allowed to board commercial flights into or out of the United States. According to leaked documents obtained by The Intercept, more than 47,000 people were on America's no-fly list as of August 2013. That number reportedly includes 800 Americans, many of whom don't even know they're on it. The government sends no official notification to those on the list; many times, people don't find out until they're denied boarding at the airport.

Great one, I know you've got a lot to say tonight. I won't even throw a question at you.
But, yes, overall, I think the economy has the wind at its back. And I think one reason we're seeing these record highs day after day, and we're going to see him probably tomorrow, too, after tonight's debate, you're going to see the Democrats continue to fray, and that's why the markets like it, because it gives Trump a better chance in November to pull this out.
Trump responded to the Post op-ed during an earlier cabinet meeting: I wish Mitt could be more of a team player. I am surprised he did it this quickly. If he fought really hard against President Obama like he does against me, he would've won the election.

CARLSON: Well, I think he may be close to one of my producers.
ROVE: Yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of Comey. This was leaked to The New York Times, which says something about the culture inside the FBI. The only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since Comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, Mueller is appointed. This was probably immediately subsumed by Mueller -- the Mueller investigation and has been, I suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.

That's right. Dumb is apparently believing you can heap scorn on the intelligence community that brought you the Iraq war and backed the idea that ISIS was not an existential threat.
TRUMP: Dealing with these people is ridiculous. I don't know if they know how to make a deal.
Roberts has voted with his more liberal colleagues to put some of the president's policies on hold. And just weeks after any Senate trial, he would preside over oral arguments concerning Trump's refusal to turn over his banking and financial records, in the face of subpoenas from House committees and a state grand jury.
In a video released by former lawmaker Lam Cheuk-ting on his Facebook page, police turned up at his house and told him he was suspected of violating the national security law, subverting state power. Police told those recording the video to stop or risk arrest.

I don't want to speak for the president. I don't want to lock him in, but I'm confident what I just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the White House. And a lot of Democrats -- and I'm just so frustrated -- we can't get in a room and hammer it out.
INGRAHAM: Yes, you can't even -- there's no words to describe a reaction like that.
Last week, New York resident Tiffany Harris allegedly assaulted three Orthodox Jewish women in Brooklyn. Harris was arrested, charged and released. On Sunday she was arrested and charged with another assault and she was released again.
The embargo long has been described as symbolic by both its supporters and critics, who view it as a solitary move in a world that keeps diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba.
This is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump's video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence, Facebook Vice President Guy Rosen wrote on Twitter.

Yes, these are private companies, so there's no First Amendment issue, but social media platforms have become the new public square. They benefit from federal regulation.

Prior to this role, Jones served as the Chief Operating Officer for the national nonprofit Boot Campaign. In this capacity, he focused on educating the public on the issues pressing veterans and their families. Boot Campaign now serves the health and wellness of the veteran community through a pipeline of treatment resources. While recovering, Jones instituted a peer visit program at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, D.C following his injuries. Notably, Jones went on to create a fellowship on Capitol Hill with the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, where his contributions resulted in direct policy changes within the Veterans Administration and Department of Defense.
The legal saga began last week. D&A asserted in a Dec. 23 Notice of Fraud and Counterfeiting and Production of Evidence filed with the Arkansas court that the 49-year-old Biden was the subject of multiple criminal probes and established bank and financial accounts with Morgan Stanley et al for Burisma for a money laundering scheme.

Monday's announcement is a reversal of a traditional policy whereby Americans are allowed to pay taxes during a shutdown, but refunds are not issued. Trump said over the weekend that the shutdown standoff could last a really long time.

GRAHAM: Let's start with the president. I ask him, Mr. President if you want to go down the emergency path, I stand with you. He said just 30 minutes ago, that's my last option. I think the legislative route is the best way to go, let's make a deal, but I will do it if I have to.
INGRAHAM: Back to the point I was making earlier about the time I was there in 2006 and what I was hearing. And General Qasem Soleimani, he wasn't some bit player in all of this.He was the orchestrator of these terrorist assaults. The attack on the U.S.
Lawmakers in Louisiana and Missouri also will be proposing bills in the 2019 legislative session to establish terrorist registries modeled after the sex-offender lists, said Christopher Holton, vice president for outreach at the Center for Security Policy, a national-security think tank.
The conspiracy theory emerged on a 4chan message board in late 2017 but has crept into mainstream politics. QAnon followers have appeared at Trump's rallies wearing clothes and hats with QAnon symbols and slogans.
In November, President Trump got a higher percentage of minority votes than any Republican in 60 years. The Georgia GOP should have spent far more resources on the Latino and Asian American votes. This opportunity would have included highlighting the election of the largest number of Republican women and minority House members in history.
Will that happen? Well, obviously we're praying that it doesn't. But we know one thing. Right now, as of tonight, America is not ready for this or for any major epidemic. Thanks to the C.D.C.'s flood rollout of coronavirus testing, few locations in this country are even prepared to monitor coronavirus and the economy of course isn't prepared either.
The proposal already has garnered support from dozens of House Democrats, though it's unclear how far Democratic leadership in the chamber is willing to take the idea.

Biden opposes any unilateral steps by either side that undermine a two-state solution, the website said. He opposes annexation and settlement expansion and will continue to oppose both as President.
CRUZ: Well, starting with the second part first, I do think what we have seen coming out of the House is an abuse of the Constitution. And the reason is that they're using this for political purposes. This is the first time in history any president is alleged -- has been impeached without the articles alleging any criminal conduct at all, without alleging any federal crime was violated. They don't allege any federal law was violated. They don't even allege as much as that the president has a speeding ticket, and that has never happened in our country's history. And to use impeachment, like the House Democrats are doing, to express their political disagreement with the president, to try to overturn an election they're unhappy with, that is an abuse of the Constitution. Now, the first question you asked about process and witnesses, let me tell you what we can -- what we can expect to see in the next week or two going forward. On Tuesday, when we come back, the Senate will convene at 1:00 p.m. And we will start with pretrial motions. We will start with probably battling motions. What I expect the Senate to do is adopt a scheduling order laying out the next couple of weeks. That scheduling order is modeled after the scheduling order for the Bill Clinton impeachment. It's very, very similar. So it provides that we start with the House managers getting 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. They can argue evidence.

We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results, the IDP said in a statement at 11:30 p.m. EST. In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report. This is simply a reporting issue. The app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.

Somehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp – like an aide's classified mail on the laptop of a sex offender or huge payments and contributions from Russian-connected sources – was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.

If we have to repeat this misery in 2024, can we count on so many lawmakers, officials and judges to stand up to the threats of a sore loser of their own party?

While almost all the networks and cable news outlets ultimately decided to adhere to long-standing precedent and air the Oval Office address, many of them went out of their way to include live fact-checking of the speech based on their baseless assumption that President Trump would not be truthful.
Besides liking a fighter, the American people want fairness. And the mainstream media have overplayed their hand in false reporting. Anyone who disagrees with their imposed consensus is called a Nazi, a racist, a person of low intelligence or insane.
The fact is, higher fines are going to do nothing, added Rep. David Obey (search), D-Wis., saying more local ownership of television stations is what's most needed.
That being said, any of the governors on this list would have to win as dark horse candidates. Hickenlooper, a moderate and successful businessman, has been nosing around a run longer than the rest, but is still a relative unknown inside his party.

How do you negotiate with the speaker of the House when she tells you even if you open up the government are not going to give you but $1 for the wall? So, until that changes, there's not much left except the national emergency approach.
The president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.
This is someone who's likely to exaggerate the dangerous impulses of the president toward belligerence, his proclivity to act without thinking, and his love of conspiracy theories, Schiff told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on March 22, 2018, when Trump named Bolton national security adviser.
A hundred years from now, if a president doesn't have the House in the same party, that president is going to be impeached. So, it's time to play hardball.
How can you interfere in an organization you oversee? It's rhetorical. You can't.
The contentious debate over immigration policy was thrust back into the spotlight last year as massive migrant caravans tried to make their way through Central America in a bid to enter the U.S. Meanwhile, a zero-tolerance policy instituted by the Trump administration's Justice Department, which led to nearly 2,000 children being temporarily separated from their families after being caught trying to cross the U.S. border, also sparked a national outcry.
In fact, tonight's debate will be interesting, because this is a liability for him. This is an opportunity for him to actually have to answer questions, instead of controlling the airtime that he has by way of the many ads that he's purchased literally everywhere.

The case has again highlighted the dangers of sanctuary city policies in which local jurisdictions refuse to comply with detainers issued by federal immigration authorities. Those detainers are requests that ICE be alerted when an illegal immigrant is about to be released from custody so that they can be transferred to ICE custody and go through deportation proceedings.
TRUMP: If you look at the Middle East right now, it's much tamer than it was when I got in. When I got in, it was just all over the place. Number one, we got rid of the caliphate, the ISIS caliphate. We have tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners. We've killed most of their fighters. We've gotten rid of ISIS. Now they come back and we take care of it. Other people should take care of it. Other countries should take care of it. Europe should take them back.

In the days since the riot, House Democrats have publicly called on Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment in order to remove Trump from office before Biden's inauguration, but Pence has shown no inclination to do so. Lawmakers introduced an impeachment resolution against Trump on Monday.
Iran's decision comes after its parliament passed a bill, later approved by a constitutional watchdog, aimed at hiking enrichment to pressure Europe into providing sanctions relief. It also serves as pressure ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Biden, who has said he is willing to re-enter the nuclear deal.
The New York Times reported that that adviser said that ISIS must be completely defeated and Turkey must promise that it would not target Kurdish troops in the country.

Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other.
No agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away, the statement said.
The Taliban realizes this is in their best interest to talk. But talks with an adversary like this are a process, not an event.

INGRAHAM: The most important thing about this, and we are going to get to Mark in a second, the most important thing people have to understand, an assault style weapon -- people hear that and they think, oh, my God, a machine gun. No. What is an assault-style weapon under the statute? As I'm reading the statute, it's any semiautomatic weapon that holds 10, correct, 10 in the clip, 10 or more in the clip? Most Sig Sauer, we have pictures of them, Sig Sauer 9-millimeter, Glock 9 millimeter, ARs, AK style weapon, the most popular hunting rifle in the United States is the AR-15, correct, depending on the size of the clip would be banned, those style guns?

Separately, Shanahan's spokesman, Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, said that as part of Shanahan's ethics agreement he had stepped aside himself for the duration of his service at the Pentagon from matters in which the Boeing Company is a party.

It's unclear whether Trump will nominate Shanahan for Senate confirmation as defense secretary or turn to another candidate.

Fox News: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for President Trump's immediate removal from office by way of the 25th Amendment for inciting a violent riot at the Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to stop the counting of President-elect Joe Biden's win. She joins with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in urging Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to remove Trump from office immediately, calling him 'a very dangerous person' who committed an 'act of sedition.' Pelosi said if Pence won't act, the House is prepared to impeach Trump again. 'The president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' Pelosi said Thursday, a day after a pro-Trump supporters took over the U.S. Capitol. 'I joined the Senate Democratic Leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment.

Chris Wallace: As soon as the drone strike took out Soleimani, you and other Democrats started criticizing the action.

Don't you believe them?
Yesterday's events were an unprecedented attack on the very core of our democracy – incited by a sitting President, he said in the post.

Rainey told the AP that she led 100 members of Moore County Citizens for Freedom, which describes itself online as a nonpartisan network promoting conservative values, to Washington to stand against election fraud and support President Trump. She said the group attended the Save America Rally near the Ellipse by the White House, but she wasn't aware that anyone in her group had entered the Capitol. She said they were headed back to their buses hours before an emergency curfew took effect.

INGRAHAM: All right, gentlemen, thanks so much. Great to see you both tonight. So what's next? What's going to happen next week? Well, first, senators are going to vote on Tuesday on the resolution we've been discussing this week, almost every night and that resolution will govern the rules of the Senate trial. So set out length of questioning, rebuttal and so forth and now at that point, senators will be able to vote on whether individual witnesses will be called. There'll be a debate that happens and that's when things get very dicey. So if Democrats get their way, they'll do everything in their power to exploit these witness votes.

The drawback to formal American recognition of Israeli sovereignty on the Golan, however, is that it is an issue that has been entirely non-controversial, unlike Israel's presence in the West Bank. Israel can easily maintain the status quo on the Golan without any U.S. recognition whatsoever, but American recognition runs the risk of turning what has been a quiet issue into one that all of a sudden becomes controversial once the spotlight is shone on it, he added. It may end up swapping a security win for a public relations win, which is particularly dangerous now given the heightened importance of keeping the Golan quiet as the Syrian endgame includes a permanent Iranian presence across the Israeli border.

SPALDING: I actually think the Iranian leadership is going to have to take a reassessment based on the strike. So, whatever language the President uses, it kind of reinforces this sense of unpredictability on - so they don't know where the line is. And if they don't know where the line is, they have to reassess. And I think you're going to see a level of stability as a result, not just in Iran. I think it sends a message to Beijing, to Moscow and Pyongyang that they need to pay attention to what the President is saying.

A source confirmed to Fox News a report that Kosovo President Hashim Thaci recently traveled to Germany and met with U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell to discuss a deal that would lower tariffs on Serb goods, and in general lead to a lessening of tensions.

Donald Trump, and his entire family, left comfortable lives, where their days were not filled with death threats, invective, lies, anthrax hoax letters, harassment on airplanes, in restaurants, mocking by the liberal media, accusations of being traitors, Nazis, and targeted by a weaponized federal government with the intention of nullifying his electoral success.
In his tweet, Trump linked to an interview of Bolton in August 2019 where he discusses Ukraine policy. In the Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty interview clip, Bolton made no mention of any illicit quid pro quo, and acknowledged, as Republicans have claimed, that combating corruption in Ukraine was a high priority for the Trump administration.

In the weeks leading up to the November election, for example, Twitter banned the account of the New York Post for a story discussing an investigation into Hunter Biden even though the Department of Justice later confirmed the investigation was taking place. This rule change will hand Democrats and their allies in Silicon Valley another weapon to wield against Republicans whose opinions they dislike.

ROVE: Yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of Comey. This was leaked to The New York Times, which says something about the culture inside the FBI. The only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since Comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, Mueller is appointed. This was probably immediately subsumed by Mueller -- the Mueller investigation and has been, I suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.

It is therefore no surprise that Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the term Democratic socialism. Another new House member Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.

Aside from those who depend on food assistance, the partial government shutdown has also hindered advocacy groups combating domestic and sexual violence.

How does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.

In the aftermath of that 2016 attempted knee-capping of candidate Trump, I was especially struck by Romney's ostentatious moral preening. This week he returned, standing upon his same well-tended molehill of superiority to again point at and accuse the president of, sigh, being a bad, bad man.
TRUMP: I don't see it happening. We are there for a very, very strong reason. They cannot have nuclear weapons. The Iran nuclear deal signed by President Obama gave 150 billion and that's when the real terrorist started. They took that money and they used it all over the place. You look at Yemen, you look at all of the things that were happening including Syria. They were using, Pallister (ph) gave 1.8 billion in cash, 1.7, 1.8 billion in cash. Green cash, beautiful green cash. You almost - how do they have the power to do this plane load of cash and instead of Iran saying, thank you very much. It's really nice. Let's go and get along. Let's do well. Let's do deals together. Let's build buildings in Iran. They said, Death to America and they said it when they were signing.

TRUMP: I saw the reports that they were -- put -- assigned people in the Ukrainian Embassy, apparently, to monitor myself, other conservative figures, Sean Hannity, Dan Bongino, numerous others. So, of course, now it's -- now she's accusing people of doing the same to her, because that's what happens. When they do it, it's sort of the -- what -- the old liberal -- the Democrat politics, accuse them of doing all the things that you're doing. So, a year later, they come back to try to accuse us of it.
WALLACE: OK, I want to switch subjects. The New York Times now reports that after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, that the bureau opened up a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was working on behalf of the Russians. One, did you know about that? Two, what do you think -- I have to say, it's an astonishing idea.
In the middle of that, lashing out with political attacks against a TV show. She went after the President by name. What does that say about her?
It's the Democrats position of appeasement toward Iran that's endangered American interests and allies for years and years. If our position, a friend of mine gave me this idea, I wish I could claim it as my own. But if our position right now, we listen to the Democrats is that we cannot eliminate a known and unrepentant terrorist for fear of reprisals from his homeland. Then that means the situation in the region is truly hopeless.

Saba Farzan, the German-Iranian executive director of Foreign Policy Circle, a strategy think tank in Berlin, told Fox News, The continued systematic persecution of Christians in Iran requires a tough response by the U.S. and its allies. Hard economic sanctions should be backed by a very visible campaign of naming and shaming the Iranian Islamic tyranny for denying its own citizens an absolute basic human right: freedom of religion. Especially the U.S. with its rich history of religious freedom and tolerance is seen by so many Iranians from all walks of life as a shining example. To back Iranian Christians is an important step to achieve freedom for all Iranians.

I just read an article about how Bernie was thrown out of a commune because he didn't want to do any work. He wanted to talk about politics all day. The commune was all about self-sufficiency, growing your own food. So Bernie is making the case for being a bum, and there's a little bit of us that wants to do that.

Partly because walls are only a delaying obstacle, building them is only half the issue. After their construction, they need to be constantly monitored—often the harder task, even with advanced technology. In this sense, the Israeli effort around Gaza is particularly instructive. The Israeli-Gaza border after all is comparatively tiny, about 60 kilometers or less than a fiftieth the length of United States-Mexican border, and the Israelis still need to devote ample technological resources and manpower to watching it. And even so, these walls have not been foolproof.

Young, a social worker, was inside her home in February 2019 when police stormed in, serving a search warrant for what ended up being the wrong address. Young was not allowed to put her clothes on before police handcuffed her and even after she told them several times that they had the wrong home, according to video first released by Chicago's WBBM-TV.
But if people play games with the witnesses and, all of a sudden, we have one side and we have John Bolton who has an ax to grind about being fired coming in, but we don't let the president call witnesses he wishes to call, I think all hell's going to break loose, and I think the Republican electorate will boot out any of these people who allow this to be a one- sided episode.
MICHAEL SHEAR, NEW YORK TIMES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: We have still never seen what the President's legal defense of all of this is. We have seen his political defense, right? We have seen letters from Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel which are largely political arguments and we've seen the House members, the Jim Jordans of the world making largely political responses. We've never yet seen an actual legal defense.

The relentless pace means that more than a quarter of all federal appeals court judges were nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats are doing everything we can to slow down the judicial train, but they changed the rules,″ referring to McConnell reducing the amount of debate time for a nominee from 30 hours to just two.
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The precedent in impeachment trials in the Senate is to have witnesses. To have no witnesses would be a dramatic break with precedent. It would mean the first impeachment trial of a President in history with no witnesses. The first impeachment trial of anybody that went to completion in the Senate's 200 and some odd year history without witnesses.

The president has shown a willingness to compromise. You heard it. In a funding request to the Senate Appropriations Committee this week,he asks for items important to Democrats, including, $800 million for humanitarian needs at the border, such as medical support and additional facilities to house migrants - which, frankly, a lot of Americans probably think would be better spent on inner-city youth and on our veterans.

But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men.

It would be easy to dismiss President Trump's decision to begin withdrawing from Afghanistan as simply a political decision in which Trump is making good on a campaign promise. The reality is that it reflects what Americans want because they understand that a continued U.S. military presence Afghanistan no longer is in our national security interest— it's a conflict we don't need to fight, can't win, and can't afford.

So McConnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the American people. Not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. No, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt President Obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the American people. You can bet every penny you have that McConell feels the same way about our incoming president.

China perceived the lack of strategic focus of the George W. Bush administration and the passive lead from behind foreign policy of the Obama administration as American decay and decline. In reality, the foundational aspects of the American economy remain surprisingly strong and the American fighting spirit is not dead -- merely sleeping. Those who would believe that the sinking of two aircraft carriers would trigger an impulse toward retreat would do well to make themselves aware of the United States' history and the impact events such as the sinking of the Lusitania, the attack on Pearl Harbor and the collapse of the World Trade Center had on the national psyche. What some have labeled the Jacksonian impulse could be described as a tendency toward great power rage. To be sure, it burns itself out. After all, the U.S. is considering leaving Afghanistan, 17 years later.

It seems increasingly likely the United States is prepared to officially recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel. Acknowledging Israeli sovereignty over the strategically-critical heights would obviously be in Israel's interest, but also in the interest of the United States, explained Jonathan Ruhe, Associate Director, JINSA's Gemunder Center for Defense and Strategy. It would underscore U.S. support for Israel's self-defense, in particular against Iran and its proxies in neighboring Syria – an issue that's increasingly important as the United States reduces its own presence in that country and relies increasingly on its Middle East allies to push back against Tehran.

JOHNSON: I'm not sure what else John would really add to this. I haven't spoken to him since - we really talking about Ukraine. We share the same position, but from my standpoint, President Trump has been unbelievably consistent in why he had reservations about Ukraine.

In January, a three-judge court found that the map violated the Constitution and ordered the state to come up with a new plan quickly, in time for the 2018 elections.

There have been many calls for an independent, bipartisan investigation into the nursing home tragedy, especially after an internal NYS Health Department study (conducted by Cuomo's own administration) dismissed the COVID-19 recovering patients as the reason for the thousands of deaths, and instead blamed staff members and visitors.

In 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Mitt Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating.
Although the man at the center of this massive world-class fraud is Barack Obama, there are many moving parts and co-conspirators. These include famous billionaire businessmen, corporate CEOs, the Federal Reserve, Wall Street bankers, central bankers, government employee unions, the IRS, EPA, NSA, the Bar Association, assorted communists and America-haters, and even some well-known D.C. establishment Republicans. It's quite a shocking list of conspirators.

To demonstrate that point, Dershowitz made thinly veiled references to President Obama's refusal to send lethal military aid to Ukraine, as well as his failed, unenforced red line warning for Syria not to use chemical weapons.

CARLSON: Well, I think he may be close to one of my producers.
The government, either via policy change or court order, has made some changes to the no-fly list that have opened up the process somewhat. But everyone agrees, it's still a slow and secretive process.
Indeed, the question that has long dogged such proposals is how to pay for it all. But the answer has typically avoided specifics, instead arguing that America has found ways to pay for other gargantuan costs in the past. In a follow-up FAQ, one explainer says the plan would be funded by the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars.
INGRAHAM: Well, I think they've divided up witness by witness and argument by argument from the constitutional to the fact based arguments so I think that's already in process. Tom Fitton, what we've heard from the media are Cipollone is not a - he's not a media person. He's not done a lot of you know, sexy trial work so they're trying to like I guess, raise expectations, lower expectations for him. But I love the fact and you know, full disclosure, he's a close friend of mine so I know he's going to be fantastic but I love the fact that he's kind of an enigma to them because he's not someone who seeks the limelight. Well, any basic research into his background, he's an experienced attorney. My guess is he can handle politicians in the Senate and that process. You can see though why Nancy Pelosi didn't want the Senate trial to happen and that's why she obstructed it because now you're going to have all these politicians that they have pointed as impeachment managers come over and have to deal with real lawyers. I fear we're going to have a Kavanaugh type situation because in the ordinary course, the President's going to be vindicated in short order so they're going to think of ways to subvert that. This is why your motion for dismissal is a good idea. This is why they should knock Schiff out because he's conflicted.

TRUMP: I think that's what they believe, at the same time as I said before, he can't get through a sentence without stumbling. He's got real problems. I mean here's a man that was in the Senate for longer than I've been alive, Laura, right? Yet he blames all of America's problems on my father. It's kind of ironic how that works. Here's a guy who gave Iran $150 billion. They ended up building missiles that they did shot at one of our air bases. Here's a guy a guy who has a son, who profited in you know off of the presidency of the United States, of a vice presidency of United States, took $1.5 billion from China just a couple days ago. ABC reported that his brother was doing the same thing as it came to charter schools in Florida. This guy's got a lot of problems. This guy has a lot of problems aside from the fact that he lacks charisma and again, he hasn't exactly been a good mouth piece for them because he keeps on stumbling and going off on these terrible rants. He's got real problems.
This is why they oppose him, the established order. First off, they hating

You have all failed the American people today, and I hope you're going to fix things moving forward, Gomez's statement continues.
TRUMP: Well, they build an office building for $3 billion. They do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing before I got here. But I raised a lot of money. We can use NATO in other locations. We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East. And that's what we should do. I think frankly it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East, if an international force comes in rather than just the United States. And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved our troops out of Syria - on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect it. They've been fighting over that border for a thousand years. Why should we do it? And then they say, he left troops in Syria. You know what I did, I left troops to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have are taking the oil. They're protecting the oil. I took over the oil.
INGRAHAM: Yes, shuttle diplomacy, when he's no longer Secretary of State. Lee and Victor, fascinating. Thank you so much both of you. And we were told that the Democrats 2020 candidates were a veritable field of dreams. How many times have we hear that old trope? What happened? Well, my ANGLE explains next and then Dinesh D'Souza responds, it's going to be a doozy. Stay there.
MILLS: It's a joke. It's a joke. I mean, I think the real question is, why do we still have troops there? So you see the Baghdad embassy protests. And to be clear, this is not just an embassy. This is a fortress. It's been a fortress since we took out Saddam in 2003 and American troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages.

JORDAN: Yes. They were out to get the president. You had on Don Trump Jr. I thought it was a great interview. He said in impeachment started on Election Day. I actually think it started even sooner. I think it started on July 31, 2016, when they opened the Trump-Russia investigation, as I said, went and spied on four American citizens associated with the Trump campaign. And who was heading that investigation? Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, who said in one of those text messages, just went to a Southern Virginia Walmart. I can smell the Trump support. The disdain they have for the president and, just as importantly, the disdain they have for folks like you and me, Maria, who support the president, who voted for the president, that is what is so wrong. And then they get caught with these text messages. And now they're going to sue? This is ridiculous. The American people -- it's great that we -- those text messages were released, because the American can people can see the bias, the animus that these folks, who ran the two biggest investigations probably of our lifetime, the Clinton e-mail investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation, they can see the bias and the animus they had against President Donald Trump.

SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Remember, the attorney general can be impeached.
Chris Wallace: Josh, I want to move to a different aspect of the questions that people are asking this week. President Trump very publicly and has reaffirmed it as recently as this fall that the situation in Syria ran on getting the U.S. out of endless wars in the Middle East. But as I discussed with Secretary Pompeo, this week alone he sent more than 4,000 U.S. troops into the region. So, are we getting out? Are we getting deeper?
RAY: Well, that's a -- that's a relevant issue to consider, obviously, because, if you get into the question, as the Democrats have alleged, that anything having to do with the Bidens was completely, in their words, a sham, obviously, your views about that are affected by whether or not you think there was merit to a Biden investigation. But before we ever get to that, I think the core issue -- and Senator Cruz alluded to this -- well-founded -- and I have said this many times -- many times on your show -- well-founded articles of impeachment both allege that crimes were committed and that those are the type of crimes that constitute abuse of the public trust. Abuse of power alone -- and history has shown this -- similar to also obstruction of Congress, those types of articles of impeachment have been tried on for size before, but they have not fared well. The core of the impeachment parameters allege that crimes have been committed, treason, bribery, and things like that, in other words, other high crimes and misdemeanors.
BARTIROMO: Once again, they're colluding against Bernie Sanders.

Mike Pompeo: Well, Chris, the American people know that there's a strategy. There's a strategy that has been several years in the making now, that we've been working on. It's been a diplomatic strategy. It's been an economic strategy. You're now seeing elements of the military strategy. And with respect to targets, President Trump talked about 52 targets last night. That's not new in the following sense: we've made clear to the theocrats and kleptocrats that are running Iran today, running it into the ground against the will of their own people -- we made clear to them that we would not respond just against these proxy forces that they run, in Yemen, and in Syria, and in Iraq, and in Lebanon. We made clear that this cost would be brought home to them, to the leadership regime in Iran, and that we would raise costs. We wouldn't just attack their asymmetric efforts; we would respond in a way that imposes costs on the decision-makers who are putting American lives at risk.

CRUZ: I think it is certainly possible that this trial could last one to two weeks. On the other hand, if the Senate makes decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it six, eight weeks, or even longer. So I think there are really two paths here. But what you just noted there is important. This week is going to be the first time in a year that the president has had the opportunity to defend himself, to lay out the facts, to lay out the law, to lay out the actual substance. We have seen months and months and months of a one-sided show trial from House Democrats, where they didn't want to hear from the defense, where they shut out the White House, where they shut out the minority. The good news is, in the Senate, what I'm confident of is, we're going to have a fair trial. We're not going to give in to the kind of games that House Democrats have played. Instead, we're going to give both sides a full and fair opportunity to present their case. The House managers will have every opportunity to stand up and to present their arguments, to put forth whatever evidence they have. But for the first time, the president and the White House defense team is going to be able to walk through the facts and substance. And I think that's a very, very important development.

The consultant, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, added that it was very problematic for our candidates. Any private conversations on why they lost is going to start with President Trump's actions over the past nine weeks.
December 18th, a great day for the Constitution of the United States, a sad one for America, that the president's reckless activities necessitated us -

We are aware of open source reports of reportedly American citizens currently in custody who were believed to be fighting for ISIS, Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, told Fox News in a statement. However, we are unable to confirm this information at this time. The incident is under investigation.
We have heard over and over again from Democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to President Trump? Why won't any of his people stand up to President Trump? Then Bill Barr does that with a brush back pitch that I think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.
John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, said on Monday that he was willing to testify at President Trump's impeachment trial if subpoenaed. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify, Mr. Bolton said in a statement on his website.
Mike Pompeo: Panicked aggression on the part of the Iranian leadership, because they know that the Iranian people are demanding enormous change. And they know that the Iranian people are supported by America in that demand for change. Yeah. We've built out a huge coalition, Chris. Gulf states, Israel, countries all across the whole world who are joining us. They are joining us not only in the efforts in the Strait of Hormuz, but in air defense efforts all across the region. The malign actor of Iran has been identified. Remember where we came in, Chris. Remember where we came in. In 2015, the Obama-Biden administration essentially handed power to the Iranian leadership and acted as a quasi-ally of theirs, by underwriting them -- underwriting the very malicious -- that killed Americans. Those resources, the money that they had to build out those forces throughout the Shi'a Crescent was provided to them by the nuclear deal. We allowed Europeans to go do business there. We provided them $150 billion, pallets of cash. All of these things are the very challenge that the Trump administration has had to correct. The strategy is working. We're going to stay the course. And we will protect and defend the American people at every step, Chris.

I mean, Congressman, the president is not making this up.
Israel is self-sufficient in oil. The Arab street is on our side, it's anti-Iranian and the Palestinians have lost their global resonance.
Well, the mob busy pushing the psychotic anti-Trump conspiracy theories, they did miss the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history, and it was happening right before their eyes.

Forbes' editor, Randall Lane, issued a public warning marked by photos of Kellyanne Conway, Sean Spicer, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Kayleigh McEnany: Hire any of Trump's fellow fabulists above, and Forbes will assume that everything your company or firm talks about is a lie.

Chris Wallace: Iran's leaders are vowing a crushing response using words like a hard revenge. What do we do if they strike back, if they retaliate? Is there a plan and is there -- because of the fact that we went after Soleimani -- has there been a change in U.S. response where we're no longer going to go after the enemy in the field we're now going to go after Iran's command and control.
KERIK: Well, listen, all you have to do is look what's happened in the last week, in the last 24 hours. This thing should be reversed. The Mayor should be screaming out of his mind to get it reversed.

It is indisputable that nobody has been more successful at using digital media than President Trump to communicate directly with the American people, but it's incredibly ironic, yet not surprising, that when the President spoke to the country at a critical time Big Tech chose to censor and block him from doing so, Deere told Fox News. Big Tech is out of control.
Georgia, the election, including the Senate run, was, quote, illegal and
And Trump is saying, we reacted. I showed restraint. Now it's your turn, see what you're going to do, and I don't think they're going to do what everybody thinks we're going to do, because they don't really have any options.
WOLF: It's no question about it.
The first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens, the letter says. The Withdrawal Agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Democratic field is obviously big. It's more diverse than many other years.
Political appointees are the president's arms and legs in the vast bureaucracy. That's the purpose of the appointee. You don't get to call your own terms, you don't get to set your own policies. I think this is the greatest frustration for the president.

TRUMP: We said we wouldn't do any new international deals going forward. And that's -- hey, a big part of why I'm so involved in politics right now is because that's what I did. I did our international deals. Unlike Hunter Biden, we were actually international businesspeople before daddy got into politics, OK? Hunter Biden magically becomes an international business the second his father's pulling the purse strings. OK? That's the difference. Now, people don't want to talk about that. They don't want to talk about that.
GREEN: I think we find, you know, some common ground with what is border security and we get it done. I mean that's really what we have to do. And, you know, the president has looked at this and has said, this is what we need to do and, you know, I'm supporting him in this -- in this effort.
And jobs? You were told in June we created 288,000 new jobs. What the media forgot to tell you is that 525,000 full-time middle class jobs were LOST in June and 800,000 part-time crappy low wage jobs were created. Does that sound like good news to you? No, it's more murder of the middle class.

The two things the Democratic House have done now legislatively, they've introduced a bill to -- on voting rights, to get corruption out of Washington, and they've passed bills to reopen the government. So I think they put down a marker this week that they are not here to play. They have an agenda. They're going to push it forward.

As one of his first orders of business on Monday, Newsom declared his intent to reinstate the ObamaCare individual mandate at the state level.

But—however desirable a representative, multiethnic, democratic government in Afghanistan would be—it is not an absolute necessity for U.S. national security. The overriding requirement is that whatever government controls Afghanistan, it understands that the United States will not tolerate support for or the harboring of any terrorist group with global reach that directly threatens the United States—even if such a government is not a friendly government. Al Qaeda and ISIS are terrorist threats in Afghanistan, but neither are a direct, existential threat to the American homeland.

Last Friday, Trump raised the stakes saying that the shutdown wasn't about $3 billion but rather about a comprehensive immigration reform effort. That may be too much in the other direction since such a goal is unlikely to be achieved, but it's certainly raises the stakes to a point that seems worth the trouble.

Oil independence was a fantasy as recently as a decade ago, when the experts were warning of peak oil. In 2011, former President Barack Obama said, The United States of America cannot afford to bet our long-term prosperity, our long-term security, on a resource [oil] that will eventually run out. The biggest benefits of energy independence, however, are economic. The U.S. energy production bonanza is responsible for significantly reducing energy prices, with the price of oil falling by about one third over the last decade, adjusted for inflation. At the most basic level, lower energy prices mean better economic prospects for ordinary Americans and small businesses.

In the end, Qatar did not have to accede to any of the demands. It also appears that the coming Biden administration taking the reins of U.S. foreign policy could have also have played a part in accelerating a resolution. Stemming the Iran nuclear program, which appears to be advancing, with Tehran's announcement that it is increasing its enrichment of uranium to 20%, is a worrying development both in Washington and in the region.

And secondly, you know they've got this false choice that they're throwing out there, either we do nothing and continue to appease the terrorists, or we have World War III with D-Day style invasions of Tehran. There is a lot of room in between. There is a lot of options. That is not on the table and nor does the President need authorization to defend our embassies, to defend our troops to strike back and to stop this escalation. He's absolutely right. We're preventing further war. We're not escalating into war. We're stopping Iran's escalation. And I think it was absolutely the right move.

INGRAHAM: Remember, when Bill Marr got into all that trouble for saying the9/11 attackers were a reference and as courageous. What are these guys doing? Whereas Bush was too idealistic about what was possible in Iraq and whereas Obama was too defeatist about Iran, Trump's a realist, he's a pragmatist.

And particularly given the history, where we've had the politicizing of intelligence over WMD [weapons of mass destruction], why we would pick someone who the very same issue has been raised repeatedly, and that is John Bolton's politicization of the intelligence he got on Cuba and other issues, why we would want someone with that lack of credibility, I can't understand, Schiff had said.

In fact, they might want to send a message to the GOP about the way their senators have been behaving.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., reignited the call for a Green New Deal during her surge to Congress in the midterm elections. Her plan is a lofty one, calling for the federal government to invest trillions of dollars. In turn, she says, millions of high-wage jobs will be created. She compared her plan to the Marshall Plan, or the European Recovery Plan, where the U.S. gave around $15 billion to help Western Europe recover in the aftermath of World War II.

We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East. And that's what we should do. I think frankly it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East, if an international force comes in rather than just the United States. And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved our troops out of Syria - on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect it. They've been fighting over that border for a thousand years. Why should we do it? And then they say, he left troops in Syria.

Chris Van Hollen: Well, because you have to look at what the consequences are, right? We don't go around killing all the very bad people in the world. We have President Trump embracing Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea who's got a lot of blood on his hands and is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier, an American citizen, and yet he's getting love letters from the president of the United States. So, the question is, do we further our interests by killing Soleimani? And everything we've seen is we've actually increased the risks of war dramatically, we've put Americans at greater threat, and we seem to have accomplished Soleimani and the Iranians' main goal, which is to undermine our influence and support in Iraq. We now have the top Iraqi leadership, the president and the prime minister, condemning the United States' action. We have Parliament meeting to talk about expelling U.S. forces. What was Soleimani's main goal in Iraq? It was to get the Americans out, to undermine our influence. So, we seem to have accomplished what Soleimani was trying to do but couldn't, so in death he's actually accomplished his goal. That is a -- that turns back U.S. interests in the region.

Chris Wallace: Iran's leaders are vowing a crushing response using words like a hard revenge. What do we do if they strike back, if they retaliate? Is there a plan and is there -- because of the fact that we went after Soleimani -- has there been a change in U.S. response where we're no longer going to go after the enemy in the field we're now going to go after Iran's command and control.

The Constitution grants the President no unilateral authority to withhold funds from obligation, the opinion said.

I understand all of that. And there's a lot of bad faith on both sides. Why not make a deal?
Josh Holmes: Well, I don't think that's inconsistent at all. I mean, I think his overarching policy as Secretary Pompeo articulated very clearly is to remove America from these endless wars and these conflicts in Syria, the conflicts in Iraq and beyond, but that also cannot override immediate security threats. You need to be responsive to that and I will just say, I'm totally stunned at the notion that somehow America is the one that is bringing this to a higher escalation level. The president's critics may not have been paying attention to what's happened over the last couple of years, but just because they're more focused on trying to impeach the president of the United States than the health and well-being of American soldiers in Iraq, doesn't mean that things aren't happening. This guy has tried -- has killed over 600 American soldiers, all right? Just last week, we watched him storm the embassy in Baghdad. Now, how America is the aggressor here is beyond me but what they did is for the first time in a long time, and I'll argue that the president has been extremely reluctant to engage in this kind of thing, but first time in a long time tell Iran not anymore. You're not going to be attacking American assets or American personnel without severe repercussions and I think that's a great thing for this country.

I'm not sure I would call it a rift, but between Bill Barr saying what he said on ABC News, and then his Justice Department declining to prosecute Andrew McCabe, an outcome that I think it's very clear the president wants, to Michael's point -- I think it's been about few days for the narrative that Bill Barr is just a hatchet man for President Trump who will do his bidding.

So nobody should mourn the demise of general Soleimani And the president did operate within his constitutional authority. I think what we've just been discussing and the disarray of the House over this impeachment matter shows the wisdom of the founding fathers giving these sort of decisions under the Constitution to the commander in chief and not 535 members of Congress. I think the contrast between the way that the death of Osama bin Laden was greeted on a bipartisan basis in the way now that Soleimani death is being greeted on a partisan basis, is tells tells the story.

JARRETT: The prosecutors in the House had a chance to subpoena people like Bolton or Mick Mulvaney or Rudy Giuliani. They didn't do it. The one subpoena they issued, they withdrew and now all of a sudden, Nancy Pelosi is trying to engage in a quid pro quo to extort the Senate to do the job that the House was supposed to do. At the same time accusing the President of an impeachable quid pro quo. The hypocrisy and irony is, lost on no one.
Cuomo has said the original directive was in line with guidance from the Trump administration's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Centers from Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that went out to all states on how to control infections in nursing homes. The guidance said nursing homes should admit any individuals that they would normally admit to their facility, including individuals from hospitals where a case of COVID-19 was/is present.

Nothing would be more foolish and dangerous than not strengthening our might tirelessly and having an easy-going attitude at a time when we clearly see the enemy's state-of-the-art weapons are being increased more than ever, Kim said. The reality is that we can achieve peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula when we constantly build up our national defense and suppress U.S. military threats.
Danon: I think it was crucial. You can say a lot of things about the agreement with Iran, but one good that happened is it brought us together. Today we have very close relationships. I served in the U.N. for five years, we did it quietly but now we are doing it publicly. And I think you'll hear the same voices now publicly coming [from] Riyadh, Abu Dhabi, Tel Aviv, and many other countries in the Middle East.

INGRAHAM: Does it not show the weakness of their case, but they're still trying to rebrand this as something else?
WALLACE: Let me just interrupt for a second, because Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Schumer have been hinting at this on Friday after the meeting, is that the Democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government?
Chris Wallace: With the Senate back in session, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer making no progress in agreeing on ground rules for an impeachment trial of President Trump. And we're back now with the panel. So, Josh, where are we on a Senate trial? Is your former boss there, Mitch McConnell, is he going to hold firm and say, Nancy Pelosi, you're not going to dictate what's going to happen here? And secondly, you had -- over the recess, you had two Republican senators -- Collins and Murkowski -- both express concerns about McConnell's hardline stance. What do you think of the chances that McConnell holds firm, that you could get them and maybe two other Republicans -- which would give Democrats, potentially, a majority -- to call witnesses and basically run the kind of trial the Democrats want to?

This is as The New York Times reported that the FBI allegedly looked into whether or not the president was secretly working on behalf of Russia during and following the 2016 campaign, a suggestion that drew a scathing rebuke from the president's attorney John Dowd who wrote The New York Times story is an unwitting disclosure and verification of the utter corruption of their oaths by Comey and his colleagues to undermine the free election of the president of the United States.

Today, Japanese health authorities began allowing passengers to disembark from the Diamond Princess, which had been under quarantine. However, Americans on board the cruise ship received letters from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo informing them they will not be permitted to return to the U.S. for an additional 14 days after leaving the ship, which is now tied to more than 600 confirmed cases of coronavirus.
For China, it is better to get its more bellicose voices under control and approach the bargaining table with the United States over trade issues in good faith and with an openness to real compromise on the economic issues that divide our two nations, rather than resorting to nationalist saber rattling.

All viruses evolve, and very rarely a virus will change in a way that requires us to re-evaluate public health policy, added Dr. Erik Volz, a scientist at Imperial College London and one of the study authors, in a statement.

Does good parenting mean letting kids decide? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. If your kid is invited to two different parties this Saturday, it's reasonable to let your kid decide which party to attend. But if your 12-year-old wants to drink a vodka tonic or two, just to see what it feels like, that's not such a great idea. Alcohol is toxic and can be addictive. The younger the child, the greater the risks. For 12-year-olds, the risks of drinking alcohol clearly outweigh the benefits.

HEMINGWAY: And people really should be skeptical when they are told things. The previous two presidents had problems trusting intelligence that they shouldn't have trusted. You can never get mad at people for asking to the goods on intelligence or being skeptical that another president will embroil us in a war in the Middle East. But yes, you need to check your facts, and you need to not fall for conspiracy theories and whatnot. And that's not happening.
BARTIROMO: Yes, they got caught, but will they actually face accountability, Congressman? You mentioned Rod Rosenstein. And now the story going viral this weekend is that Rosenstein said that he authorized the release of the Page-Strzok texts.

Bolton also called Trump's communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warm and cordial, without mentioning any misconduct.

Real quick, before we get to technology, Senator, in terms of that resolution, is there any concern that you have got, the senators, basically having allegiance to Joe Biden? He's served 36 years in the Senate. There are some senators who will be -- quote, unquote -- jurors who are running for president. Of course they have a -- they have their motive. And then there are others who perhaps have an allegiance to Joe Biden.

And it's part of a larger narrative. They're really angry about the Soleimani death. But Donald Trump was very deliberate. He explained what happened. He didn't go to the White House Correspondents Dinner like Obama did and joke about predator assassination.
PRAGER: Well, I won't -- I don't know what Adam's position is on this. But I think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong. I don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong.

Tucker Carlson: As well as in the campaign against ISIS. Though he was little known to the American public, Soleimani was among the most famous living figures in Iran and also among the most powerful. According to some accounts, second only to the supreme leader of that country. The Iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge against the U.S. in response to his death. Now whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. But it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs we could be engaged in a conflict, a real conflict, with Iran. From Iran's perspective we're already there. If Iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff, for example, would you consider it an act of war? You would. So, what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've seen in Syria, it was a pivot point. Neo-cons in Washington understood that immediately. Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qasem Soleimani, tweeted disgraced former national security advisor John Bolton. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran. That of course has been the neo-con objective all along. The president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that regime change and war are not the point at all.
Chris Wallace: Finally, some analysts suggest that the impeachment of President Trump has emboldened enemies like Iran and North Korea to think that they can confront him.

But Romney was singing a different tune in 2012 during his presidential bid. After Donald Trump endorsed him in February 2012, saying Mitt is tough, he's sharp, he's smart, Romney replied in a speech at the Trump Hotel Las Vegas when he said: Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and getting his endorsement is a delight. I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement, and of course, I'm looking for the endorsement of the people of Nevada.

Now, Pelosi is the highest-ranking Democrat in the United States. She's the leader of her party. So, we should not blow this off. We should take it seriously. As a matter of policy, Democrats believe a border wall is immoral. And that raises the question, what do they consider moral?
WALLACE: Now the president weighs declaring a national emergency and funding the wall.
The relentless pace means that more than a quarter of all federal appeals court judges were nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats are doing everything we can to slow down the judicial train, but they changed the rules,″ referring to McConnell reducing the amount of debate time for a nominee from 30 hours to just two.

WALLACE: Simple question. Does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened?
TRUMP: It went up three percent and it went up 2.9 percent. In the last two year, wages have gone up more than they have 25 years.
But, yes, overall, I think the economy has the wind at its back. And I think one reason we're seeing these record highs day after day, and we're going to see him probably tomorrow, too, after tonight's debate, you're going to see the Democrats continue to fray, and that's why the markets like it, because it gives Trump a better chance in November to pull this out.

I think good parenting means letting kids decide.

Mann says you may not even have to be suspected of terrorism to get on a no-fly list. In some cases, people have either open warrants or some other characteristic indicating criminal activity and then they find themselves on this list, he says, even when the alleged activity has nothing to do with aviation security. Mann believes that's a sign the no-fly list has morphed beyond an air security tool into an all-out law enforcement tactic. This has mission-creeped into something that is much wider in scope than was originally intended, he says.
These actions are what fueled the impeachment effort against Trump, whose trial technically gets underway Thursday and moves into full swing next week.

Should the White House move forward with an emergency declaration, it has a handful of legal routes to take. The National Emergencies Act grants the president broad authority to declare emergencies, and several federal laws then could clear a path for the White House to move ahead with building a wall.

Beyond sexual harassment, the committee's findings also cast a disturbing light on the ad hoc approach to soldiers who do not show up for duty. They are automatically labeled Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL), with few resources dedicated to finding them or learning why they're missing.

The Writer's Almanac: On this date in 1610, Galileo wrote a letter describing his discovery of three of Jupiter's moons. He discovered them in December, after improving his telescope design. He wasn't sure at first they were moons; he thought they were fixed stars. He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers. Marius's names stuck, and today we know the moons as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

At issue is the administration's rule issued in August that would restrict immigrants entering the United States if the government believes they will rely on public assistance, such as housing or health care benefits. Lower federal courts had blocked the policy from being implemented while the issue is being litigated.

Fox News reached out to nearly two-dozen Democrats seen as potential 2020 candidates to ask about their position on the Green New Deal. Some voiced support for the plan or pointed Fox News to prior statements of support, though most did not respond to the requests for comment or declined to comment -- leaving open the possibility that more potential candidates could lend their support in the coming weeks.

CRUZ: Well, when will we get to final judgment, the president will have been acquitted forever of these bogus impeachment charges.
After a two-week vacation here in Florida, the president makes his way back home, where he'll be considering entanglements abroad and a possible impeachment trial here in the states. Chris.
Fires Erupt, Vandalism Reported at Anti-Trump Protest in Oakland - ABC 7
VAN DREW: But I want her to know that we're all thinking about her. Secondly, to answer your question, look, the House had its time. They have spent months and months and months of reports, of investigations, millions upon millions of dollars. And we finally, the House, came up with two articles of impeachment, both of which are very weak. I will say this, and I will say it over and over again, because I think people must understand how important it is. Impeachment is a tool that is not meant to be used anywhere near a regular basis. Our founding fathers almost disliked it. It was said even by de Tocqueville, who was a famous Frenchman who loved America, that, when impeachment was used too often, that it was a sign of the degeneration of the country and the breakdown of the United States of America.
MULVANEY: Yes, I think the 25th Amendment is a very clumsy tool. We've
Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute noted that the U.S. only emits a fraction of the global carbon dioxide emissions – meaning proposals included in the Green New Deal would only go so far in helping the climate without changes in other places, such as China or India.
Now, the left's latest desperate attempt to smear President Trump, keep his impeachment charade alive, forever -- it's insane. Earlier in the week, there you go, we got the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar himself, Adam Schiff, he attached an addendum to the articles of impeachment. He's got new evidence, filled with random documents from a Ukrainian-American named Lev Parnas.
Facebook suspended the president's account for the first time Wednesday night after posting a video telling protesters who stormed the Capitol Building, erupting in violent protests that led to multiple deaths, to go home, while maintaining that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.
Ossoff is a Georgia native, media executive, investigative journalist, and small-business owner. He also previously worked as a national security aide for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., handling defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and economic policy issues.
REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: What the president is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders.
Of course, the reason why you wouldn't tell someone is the fear that they're not going to give you any consent. So the state that talks about affirmative consent when it comes to HIV infection, all of a sudden they're saying, oh, you know, it's not that important.
Joining us now from Delaware, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Up next, Trump has once again lured the left into defending what most of us think is indefensible. It doesn't stop them. Mollie Hemingway, Mike Huckabee are here, and they're going to tell us why liberals keep falling into this trap.
TEXAS COUPLE: GOD 'PURPOSEFULLY CONNECTED' US TO KIDS FOUND CHAINED IN HORRIFIC ABUSE CASE
Methamphetamine is still big business in Minnesota and Drug Trafficking Organizations bring meth to major metropolitan hubs like Chicago and Minneapolis then break down the product for mid-level dealers, said Faribault Police Chief and Violent Crime Coordinating Council Chair Andy Bohlen was quoted as saying. Eventually, the drug continues to spread and ends up in all communities across the state.
Bill D'Elia, a spokesman for North Carolina Republican state Senate leader Phil Berger, said Friday that Democrats have been looking for much of this decade to find judges who will redraw maps that will boost their candidates. We hope the Supreme Court finally puts this nonsense to rest and that Democrats go back to the old-fashioned way of winning elections: convincing people to vote for them, D'Elia said in an email.
While I cannot comment on the specifics of the New York Times report, I can say that counterintelligence concerns about those associated with the Trump campaign, including the President himself, have been at the heart of our investigation since the beginning, his statement said. Those concerns have not been alleviated by the Committee's work over the last two years; to the contrary, the abundance of meetings, contacts, and communications between Trump associates and the Russians, and the web of lies about those interactions, and the President's own statements and actions, have only heightened our need to follow the evidence wherever it may lead.
The Democratic chairman, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades representing areas of the Bronx and Westchester County, said that there wasn't a great clamor from lawmakers to keep the terrorism panel, formally called the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade subcommittee. Some of those responsibilities are expected to be redistributed to other subcommittees.
He added: But you have to go home now. We have to have peace, we have to have law and order we have to respect our great people in law and order. We don't want anyone hurt.
Pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us. The real threat is Iran. Well, they're liars. And they don't care about you. They don't care about your kids. They are reckless and incompetent. And you should keep all of that in mind, as war with Iran looms closer tonight.
WALLACE: Well, OK. Let me --
No matter their original purpose, some basic principles behind walls remain timeless. Walls do work, at least for a time. There is a reason, after all, why states across the centuries have turned to walls as solutions to strategic quagmires. As mentioned before, walls have proven notably effective in places like Iraq in tamping down violence. That said, walls also have a shelf-life. In military parlance, walls are delaying obstacles. They can slow down the attacker and in best-case scenarios deter them from attacking in the first place by making the effort not worth the reward. But no historical wall has proven impregnable. Determined adversaries have been able to breach them or tunnel under them in time. Despite Israel's technological edge, Hamas has infiltrated under the walls around Gaza. North Korea was able to tunnel into the demilitarized zone toward South Korea, despite it being one of the most fortified areas of the world.
Lankford, a member of the committee with oversight of the agency that facilitates presidential transitions, said on Tulsa talk radio: I will step in as well to be able to push to say: 'This needs to occur.' So that regardless of the outcome of the election — whichever way that it goes — people can be ready for that actual task.
Bolton's comments mark the first public confirmation that the drawdown has been slowed, as Trump faced widespread criticism from allies and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis for a policy that was to have been conducted within weeks.

Coming up, we bid adieu to someone who gave us great joy. Stay there.
Emphasizing that he's not abandoning his security argument, Trump said in a fundraising email Tuesday: I want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!
But the American Humanist Association, or AHA, disagrees, blasting the new plates as unconstitutional.
A spokesperson for the governor did not return Fox News' request for comment as to whether his office planned to release the documents and why it had not done so.
INGRAHAM: How you're going to collect.
PINION: Well, look, I think -- again, I think Republicans have to be careful what we wish for. Again, I think that when you look at somebody like Bernie, all the symptoms and signs are there for the same things that people said about President Trump, that he's only getting 30 percent of the vote, that there are more people voting for somebody...
