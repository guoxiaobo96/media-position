{"original": "graham: let's start with the president. i ask him, mr. president if you want to go down the emergency path, i stand with you. he said just 30 minutes ago, that's my last option. i think the legislative route is the best way to go, let's make a deal, but i will do it if i have to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. i am going to support him. before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and i think we are almost there, i would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. if we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. that's my recommendation.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "having said all that, i'm going to ask the fbi director, was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the russians? i find it astonishing and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the fbi, mccabe and that crowd. i don't trust them as far as i throw them.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i've asked him those questions, and i'm very comfortable with those answers. so, i think you'd be a great attorney general, great job by the president to pick mr. barr. i see no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and the russians, but that would be up to mr. mueller to make his report to attorney general and he soon will i hope.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but my democratic colleagues felt when they were in charge, we should confirm judges by majority vote. they changed the rules to accommodate president obama. they tried to stack the court. they never thought clinton would lose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, what you're going to have is harry reid and chuck schumer's desire to stack the court on their democratic watch has come back to haunt them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if there is an opening, whether it's ginsburg or anybody else, i will urge the president to nominate a qualified conservative and hopefully those people will get through, that person will get through and i expect it to be along party lines.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i hope justice ginsburg serves for a long time, but there's an opening on this court, i'm going to be hell-bent to put a conservative to replace whoever steps down for whatever reason.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: and just, finally, and i got about 30 seconds left, if you got donald trump -- and again, this is if -- you have donald trump replacing a liberal icon like ruth bader ginsburg, isn't that a formula for -- i mean, doesn't that make the kavanaugh hearings look like a tea party?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "graham: they should have thought of that before they changed the rules. they try to destroy conservative judges. i voted for sotomayor and kagan understanding what i was getting. so this decision by reid and schumer may come back to haunt them, but i am dead set on making sure it is a conservative nominee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and elections have consequences. the rules of the senate were changed not by me, by them, and we had to do it on the supreme court because they would not give us any votes to nominate anybody and kavanaugh was a fine man, they tried to destroy him. all this is going to come back to haunt them one day.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "coons: well, i agree with the advice that lindsey graham just gave to president trump, which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. what i think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. the humanitarian crisis i think may have been what she was referring to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the larger point here, chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. far from it. all of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. and the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: so, let's -- you're exactly right. i -- you have voted for a border barrier in the past and i've been looking at your records, so let's put it up on the screen. in 2013, as part of comprehensive immigration reform, you supported $46 billion for border security, including 350 miles of new fencing. in 2018, last year, you and most senate democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so here's the question: i understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of democrats, including pelosi, including schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. so why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that lindsey graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on dreamers and on tps immigrants?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "coons: chris, it would be great. if we could reach a resolution to our country's broken immigration system and find a path forward, we all agree to invest in border security, in new technologies and approaches that would actually make us safer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one of the challenges of negotiating with president trump, as lindsey graham knows better than anyone else, is i feel like i've signed up for the trump of the day club. i don't know what position we're going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two. it was senator graham who famously talked about tuesday trump and thursday trump when he and senator durbin brought a comprehensive resolution, a bill, to president trump last year, he embraced on tuesday and then walked away and announced it on thursday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place. majority leader mitch mcconnell put a bill on the floor that was adopted unanimously by the senate at the end of last year that would have kept the government open and supported 1.3 billion in border security. the president reversed position the next day and rejected something he told mitch mcconnell he would sign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "why is mitch mcconnell completely absent from these negotiations? it's because he doesn't really know what the president will accept.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "coons: i don't expect the president to capitulate. i do expect them to compromise.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we are clearly not going to build a border wall funded by mexico but we should negotiate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: forgive me -- but, congressman (ph), the question is will nancy pelosi compromise? the republican say, and you heard what lindsey graham just said, she's unwilling to give any money for the wall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i understand the issue with president trump and he certainly has reversed course a few times. what i'm asking you now, and this is -- we are in week four of the shutdown, so the situation has become dire.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: are you, are the democrats willing to make a compromise that includes money for a border wall fencing -- a border barrier i will call it -- in return for some concessions from the president on people in this country illegally?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "coons: i think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. look, chris, you know me, i work with republicans regularly. i've been on the phone with a half-dozen democratic and republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by vice president mike pence.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "wallace: what you think about the report in the new york times that in 2017, the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the united states was a russian agent?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "coons: well, that was a concerning, even alarming report and it suggests to me that the mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion. i'm grateful for the partnership of senator graham, now the chairman of the judiciary committee, in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with senators tillis and booker to protect the mueller investigation, and i think that report by the new york times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will also say this, chris -- i was very concerned by president trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that vladimir putin's russia had interfered in our 2016 election. there's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of president trump to complement president putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for president putin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think what we can all agree on is that the mueller investigation should reach its conclusion --", "augmented": []}

{"original": "coons: i'm keeping an open mind. we had a very constructive meeting this past week. i did ask him a number of questions right along those lines and will ask them again in the public confirmation hearing. i would need a firm commitment that he would not allow any interference in the mueller investigation, he will allow it to reach its conclusion and he will release the report to the public.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i also asked him about seeking an ethics opinion from the department of justice about whether he should recuse himself given some of the opinions he's expressed both in a memo that he sent unsolicited, challenging the obstruction of justice basis for some of robert mueller's investigation. he didn't make that commitment. he said it would depend on the facts at the time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i will re-ask that question this coming week. i have some other concerns about his views on criminal justice and civil rights. but the mueller investigation, the rule of law, his willingness to defend the appropriate independence of the department of justice will be critical to my vote.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: and briefly, sir, i want to pick up on the conversation i was having with senator graham, given justice ginsburg's recent illness, the fact that she is going to be turning 86 in march, it's only understandable that there would be some discussion about the possibility of replacing her at some point.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "coons: well, frankly, i think the confirmation of justice gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end. what made the confirmation hearings of justice kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "coons: i have talked with republican colleagues about finding a way that we have a clearer process for welcoming and vetting and making part of the confirmation process any such allegations so they don't arise at the last moment. i think there was a great deal of consternation over the timing of those allegations and then how seriously they were taken and investigated - - or not.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rove: yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of comey. this was leaked to the new york times, which says something about the culture inside the fbi. the only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, mueller is appointed. this was probably immediately subsumed by mueller -- the mueller investigation and has been, i suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "williams: i think it's up to mueller. it's up to mueller to say this is, one, provable and part of my ultimate report. you do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation. and this is unprecedented. the fbi, as you said, going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn, a manchurian candidate, for the russians. but what we can say, and i -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. michael cohen is not going to testify before congress. i think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. and right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 pennsylvania avenue. there something going on.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what we now know is that the -- the fbi formalized what mccabe, strzok, lisa page and all others have been doing for a matter of months before that point of view. they believed in their core of core that the president of the united states was a foreign agent and they were going to conduct investigations come hell or high water. this provided a perfect excuse for them to do so.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: i want to go quickly to this and then move on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "harman: ok. no. and i think that what you said, chris, is right. this is a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. and if they have had real evidence that the president was a manchurian candidate, i think they would have intervene right then. i mean we can't have that go on -- an unprecedented whatever i -- collusion, cooperation, arrangement with one of our most important, strategic competitors, russia.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "my hope is, is that our withdraw from syria, i assume that the president's going to fulfill it, is done in an orderly fashion. but let's recognize our withdrawal empowers russia, it empowers iran, it empowers the syrians. and the ultimate result of it may be iranian-supported militias on the northern border of israel, which is anathema to our interests and our allies.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "chris wallace: let me just interrupt. i understand that that's happened in the past. are you saying it's happening now?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris van hollen: i'm saying that they have an obligation to present the evidence. they did not notify the gang of 8. the one opportunity they had, just two days ago, to brief senior staff at the top secret level, they provided no evidence to support their claim of an imminent threat. look, everybody knows that soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy. there's no debate there. but the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported. and what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting americans at greater risk. in fact, secretary pompeo's own state department, right after these attacks, urged americans to leave iraq. so, obviously, they thought it was a more dangerous situation there the day after than the day before, and as you've just reported, we sent 4,000 additional troops to iraq, this from a president claiming he wants to get out of wars in the middle east.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris wallace: all right, but there's no question, and you certainly would agree, that soleimani was our enemy. he had been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of hundreds of american soldiers during the iraq war. there's no question that he was -- he wasn't taking a vacation as he was traveling around the middle east this last week. he was making more plans for terror attacks, spreading iran's malign influence. why not kill him?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris van hollen: well, because you have to look at what the consequences are, right? we don't go around killing all the very bad people in the world. we have president trump embracing kim jong-un, the leader of north korea who's got a lot of blood on his hands and is responsible for the death of otto warmbier, an american citizen, and yet he's getting love letters from the president of the united states. so, the question is, do we further our interests by killing soleimani? and everything we've seen is we've actually increased the risks of war dramatically, we've put americans at greater threat, and we seem to have accomplished soleimani and the iranians' main goal, which is to undermine our influence and support in iraq. we now have the top iraqi leadership, the president and the prime minister, condemning the united states' action. we have parliament meeting to talk about expelling u.s. forces. what was soleimani's main goal in iraq? it was to get the americans out, to undermine our influence. so, we seem to have accomplished what soleimani was trying to do but couldn't, so in death he's actually accomplished his goal. that is a -- that turns back u.s. interests in the region.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris wallace: you have been tweeting ever since the soleimani takedown. here's one of them. the constitution makes clear that a president may not go to war without authorization from congress, and we have not authorized war with iran. but, senator, the white house says this is not war, that soleimani was a terrorist, and this was an act of self-defense, which a commander-in-chief can always take.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris van hollen: my point, chris, is we're now headed very close to the precipice of war. you just heard the president this morning talk about targeting iranian sites, including cultural sites, which is, in fact, a war crime if the president was to carry that out. the point we're making is that the president is not entitled under the constitution to continue this escalation and take us to war without congressional action. that's what the constitution requires. look, i heard secretary pompeo talk about this. you asked him about the maximum pressure strategy. they've not accomplished any of their goals. they had very unrealistic goals. all they have done under maximum pressure is escalate the chance of war with iran, something president trump said he wanted to avoid, but a lot of people around him, like secretary pompeo, have been urging a confrontation with iran for a very long time, including when he was a member of congress.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris wallace: i want to pick up on this, because here was another one of your tweets in the last couple of days. the administration's reckless policy over the last three years has brought us to the brink, but the president -- and you just heard secretary pompeo say, no, it was president obama who brought us to the brink; it was the obama nuclear deal which funneled billions of dollars back into the regime that they used to spread their brand of terror across the middle east, and also, it was the obama administration's decision to focus exclusively on the nuclear program and to ignore all the other malign activity by iran throughout the region.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris van hollen: well, first of all, they didn't ignore it, but the obama administration correctly observed that a nuclear-armed iran would be even more dangerous than an iran that did not have nuclear weapons. and so, what this administration did was they ripped up that agreement, essentially divided us from our allies, and the result has been this increased actual activity from iran in the region.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris wallace: well, not necessarily. i mean, you look at the reports that because of the fact that there are economic sanctions and iran is economically strapped, that hezbollah is starved for money, hamas is starved for money. isn't that a good thing?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris van hollen: so, look, there's no doubt that the maximum pressure campaign is putting pressure on iran, but to what end? secretary pompeo had a list of, like, 11 things the iranian regime had to do, and it was never realistic, and that's why they've got no endgame. and that's why we're here right now, after this latest escalation, at much greater risk of going to war with iran, which would be very damaging to the united states. obviously, it would be damaging to iran, but it would be very damaging to the united states.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris van hollen: iran has continued to prosecute its efforts in syria throughout the time of this administration, so the notion that they've succeeded in doing anything to stop iran's malign influence is nonsense. what they have done is dramatically escalate the chance of war.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "michael anton: i don't know that i necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. you could interpret it as justified retaliation for all kinds of things that you've talked about earlier in the program that iran has been doing without much of a response. so the main point i would want to make here is the iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation, and when they finally do get pushback, they tend to back down and go into the turtle mode for a little while and that may yet happen again. we've seen that happen in the past. they haven't faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the iran deal all around the middle east, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they, i think, got overconfident and to some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that soleimani went right into iran and the airport -- sorry, into iraq in the airport completely confident that he owned the place and that nothing would happen to him. so, i think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to maybe make the regime retreat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "chris wallace: josh, i want to move to a different aspect of the questions that people are asking this week. president trump very publicly and has reaffirmed it as recently as this fall that the situation in syria ran on getting the u.s. out of endless wars in the middle east. but as i discussed with secretary pompeo, this week alone he sent more than 4,000 u.s. troops into the region. so, are we getting out? are we getting deeper?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "josh holmes: well, i don't think that's inconsistent at all. i mean, i think his overarching policy as secretary pompeo articulated very clearly is to remove america from these endless wars and these conflicts in syria, the conflicts in iraq and beyond, but that also cannot override immediate security threats. you need to be responsive to that and i will just say, i'm totally stunned at the notion that somehow america is the one that is bringing this to a higher escalation level. the president's critics may not have been paying attention to what's happened over the last couple of years, but just because they're more focused on trying to impeach the president of the united states than the health and well-being of american soldiers in iraq, doesn't mean that things aren't happening. this guy has tried -- has killed over 600 american soldiers, all right? just last week, we watched him storm the embassy in baghdad. now, how america is the aggressor here is beyond me but what they did is for the first time in a long time, and i'll argue that the president has been extremely reluctant to engage in this kind of thing, but first time in a long time tell iran not anymore. you're not going to be attacking american assets or american personnel without severe repercussions and i think that's a great thing for this country.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "mo elleithee: yeah, it's interesting. one of the president's rationales for withdrawing from the iran deal was that by doing so and imposing these crippling economic sanctions on the regime, it would bring the regime to its knees. in fact, the exact opposite has happened. the regime has become more and more emboldened and has done -- has been escalating its rhetoric. look, my concern here is, and as others have said, is what are the ramifications regionally? this was not our first opportunity to go after this guy. stan mcchrystal, who was no -- you know, who was fired by president obama, he was no fan of obama foreign policy.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "josh holmes: well, first off, this whole thing is kind of confusing to me, as to why nancy pelosi believes that it increases her leverage, by holding the papers. i mean, every day that she holds them, they look more and more bizarre. and the closer and closer that they get to the iowa caucuses -- which, of course, throws off the closing arguments for every 2020 democrat running against president trump, ultimately -- but secondly, she has no leverage here. this is not about trying to control the contours of the senate. she's never going to be able to do that. so, this ends only one way; and that's when she sends the papers over without any kind of preconditions. that's basically what mcconnell said this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris wallace: okay. and what about my second question, which is, if you -- you've got 47 democrats. if they were to get four republicans, they'd have 51. they'd have a majority -- assuming they all vote together. and then they could call mick mulvaney. they could call john bolton. what's the prospect of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "josh holmes: yeah. i mean, that's, like, the if and -- ifs and buts, and candy and nuts, [unintelligible] christmas in every day. there's no chance of that happening. let me tell you why -- specifically because what mcconnell was advocating for is an imminently reasonable process, one that was adopted 100 to nothing in the clinton impeachment trial in the 1990s. and what that does is provide the impeachment managers from the house and the president's defense team the opportunity to lay out their cases. and what is agreed to at the front end is that framework. after you get through that framework, then senators are -- after they go through a series of questioning, are able to look at what's missing. and at that point, you can have a discussion about whether you bring in different pieces of evidence, whether you bring --", "augmented": []}

{"original": "josh holmes: no, no. absolutely not, because what it does it create complete chaos. and i've got to tell you: democrats don't want it either because they're a lot closer to getting 51 for hunter biden than they are for anybody in the trump administration.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris wallace: congresswoman edwards, how long can nancy pelosi hang on to these articles of impeachment? i mean, it was the democrats -- it was pelosi, it was schiff -- who said donald trump -- we've got to move forward because he is a clear and present danger. now they are the ones holding up the process to remove him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "donna edwards: well, no. i mean, i think we should examine that where we are right now is precisely because mitch mcconnell openly said that he wasn't going to have a fair process. and i think it's legitimate for speaker pelosi to actually keep open this process as long as she needs to. i mean, she's going to turn over the articles of impeachment, but she does want assurances, given that mcconnell came out straightforwardly and said he wasn't going to have a fair process and that he was coordinating with the president. and so, you know, and i think that she actually has created leverage, because, in fact, she opened up the space for murkowski and collins. and i'm waiting for this phase -- for mitt romney, who stands nothing to gain in this process by aligning himself with the administration, with the president -- to make sure that there is, indeed, a fair process.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chris wallace: all right. we're going to continue. we'll have plenty of time to continue that conversation. let's turn to the democratic presidential campaign, because we just got the fourth quarter, the end of 2019 fundraising numbers for all of the democratic candidates, and they're pretty interesting. put them up on the screen. bernie sanders led the field in the fourth quarter, raising $34.5 million. pete buttigieg, joe biden, and elizabeth warren are closely bunched about $10 million behind, and then it's another $5 million back to andrew yang. mo, how do you handicap the race at this point?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sen. cornyn: well, i think it's entirely likely that his testimony would be helpful to the president, because it would identify basically a foreign policy dispute which is reserved to the president under the constitution, is really his sole authority as a as a basis for impeachment for this. now, the third time in american history. so he could. it could well be beneficial. and as to the second count, which is obstruction, you'll recall that the adam schiff did say he was wanted to subpoena ambassador bolton. but when ambassador bolton said he wanted a court to instruct him whether to comply with the subpoena or whether to invoke executive privilege, as the white house had insisted that he'd look to the court for guidance and adam schiff dropped it like a hot potato. so i don't know how this would come out the way i read the ambassador's offer. he didn't say what he was testimony would be, but he would respond to the subpoena. and i would expect anyone who was subpoenaed by the vote of 51 senators to respond. but what their testimony actually turns out to be, that's another matter.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sen. cornyn: well, i'm i am a little surprised because i agree with you. i think ordinarily speaker pelosi is a pretty shrewd political tactician. but i think here she got forced to do something she did not want to do in the first place, which was to proceed with the impeachment. you may recall her comments back in march of 2019, where she said only if it was bipartisan and the case compelling would it be worn. the divisiveness that would necessarily arise out of an impeachment proceeding. and then she proceeded after that. months after that to basically cave in to the demands of the most radical members of her own party. i think that's what happened here. and now she's finds herself in a a bit of a box canyon. and it's not clear exactly how she gets out of this unless, of course, senator mcconnell succumbs, which i know he will not do to the entreaties of senator schumer to recreate the circus like atmosphere in the house, in the senate. we're not going to do that. we will take it seriously. we will perform our constitutional responsibilities. but i think this is a box that. speaker pelosi has gotten herself in, and it's going to be fascinating to see how she gets out of it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sen. cornyn: yeah, well, you would think that that senate democrats who negotiated a procedural arrangement for the president clinton impeachment, that they would be satisfied with that same arrangement being used in the impeachment trial of president trump. but they're not. and they're asking for more. as we've discussed and i think they know how this ends, because it's going to take 67 votes to convict and remove president trump. and they're doing all of this less than a year, about 11 months until the next general election. i think it's it's really backfiring on them. they know it is. and they're they're desperate to try to find a way out. but so far, they haven't figured it out.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sen. cornyn: well, i i i wonder whether senator schumer thinks that bernie sanders or elizabeth warren or joe biden i guess he is no longer in the senate. amy klobuchar and other senators running for president are, strictly speaking, impartial writers. it's not a good it's not a good analogy. i know all of us, including myself, have used that as an analogy, but it's not the same thing as an impartial jury in a criminal or civil case that would be tried in a court of law. we know that the that this is primarily a political matter and one where the people who cast their vote, either in the house from the senate will be held accountable by the people they represent. that's what this is. so i think it's it's hypocritical, particularly if looking back on the way that senator schumer and others conducted themselves in the clinton impeachment, he actually ran for the senate against senator al d'amato, saying if elected, he would vote to acquit president clinton. that's not exactly impartial.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sen. cornyn: well, the world is a better place for for this. and certainly while we don't know what iran's response is going to be, i think president trump acted within his authority to defend the united states, our troops and our interests in the middle east against somebody who has american blood on his hands and who's been known to be part of a designated terrorist organization, the islamic revolutionary guard and particularly the kurds force that has is well-known throughout the middle east, providing things like explosively formed penetrators, which would cut through the armor of american soldiers in afghanistan and iraq like a knife through a hot knife, through butter. so nobody should mourn the demise of general soleimani and the president did operate within his constitutional authority. i think what we've just been discussing and the disarray of the house over this impeachment matter shows the wisdom of the founding fathers giving these sort of decisions under the constitution to the commander in chief and not 535 members of congress. i think the contrast between the way that the death of osama bin laden was greeted on a bipartisan basis in the way now that soleimani death is being greeted on a partisan basis, is tells tells the story.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sen. cornyn: well, i think it's irresponsible and i think it defies reality. i mean, the truth is it's the democrats who are trying to change the subject and trying to create a further circus like atmosphere here in the senate because of their lack of success in dealing with this impeachment matter in the house. this is obviously a totally separate matter. i respect people what democrats like joe lieberman and jay johnson, who both said in recent days that this is well within the president's authority and a necessary act. and i also respect great leaders like ryan crocker, who today i think is in the new york times, wrote a piece about why this was within the president's authority, why it was necessary. and it was a former cia director and centcom commander, david petraeus, who made the point that this is more significant in terms of our fight against radical islam than was the death of osama bin laden. so this was a a very big deal. and i think the president is to be commended for his decisive action in the face of a real threat.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "number one, don't be fooled by the line-up. all the players will not be on the field thursday. first here's a list of the candidates who will be suiting up and appearing on the field: tim pawlenty, ron paul, rick santorum, herman cain and gary johnson.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one unique aspect of this debate is that for millions of americans, even the most ardent republicans, it will be the first time they have seen or heard these candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "pawlenty will be the most plausible candidate for the nomination on stage thrusday night. the former minnesota governor's calm and reasoned demeanor will set him apart from the far-right firebrands who will be on stage. his biggest challenge will be to resist the temptation to be pulled too far to the right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "santorum, paul and cain will undoubtedly be throwing rhetorical red meat to the south carolina audience. pawlenty has never shown the ability to compete with any of them as a performer and a showman. his strength is a good record of conservative policies from his tenure as governor of minnesota. if he simply gives direct answers to the questions and does not get drawn into the contest for who can be the most outrageous conservative provocateur, it might be enough to make him a winner.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for the other four candidates on the stage the big debate is their best chance so far to make a winning impression on gop voters. one of them could have a very big night and become the leader of the pack.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "gop primary voters tend to be more conservative just as democratic primary voters tend to be more liberal. rick santorum, herman cain, ron paul, gary johnson and buddy roemer are generally far to the right and wildcards. their unabashed rhetoric might spark an internet sensation and appeal to the voters who are want a gop nominee who is the antithesis of politics as usual.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but will the lesser-known candidates know how to handle foreign policy questions? can they demonstrate knowledge of economic issues? send in those questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, here's a list of candidates who will not be appearing on thursday night: michelle bachmann, mitch daniels, newt gingrich, mike huckabee, mitt romney, donald trump and sarah palin all will not be attending. bachmann, gingrich and romney have been clear about their interest in pursuing the nomination. daniels, huckabee, palin and trump have been clearly hesitant to officially jump into the fray.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's my belief that romney, the biggest star in the group, is not coming because he wants the republican faithful, especially people with big money, to come to him out of frustration with a mediocre field and give him the nomination by acclamation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but he knows that if he shows up he'll be targeted by all the other candidates who want to bring down the biggest player. and he will have to endure question after question from the fox team and his opponents about creating a universal health care plan in massachusetts that closely mirrors the president's controversial health care reform plan. so his strategy is to let the little guys fight it out before they get to challenge him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if gingrich showed up he will have to answer questions from all sides about his flip-flops on u.s. intervention in libya.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "kerik: you know what, tucker? nobody knows how to fix the city and how to reduce crime better than i did, and i do because i was there when the renaissance occurred, but it looks like this mayor and this governor, they're trying to diminish and destroy all the programs that were put in place that reduced crime by 65 -- violent crime by 65 to 70 percent, homicide by 70 to 75 percent.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and what they did in this -- with these new laws where they're letting people back out on the street, it's going to diminish quality of life and it's going to enhance violence.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "for about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class. eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging. they're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, over policed neighborhoods, whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden republicans who have forgotten who they represent. the year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "carlson: so i don't think there is any topic on which there is a greater divide between what the majority of citizens of all parties, all colors say they want and what they get from the people in charge. why is this complicated for our leaders?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mac donald: because they're in the grips of a false narrative, which says that the criminal justice system is racist. this massive wave of de- incarceration, decriminalization that is going on across the country as you point out, tucker, is being done in the name of racial justice.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "carlson: i can't resist pointing out that at the very moment when we're literally letting arsonists go free, roger stone is facing life in prison for what? it's not even clear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so the political penalties have gotten stiffer, but the penalties for violence and mayhem have almost disappeared in a lot of cases. but again, there's no constituency for this outside of like small pockets of affluence on the coast, like normal people are not for this. they never have been for it. so how do our leaders get away with it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mac donald: well, the activists are for it, the academia is for it. again, the universities are the source of this narrative that says that everything about america today is defined and created by racism. and i guess, the public does not have a voice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but we if we get a rise in crime, like we did in the 90s, it is going to swing back again. right now, we are living off of the law enforcement reforms that said policing matters, that incarceration matters, and we've gotten lazy, and the elites are back in the saddle, you know, and it's going to take a lot of thousands of more black lives lost to criminals who should be in jail before this gets turned around.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: let me ask a quick question. so when bernie sanders or someone like him stands up and says, the only reason these people are in jail is because they're poor, just like demonstrably false.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i've never heard a republican candidate or any republican officeholders say, you know, that's just a flat out lie actually. we have the numbers, you're wrong. why do they never stand up for simple law and order?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mac donald: they're scared. i mean, they're absolutely terrified of the racism charge. i was at a house judiciary committee hearing that talked about the criminal justice system. i was very disappointed in the republicans. they just spouted bromides about our men and women in blue without actually combating the lie that the criminal justice system is racist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as for this idea that cash bail affects the poor. listen, in new york city, only seven percent of misdemeanor arrestees have any kind of bail set for them. and that's because they have long felony arrest records and only", "augmented": []}
{"original": "0.6 percent of misdemeanor arrests, these are actually in jail.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "carlson: so there was that and he won a vote or two with that unusual argument. his other argument was that voters should vote for him based on his identity. the video announcing the end of his candidacy opened and closed with a line in spanish, which basically said it all, vote for me because of my background and because i speak spanish.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so instead, he had to play up his views on immigration, which honestly, were kind of extreme. watch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "castro: instead of building a wall or closing the border, we should choose compassion instead of cruelty.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "alisyn camerota, cnn anchor: the feeling from this administration is that we are in a full-blown crisis and that they are overwhelmed by it. how do you think?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "castro: you know, i don't believe their narrative. i don't believe the bs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we should decriminalize people who are coming here, crossing the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we need to increase the number of refugees that we take into this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and if we're not careful, if we don't get this right, in 20 or 30 years, this nation is going to be begging for immigrants to come to this country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: begging -- and if you're not, you're not grateful. you're a bad person.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, as we said, he is out of the race and over on msnbc, they're taking it hard. some of the anchors pointed to castro's departure. it's just the latest evidence that the democratic primary electorate is racist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unidentified female: julian castro, the only thing latino running ends his campaign today leaving the democrats even less diverse. following the earlier departure, of course of senator kamala harris.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "as of now, there are going to be five white candidates on this next debate stage. is that sustainable for the democratic party?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: david perino is the first person we go to, to figure out what's going on in this race. she hosts the daily briefing, of course with dana perino. we're always grateful to have her.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so dana, you keep hearing from democrats, this grave disappointment in their own primary electorate suggesting that they're bigots for supporting, i guess, biden and bernie, what do you make of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dana perino, fox news host: and then i wonder if the media organizations are going to send out a bunch of reporters all across the nation to find out what actually is happening in this country as they did after the 2016 election results.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the thing about julio castro is that he gave the d.n.c. convention speech back in 2012 and he became the candidate of tomorrow, but he was a candidate of tomorrow for so long that it became yesterday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he never was able to get a foothold. and the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if you think of someone like elizabeth warren and medicare-for-all, that got the full treatment, but julian castro, ever since 2012 thought that he was going to be on that stage, maybe the nominee? i think that he will, though, be on the vp shortlist, even if he really doesn't deserve to be, but his name will be on the list.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i don't know if they'll actually choose him because there's many other people that show that they were able to get some base of support.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: you make such a smart point. i mean, if i get up and said, you know, if a biological man gets pregnant, i promise i'll pay for his abortion. i'd be laughed at and i'd probably lose my job, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but he was so ignored that he could say that and people were like, oh, yeah, okay. you know, whatever. i just want to ask you --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perino: that's when you know you're in real trouble. if you say something like that and like -- it's like if a tree falls in a forest, like if you say something like that on a debate stage and everyone goes, yes, well, it's just like helium. okay.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: yes, you could just be floridly and say that and nobody cares.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so this happened in new hampshire on monday. joe biden explained how coal miners should adapt to having their jobs regulated out of existence. they should just learn a completely different profession from scratch. watch.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "joe biden, d-presidential candidate: i come from a family -- we're in an area where there is coal mining in scranton. anybody who could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mine sure in hell can learn how to program as well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: so this just -- this struck me as so very similar to a line that we heard not very long ago, basically dismissing the concerns of people whose industries, particularly the coal business has been regulated out of existence. is that a wise thing even for a democrats to say right now?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perino: so you're saying i think you're talking about the hillary clinton comment in the 2016 campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perino: in which basically she was like celebrating the fact that they were going to try to put coal out of business, and then she had the deplorables line and she never really came back from that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think the thing about joe biden is that a lot of people will give him the benefit of the doubt and they will think, well, joe means well. okay, like, he doesn't really -- he doesn't want us to be without jobs. he cares about us -- like, he has that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there is an elitist attitude about coal that it belies the entire democratic party. the truth is, if he wants to win, he is going to have to try to win back some of those workers ion the rust belt, including coal workers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perino: and i think that what he could have done, since apparently america is in a mood to wildly spend on government programs, why not try to ratchet it up and i would -- he could have said something like, i'm going to commit", "augmented": []}
{"original": "$15 billion for this community, specifically to help them, make sure that they're taken care of et cetera.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, one thing that happened last week, the taxpayers are going to bail out a lot of the coal pensions because they were mismanaged by the executives, not the workers, but by the executives and guess then who gets on the hook for that? the taxpayers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and joe biden doesn't do any of that. he bypasses it and says something they could learn to code, which i think will come back to haunt him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: so i just wonder quickly, i mean, that kind of tells you a lot about how that community is viewed in the democratic party. i mean, is it that hard if you're promising, you know, everybody a chunk of cash, just to say that, you know, kentucky, southwest virginia and west virginia, here's some -- but they can't because they don't like those people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perino: i think that it's showing that you have some -- i mean, think about bill clinton, right? i feel your pain. he didn't really, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "perino: but people thought that he meant it when he said that. joe biden has the capability to be that kind of guy as well. but what he said the other night was much more in line with sort of the fundraising circuit for democrats, not the people circuit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: yes. mistake. dana perino, great to see you tonight. thank you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: happy new year. so you were celebrating this past week with your family, but permanent washington was plotting yet another war in the middle east.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tonight, there seems to have been another big step toward that war. we will be asking a question nobody seems to be raising. is it a good idea?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "an update and what's happening tonight after the break.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: we have an unexpected fox news alert for you, something that has just happened in iraq. the situation there, heating up very quickly without any debate here in washington.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "iraqi television has just confirmed that qasem soleimani, a former general in iran's revolutionary guard and the commander of the quds force has been killed in a rocket attack apparently initiated by the united states near the baghdad airport, along with the top official in the iraqi shiite militia. now, what were they doing in iraq? unclear.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but his death comes several days after tensions kind of came out into the open in that country. last week, if you've been following this, you know, an american civilian contractor was killed by militants in iraq. the u.s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "government blamed that attack on iran and it retaliated with strikes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in response, protesters blockaded the u.s. embassy in baghdad. it's basically where we were when the show started tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "defense secretary mark esper warned that the united states is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but america appears to be lumbering toward a new middle east war. and we have to say it's one that official washington has wanted for decades.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "for example, disgraced national security adviser, john bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with iran and tonight, bolton may be finally getting his wish. should you be happy about that? that's the question.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, the last time we took john bolton's advice in the region, iran became far more powerful than it was before, before we took john bolton's advice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "why? because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in washington.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in this case, the very people demanding action against iran tonight, the ones telling you the persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of america now in progress from the south. the millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us. the real threat is iran. well, they're liars. and they don't care about you. they don't care about your kids. they are reckless and incompetent. and you should keep all of that in mind, as war with iran looms closer tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "curt mills is a senior writer at the american conservative. he joins us now. so curt, this is unfolding, even as we speak. where could it go from here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "curt mills, senior writer, american conservative: well, like you said, if you liked the iraq war, tucker, we're back with a sequel, the iran war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i would say the deep concern is, look, a general in the iranian forces being assassinated is not necessarily something to mourn or begrudge the u.s. getting involved in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mills: the question is, though, is this a franz ferdinand moment? is this a situation where a great power gets involved with the middle tier power and gets the world into a world war?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "iran, i think is a problem for the u.s. and its allies in the region. but it is not an existential threat, like china or russia. china or russia, particularly china would love to see another decade or two of americans my age, dying in the sand for no particular purpose.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: well, that's exactly it. it's not that anyone i think in the united states has particular affection for iran or trust in its government, much, much less the revolutionary guard or the kurds forces. of course not.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in washington describes the threat that i think makes sensible people nervous, that iran is the greatest threat we face. i mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mills: it's a joke. it's a joke. i mean, i think the real question is, why do we still have troops there? so you see the baghdad embassy protests. and to be clear, this is not just an embassy. this is a fortress. it's been a fortress since we took out saddam in 2003 and american troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they're just -- they're sent there. so the question the president, who i think rightfully ran in 2016, against the bush legacy. the question is, does he want to re-invade iraq?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i understand there are people in his cabinet that are selling him that iran is not iraq? but the fact of the matter, iran is quite similar to iraq.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're talking about iraq, 16 years later, it's still iraq.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in order to counter iran, i think the choice is clear. the president should contain iranian influence in the region. we should avoid a hot war, which we are barreling towards at all costs.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: so my sense of it is, the president doesn't seek war and he is wary of it, particularly in an election year, but i think he was elected on the promise that he would avoid wars except when absolutely necessary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the president wants.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mills: right. so i think the president of the united states' convictions on this matter are sincere, but i think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i know, bolton is a bugbear for you. but in some ways, bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious. he actually was a bit of a problem for the iran hawk crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like robert c. o'brien, bolton's successor might actually be more effective at trojan horsing, what i think would be a tragedy in the middle east.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "iran is not iraq, it's twice as big. it'd be twice as bad. we're weaker than we were 16 years ago. if president george w. bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if trump does, he is cooked.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: i think that's right. curt mills. great to see you tonight. thank you for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mills: thanks. so you hear a lot from the left about how concerned about the environment they are. but you've noticed that those concerns have always conveniently dovetailed with acquiring more political power and crushing their political enemies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "california saw major wildfires this year and according to the nation magazine, there's a clear culprit -- private homeownership is the problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and we're quoting now, the idealization of individual homeownership created the scorching landscapes we face today. individual homeownership should be seriously questioned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "banning private homeownership? will that stop wildfires? it would fix the environment. how about building fewer shopping malls? no one ever thinks of that. no, it won't. it will make the government more powerful. it'll make regular people less happy and less free. and of course, that is the point.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "victor davis hanson is a lifelong californian. he is a fellow at the hoover institution and we're happy to have him tonight. professor, thanks a lot for coming on. do you think that wildfires besetting your state mean that people should not be allowed to own their own homes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "victor davis hanson, fellow, hoover institution: well, it's a characteristic of the left that they envision natural and man-made disasters as opportunities to ram down agendas that we otherwise wouldn't vote for, and that's what rahm emanuel said, never let a crisis go to waste.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think it was aoc's chief of staff who said the new green deal was really not about climate change, but changing the american economy along socialist lines. this had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, tucker.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we've only gone up about one degree in a century in california. that's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed. what it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, pg&e which was at one time as you remember as a californian, the best utility in the united states. it's ossified. it's calcified. it's over regulated. it's got all these green mandates. it's got to use expensive energy production.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when i was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and then finally, i think this is really important that california zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the bay area, or la. so people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in california.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and when you have infrastructure -- infrastructure that is rated about the worst in the nation, our highways and bridges, and it's hard to get to these places. the freeways are packed. we haven't built a major reservoir since new melones dam in 1983. so it's a kind of a perfect storm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and you know, tucker when state and local officials can't solve existential problems, they blame other reasons and when they can't deal with homelessness and then you banned plastic bottles at san francisco airport.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we can't deal with utility or wildfire damage, then you say climate change did it and we've got to become socialists.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: well, i mean, it's dysfunctional because it's crowded, and it's crowded because of their immigration policy and they won't admit that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they did this, as you know. professor, thank you so much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: so attacking homeowners is just one facet of the broader assault on normal people in this country. in the city of san francisco, progressives are working constantly to create their ideal vision of an american city.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the opposite has been the effect. it is now unsafe, unhealthy, unaffordable, and for many, unlivable. it's a dystopia in a lot of ways.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the most beautiful city in our country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we sent a team of producers to san francisco for an in-depth exclusive investigation into what is happening there. and the effect it is having on the dwindling pool of middle class residents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "our special series debuts next monday, and it continues all week. here's a short preview of what we found.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: oh, it's -- even the trailer is all too much. it's shocking what we found.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, up next, free speech may be dying in parts of america, but adam carolla and dennis prager are ensuring the first amendment would at least go down fighting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "their documentary is back in theaters and they join us next to talk about it. stay tuned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: freedom of speech is america's most distinctive, right. it's a free country. remember they used to say that back when it was. but it's also the most embattled of all of our rights.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in the name of safety and sensitivity, a coalition of big tech monopolists, universities and political activists are fighting to limit what you're allowed to say, and punish those who stray outside the accepted boundaries.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but last year, comedian adam carolla who is a genius, and radio host, dennis prager, also kind of genius, teamed up to release no safe spaces,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kind of a brilliant documentary about the american anti-speech movement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "dennis prager, founder, prager u: israel sent me into the soviet union when i was 21 years old, because i knew russian and hebrew, and i was sent in to smuggle out the names of jews that i would find in the soviet union and to smuggle in religious items and so on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i really experienced what most people in the west have never ever experienced -- life under a totalitarian regime.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: it's a great movie. and if you want to see it in theaters, you still have a chance to do that. the film is having a limited release this weekend, thanks to strong support from grateful viewers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "adam carolla and dennis prager, join us tonight. gentlemen, thanks both for coming out. i haven't talked to you since the film came out. just to start with you, adam. what was the risk? did anyone tell you that you're not allowed to say the things you said in the film? did the irony loop come complete?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "adam carolla, comedian: it is interesting when people are talking about free speech, but it's free speech that they want to vet and make sure it's okay for them to hear before you can say it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "prager: yes. this resentment is a very big problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: well, i think he may be close to one of my producers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: the problem is -- it's a big problem. we enjoy each other too much. we're looking for problems.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: yes. we're still kind of in the newly wed phase of our relationship.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: so what are -- but even newlyweds, they may sublimate it, but there's usually tension. if you could identify one thing that divides you bitterly, what would it be?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "prager: your cat liked it. i asked you specifically how it went over in the corolla home. you said the cat loved it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: yes, he gave me a jar of gefilte fish.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: by the way fish isn't supposed to be in jars. just for your information. it should be on platters or it's supposed to be above a fireplace in a hunting lodge. your aquarium. that's right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: by the way, this was the danger working with him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: so has the problem gotten better?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: the gefilte fish is as bad as it has ever been.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: no, that's -- i mean, i think that's there's not any room for improvement there at all. but the question of speech, do you think the country has become freer or less free in the last year?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: no, it's -- it is less free. there's no question. and you could -- there's an interesting proof. read the reviewers in the mainstream media, not to mention left wing media, on how they have contempt for the film.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "when the film features liberal after liberal, including president obama, speaking about what's going on, on campuses, but they can't even acknowledge that this is going on when they see the film, which is about the suppression of speech.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: i have a slightly different feeling on it. yes, well, here's what i think. i feel like the pendulum is starting to swing back the other direction.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i mean, the comedic community and i feel a lot of my cohorts in the comedy world are starting to push back against it because they're at their saturation level. and i feel like the group that started this thing is starting to double down on it, starting to really work it harder.'", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's sort of the same subject is racism. as racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: i think he is right about the comedic community. that's correct. outside of that, i don't think it's true. san francisco 49'er color announcer -- and i'm not sure you could use that term any longer -- simply said in describing the baltimore ravens quarterback who is a terrific quarterback and who is black and he said, you know, there might be the slight half second advantage in a handoff because the ball is black and the uniform is black and he is black. so the offensive line doesn't see it quite as quickly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the guy was said, you're a racist. and unless he apologized profusely as in mao's china in the cultural revolution, he would have lost his job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: defensive line, but we know what you're talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: so i wonder if we are at the point though where --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: that's right, defensive line. you are right and that was a boo- boo.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: i wonder if it's counterproductive -- okay, but the point remains, is it -- i mean, what about the people who are facing this problem and there are a lot of them, not just famous people, but normal people who are under attack by the hr department down the hall. what's the right response for them? should they go through the mao's china routine where they apologize and beg forgiveness? or do they stand on principle?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: well, i won't -- i don't know what adam's position is on this. but i think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong. i don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it's so humiliating that i personally couldn't do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: well, i think we're going to have to do it this way because i do my own podcast. i have my own pirate ship. i have autonomy. i can say what i want. i don't have to apologize. and thus, i'm not asked to apologize because i never apologize.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but for guys who do announcers for the 49'ers, what are they to do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: no, i know. it's a horrible, horrible dilemma.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carolla: what we have to do is all stop apologizing at the same time. i mean, if there's one guy with a gun, we just have pool cues and we all need to charge them at once. if we do it one by one, we'll be taken out one by one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "prager: by the way, just let me remind people, because it's a great film.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "even with those relatively permissive standards, 35 people is a huge field. it is a result of not only a pretty considerable amount of talent on the democratic bench but also the fact that the democrats believe president trump is eminently beatable in 2020.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "we don't know what an obama democrat really is since his rise was a singular phenomenon rather than a movement. it may be only now, without the presence of his longtime rival, hillary clinton, that the democrats get down to defining what that means.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "conventional wisdom holds that republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. yes, george w. bush and ronald reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. of the 15 democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, franklin roosevelt and woodrow wilson, were former governors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "maybe it was just because republicans nominated thomas dewey so often that it seemed like more…", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that being said, any of the governors on this list would have to win as dark horse candidates. hickenlooper, a moderate and successful businessman, has been nosing around a run longer than the rest, but is still a relative unknown inside his party.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it's crazy to think that 11 sitting senators will all compete for the democratic nomination, and that's because it's not going to happen. you sometimes get the sense with senators that they say they're interested because it would be too embarrassing to say otherwise. if everybody else has an exploratory committee, why not you?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even so, there will be at least four serious contenders in the senate that will make life much harder for sen. chuck schumer as he tries to overcome his members' personal ambition for the good of the party overall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it seems pretty clear that 2016 runner-up sanders will be plowing the same ground as warren who is doing her best to simulate gusto in her now-official candidacy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so it seems for harris and booker, as well. the two of them were already jousting during the televised spectacle of the most recent supreme court confirmation hearings, trying to be the most woke and most brutal in their performances. harris got the better of booker then and, we expect, will be in good position to do so again.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "she is particularly helped by the emergence of her home state as an early primary. california democrats will go to the polls on march 3rd as opposed to june, their traditional primary month. that puts the largest trove of democratic delegates up for grabs four weeks after the iowa caucuses. if you can't play in california this time around, you can't play at all.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that conundrum will confront democratic kingmakers again and again as they try to whittle down this massive field. if trump, who had no experience in public service, can win why not someone with a lengthy background even if it's not on a national level?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bloomberg seems to be the only one who can make an argument for top-tier status thanks to his famous name, ability to fund his own campaign and track record as an advocate for gun control. as a party switcher and mega-rich white dude he will have a long way to go to answer concerns from democratic loyalists, but if he's serious about running after a decade of false starts, he could be a contender.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hedge fund manager tom steyer - former starbucks ceo howard schultz", "augmented": []}

{"original": "while schultz's efforts so far have looked more like an identity crisis than a real candidacy, steyer is a serious player. he spent much of the past two years generating a list of potential supporters through an impeachment petition he lavishly advertised on television. he also established credibility with liberal activists by funding insurgent candidates like andrew gillum in florida.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "steyer's longstanding efforts on climate change help, too. whether that's enough to overcome democratic aversion to nominating a white, episcopalian hedge fund manager we don't know.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "section 230 of the communications decency act of 1996 states that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. the section has been pivotal in the rise of today's social media giants by allowing not only internet service providers –­ but also google, twitter, facebook, youtube and others –­ to be shielded from liability from content posted on their platforms by third parties, in most cases.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "critics have long felt the tech giants should no longer benefit from the protections of section 230 and toscano thinks the decisio to de-platform trump is clear evidence changes need to be made.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think now we have proof that twitter, facebook, youtube, all these companies in making this move, feel that they are responsible for the content on their platform, which then drives the conversation into section 230, toscano said. that's the whole argument of section 230, right? they all argue that they shouldn't be held accountable for the content on their platform. well, they just made a huge statement that they do feel accountable.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i think that section 230 has needed to be changed for quite some time, i think it's not appropriate for the current state of the internet. back in the 1990s when it was put into place, it was written that way to enable innovation, which it did, toscano said. i think we've just reached the point… no one is accountable and now it's time for us to change some of those rules in order to make sure people are held accountable.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "president trump gave both kosovo and serbia a clear path towards getting greater u.s. support, a u.s. official told fox news. he wants them to come up with a mutually agreed upon solution. as long as they both agree, then he will support it. unlike the european position, everything is on the table for the u.s.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "uneasy relations between serbia and its former province have simmered since kosovo declared independence in 2008, nine years after a nato-led military campaign led drove the serbs from kosovo. the nato action came after a serbian ethnic cleansing campaign drove hundreds of thousands of kosovars to neighboring countries, and threatened to engulf the states of the foreign yugoslavia into war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "thaci's meeting with grenell, who as a former spokesperson for the u.s. delegation to the u.n. and foreign policy expert is intimately familiar with the kosovo-serb situation, helped raise the profile of the issue. grennell is regarded a trump confidante in europe who has very effective access to the white house.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in a statement to the post, grenell said he and thaci spoke about the importance of making long-term decisions instead of reacting in the short term. i was pleased that he agreed, and committed to work to end the tariffs that were recently imposed on serbian products, grenell said in a statement to the post. this move would help send the right signals that he is serious about negotiating and help build trust between the parties.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "one u.s. attribute that distinguishes the current middle east conflict from past ones is the country's energy independence. last september, u.s. petroleum product exports exceeded imports for the first time in recorded history. the energy information agency expects net exports of total crude oil and petroleum to average 570,000 barrels per day in 2020. energy independence means that the u.s. has no vital economic interests in the middle east -- a marked change from past conflicts where the country was dependent on a steady flow of mideast oil to lubricate the domestic economy. this energy security gives the trump administration more leeway in its foreign policy approach. we are independent, and we do not need middle east oil, said president trump in remarks to the nation on wednesday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the 2020 oil risk nobody is talking about consider: in the aftermath of the u.s. killing of iranian general qassem soleimani, the price of oil has only increased by a few percent. contrast this to past conflicts such as the iraq wars and the arab oil embargo of 1973, when the oil price skyrocketed. turmoil in the middle east no longer threatens the u.s. energy supply. the u.s. now produces and consumes about 20 million barrels of petroleum products a day. crude oil production has more than doubled over the last decade as the american fracking revolution and good government policy have combined to create countless gushers. the u.s. is now the world's biggest oil producer. net petroleum imports have fallen from 10 million barrels a day in 2010 -- about 50 percent of consumption -- to zero.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "israel begins pumping from lucrative mediterranean gas field lower oil prices cause lower gas prices, which put more money in the pockets of families and consumers. according to economist stephen moore, a job creators network board member, every one-cent drop in gas prices puts more than $1 billion a year into the hands of americans. with gas prices down around $1 to $1.50 since the fracking revolution, americans have enjoyed the equivalent of a $100 to $150 billion a year economic stimulus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "americans also benefit from lower energy costs beyond just the price of gas. economists suggest that for energy to be considered affordable, it must cost less than six percent of household income. lower energy costs mean less energy poverty for americans on fixed incomes. contrast this energy wealth to the situation in other industrialized nations such as great britain, where thousands of pensioners die each winter because they cannot afford to adequately heat their homes. oil is an input cost on all goods, whether it is used directly in the production process as in the case of plastics or indirectly through transport costs such as with florida oranges. lower costs of basic goods help keep inflation low which disproportionately benefits price-sensitive shoppers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "get fox business on the go by clicking here lower energy costs are a major boon for small businesses, which use far more energy than ordinary families. high energy costs act as a tax on operations, reducing the available income to hire, raise wages, and expand. especially for energy-intensive businesses such as manufacturers, low u.s. energy prices offer a competitive advantage over foreign competitors. unfortunately, democratic presidential candidates want to raise the cost of energy for ordinary americans and small businesses by passing new regulations and taxes on traditional uses. for instance, every candidate wants to ban or severely curtail fracking. this would return the country to a position of economic dependence on middle eastern nations.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "posted may not have been his worst, certainly he has done worse things on", "augmented": []}
{"original": "twitter. they were, i think, probably the last straw.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the most interesting part of twitter's statement, actually, i think,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "was the last statement, how they have information both from their platform", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and from other sources that donald trump was encouraging violence around", "augmented": []}

{"original": "disagreed with the case that was made.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i thought the interesting part of your interview with representative", "augmented": []}
{"original": "clyburn was his suggestion that they would move to impeach in the house and", "augmented": []}
{"original": "then hold the paperwork, essentially not giving it over to the senate,", "augmented": []}

{"original": "you saw a memo over the weekend saying that they wouldn't move until the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "19th, that they couldn't move until the 19th. if the papers were delivered", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at that point, it would be literally right on top of the biden", "augmented": []}
{"original": "inauguration. clearly democrats don't want to do that. and so the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "suggestion that clyburn made there was that they would hold it for a period", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, once it gets to the senate, that's chuck schumer's senate. obviously", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's the new majority leader at that point and they're going to have to", "augmented": []}
{"original": "proceed with a case and a trial. the senate doesn't convict without hearing", "augmented": []}

{"original": "democratic leaders is whether they want the first hundred days to be mired", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in an impeachment trial about his predecessor, which, you know, it clearly", "augmented": []}
{"original": "would have an impact on everything that -- from his legislative agenda to", "augmented": []}

{"original": "where the nominations and confirmations. he can clearly go through a", "augmented": []}
{"original": "democratic majority and work through those pretty quickly. but he's going", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to need a substantial bipartisan effort to get any sort of legislation", "augmented": []}
{"original": "across the finish line because of that 60 vote threshold. they do not have", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what do you get the sense he's going to push first? what do you think he'll", "augmented": []}
{"original": "put off until later in the year? and given the fact that, you know, it's", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now just a few votes in the house and one vote in the senate, do you think", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's some parts of the agenda that he campaigned on that are just going", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to go on the back burner?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "harf: well, chris, i think, number one has to be getting his team in place.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that involves dealing with everything from covid to the economy and", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jobs to national security. and so i do think that there's a strong sense", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that confirmations have to happen immediately. and then paired with that is", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the question of additional covid relief for americans. he has talked about", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the $2,000 checks, getting more relief to small businesses, getting", "augmented": []}
{"original": "unemployment relief to people. i think that will be a first priority as", "augmented": []}
{"original": "obviously, the vaccination program isn't really legislative. i think", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they'll probably be more focused on that through executive action and the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i actually think that this is an opportunity for senators like joe", "augmented": []}
{"original": "manchin, chris coons, mitt romney, lisa murkowski, the folks clustered", "augmented": []}
{"original": "around the middle of both parties, to come together to help biden get", "augmented": []}
{"original": "things passed like infrastructure for example, things passed like tweaks to", "augmented": []}
{"original": "our health care system. you know, joe biden did not campaign on huge,", "augmented": []}
{"original": "radical change, he campaigned on working across the aisle to address things", "augmented": []}
{"original": "like prescription drugs. and so i think that once we get through this", "augmented": []}
{"original": "initial period of time where he gets his team in place and works to really", "augmented": []}
{"original": "attack the coronavirus issue, those are the kinds of things he's going to", "augmented": []}

{"original": "politics and that he still has a base that will follow and support him?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "swan: well, he does have a base that will follow and support him. it will", "augmented": []}
{"original": "be the height of naivety to think that he doesn't. and, in fact, i think", "augmented": []}

{"original": "diminished figure after this. yes, he's a -- of course he's a -- he --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there's no doubt he's lost some -- and josh probably has a better read on", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this than i do, some number of republicans. he's certainly lost quite a few", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i don't -- i haven't seen any evidence yet that he's lost a huge", "augmented": []}
{"original": "proportion of the republican base who, you have to remember, was -- and we", "augmented": []}
{"original": "know this both from data, like hard, quantitative data, but also from focus", "augmented": []}
{"original": "groups and from anecdote and from activists in the field, that he had an", "augmented": []}
{"original": "incredible bond with the republican base. a very intense bond that i've", "augmented": []}
{"original": "seen firsthand at many trump rallies and there are some things -- i'm not", "augmented": []}
{"original": "convinced that goes away at all.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "holmes: well, i mean, chris, there's been a seismic change this week and i", "augmented": []}
{"original": "think it's a combination of factors, obviously ending with what happened on", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wednesday. but there was a fatigue everything post-election of the", "augmented": []}
{"original": "president focusing entirely on this, you know, fraudulent election message", "augmented": []}

{"original": "historically, walls were used to keep invaders out. the early chinese states built what has become known as the great wall to protect themselves against the nomadic groups of the steppes. roman emperor hadrian constructed a wall across the british isle separating the roman domain from troublesome northern tribes. more recently, israel has employed several walls—along the west bank and gaza, as well as along its northern and southern borders, to protect itself from terrorism, smuggling, illegal immigration and other threats.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "authoritarian regimes have used walls to keep their populations in. during the cold war, the communist german democratic republic constructed the berlin wall to separate east berlin from west berlin at least as much to keep their own residents in as their western foes out. the same may be true of the barriers along the demilitarized zone on the korean peninsula, which, in addition to its military function, serves to keep north koreans from defecting.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "click here for more on this topic in fox news opinion", "augmented": []}
{"original": "more recently, walls have been used to keep warring populations separated. walls have long been a staple of counterinsurgency. during the troubles in northern ireland, the british emplaced the so-called peace walls in belfast to separate republican catholic neighborhoods from loyalist protestant ones in an effort to tamp down sectarian violence. similarly, during the iraq war, the united states military relied extensively on giant concrete barrier walls both to combat the improvised explosive device threat and later to help isolate sectarian hot spots, making concrete barriers one of the unsung heroes of the so-called surge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "no matter their original purpose, some basic principles behind walls remain timeless. walls do work, at least for a time. there is a reason, after all, why states across the centuries have turned to walls as solutions to strategic quagmires. as mentioned before, walls have proven notably effective in places like iraq in tamping down violence. that said, walls also have a shelf-life. in military parlance, walls are delaying obstacles. they can slow down the attacker and in best-case scenarios deter them from attacking in the first place by making the effort not worth the reward. but no historical wall has proven impregnable. determined adversaries have been able to breach them or tunnel under them in time. despite israel's technological edge, hamas has infiltrated under the walls around gaza. north korea was able to tunnel into the demilitarized zone toward south korea, despite it being one of the most fortified areas of the world.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "click here for the fox news app", "augmented": []}
{"original": "partly because walls are only a delaying obstacle, building them is only half the issue. after their construction, they need to be constantly monitored—often the harder task, even with advanced technology. in this sense, the israeli effort around gaza is particularly instructive. the israeli-gaza border after all is comparatively tiny, about 60 kilometers or less than a fiftieth the length of united states-mexican border, and the israelis still need to devote ample technological resources and manpower to watching it. and even so, these walls have not been foolproof.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "walls sometimes can create new ethical dilemmas. walls can become the focal point for conflict. a recent example of this occurred when palestinians—some of them armed—protested near the gaza wall for seven months beginning in march. while accounts vary, human rights groups place the number of casualties at over 5,800 injured and 180 killed. even in less extreme cases, walls—especially in populated areas—may disrupt trade and the free flow of people, inflicting a cost on the local population.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if the united states does indeed build a wall along its southern border and then monitors it effectively, it may succeed in curbing illegal immigration, but it will not end it. walls cannot prevent people from overstaying their visas or being smuggled in another way. and if history is any precedent, illegal immigrants may attempt to tunnel under the wall, go over it or breach it some other way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, walls are a tactic (if, at times, a critical one), but ultimately, not a strategy. because they can provide immediate relief to the problems at hand, walls can buy decisionmakers the time and political space they need for other instruments of power to work, and for those tools to prove decisive. in this sense, walls can enable victory, but rarely are the reason for it. the troubles in ireland came to an end through negotiation and ultimately through a diplomatic accord. the surge reduced violence in iraq partially by co-opting sunni insurgents. and some israeli policymakers attribute the relative peace in the west bank compared to gaza—despite both having walls—at least in part to the west bank's continued economic growth.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "hotels and resorts introduced extended stay programs and packages en masse last year and that trend will continue in 2021 as guests pursue longer stays. travelers will be looking to take fewer trips — if not forced to due to ongoing travel restrictions — but those that do travel are expected to also stay for longer to grab what they can when they can, says globaldata travel & tourism analyst ralph hollister. uncertainty is strife and it may lead to people going 'all out' on one big trip, rather than risking several smaller ones that could be canceled.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "with many travelers opting for longer stays, their trip might not be limited to leisure, and thus they'll be looking for a room they can work from comfortably while enjoying more privacy compared to the on-site business center. fast wi-fi and practical workstations could be the deciding factor for many travelers looking to blend work and play in 2021.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "minimizing touchpoints will continue to be a primary goal across the travel sector in the new year as hotels as well as airports, restaurants and other places have turned to mobile apps and qr codes to reduce the spread of potentially harmful germs. in 2021, hotels will increase their adoption of technology that reduces the number of touchpoints. abilities such as online check-ins and check-outs, mobile keys and room settings controlled by internet of things (iot) technology will become much more commonplace, added hollister. using iot to control room settings also allows hotels to gather more data on guests, creating a more personalized experience when they next return.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "successful properties will be ones that are able to offer guests added flexibility by way of 100% refunds for last-minute cancellations, along with other risk-reducing policies. having a flexible cancelation policy on a hotel website will be vital in ensuring direct bookings, and these relaxed policies will continue in 2021. for example, marriott international has just extended its 24-hour global cancelation policy through march 31, 2021. this extension into next year will be emulated by its rivals in order to remain competitive, hollister predicts.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in addition to flexibility, travelers will be seeking increased privacy in 2021. short-term home rentals through airbnb and vrbo as well as family- and group-friendly villa stays from villas of distinction and others that offer guests more space and privacy than a traditional hotel room will continue to be in high demand. properties in secluded domestic destinations where travelers can worry less about local restrictions and close encounters with strangers will also continue to be popular.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2021, travelers will feel safer spending time outdoors compared to enclosed spaces when it comes to being in public. whether it's meeting and event space, outdoor dining, or inviting green spaces for socially distant coffee breaks or yoga sessions, more and more properties will be looking to incorporate the outdoors into the guest experience.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hotels and resorts have been going green for some time now, and that trend is unlikely to go away in 2021 as more travelers look to limit their impact on the environment and experience the local culture. reducing waste and water usage as well as sourcing locally produced products in on-site bars and restaurants will remain a key for properties looking to differentiate themselves moving forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "reducing contact through touchless technology means offering food and beverage in ways that limit human interactions, whether it's via grab-and-go options in the lobby, room service leaving meals at the guestroom door, or the aforementioned qr codes and scannable menus that allow guests to browse and order from the safety of their smartphone.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "i mean, let's have this conversation later. let me ask you, you're a more moderate democrat. you're worried about bernie sanders. you are for klobuchar or michael bennet, but you're probably now, biden is one of your last hopes. how do you think joe biden is doing and what is he running for tonight, do you know?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "carlson: it doesn't seem like he is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "goodstein: yes. i think that's a fair question. look, he obviously knows what he is running for. when donald trump couldn't say namibia, but he said nambia, did i think he kind of knew that there was a namibia? yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i'm just saying, of course, i think if you listen to joe biden, over hundreds of hours during this campaign answer questions about all the issues that he had to deal with in the white house, yes, i absolutely think he is quite capable.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "carlson: switzerland? like, have you gamed this out yet?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "goodstein: for the first time, bernie is being vetted. hillary gave him a pass. huge mistake, i think in retrospect, and frankly, all the other democrats so far have given him a pass.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "finally, he's an unreconstructed socialist. he's talked about nationalizing telecommunications and banks and everything, and he means it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "again, just like he said, good things about castro. trump has said good things about, you know, the head of north korea and turkey and you know, other authoritarians.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "tammy bruce, fox nation host: yes, it's a little insulting, isn't it? but more insulting might be when he changes -- the only unique thing about pete at this point is his last name. but if he changes that to obama, then he will have everything wrapped up perfectly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "look, this is a guy -- i mean, what else can you do now? but it's not just that. it's tweets that were similar with that speech. he was tweeting the same out, but it's also the cadence. it's not even just plagiarizing the words. it was the rhythm of the delivery, and even some of the gestures, the way that he held his face.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is a guy who wants to be president, who doesn't even have the confidence to be himself. this is a man where there's apparently has no confidence in his own ideas or his own rhetoric or his own ability to inspire people.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "that's one of the other benefits. it's sad perhaps for the pete supporters, but this is what i think also is insulting. he has got about i think 10 percent now black support in south carolina. it is that he may believe here, that if he copies an african-american who is well regarded by the black communities here in america, that he can somehow trick them into voting for him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think that americans, regardless of our skin color deserve a little bit more respect for that, a little bit more regard that everyone, regardless of our complexion, wants to hear real solutions about real issues on policy and this is where he is really dropping the ball to say the least.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: well, it is kind of the end of the road for identity politics. i mean, he is running on who he is rather than what he would do or what he believes in, but he's really going to have to for this to work, convince people that he is a biracial community organizer. i don't think he can pull that off.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bruce: well, that's it. i don't think he can, too. he wants to run as being who he is as a gay man, but then he also wants to run as being someone else. and that's really breaking the barrier when it comes to identity politics, isn't it?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "of course, the reason why you wouldn't tell someone is the fear that they're not going to give you any consent. so the state that talks about affirmative consent when it comes to hiv infection, all of a sudden they're saying, oh, you know, it's not that important.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the reason that they give behind this is what's most troubling to me. so they argue that by treating hiv as a negative by criminalizing hiv, that you're stigmatizing people who are living with hiv. that's a ludicrous argument.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're stigmatizing people who choose to infect someone else with hiv. and they say, well, you know, science and medicine is so much different now that you can take a one a day pill, and you're basically going to be okay. so it's not that big of a deal to have hiv. that's their argument, which of course, there's certainly truth to the point of medicine and how it's no longer the death sentence it once was.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but tell that to someone whose life has been completely impacted having take that pill a day, assuming they can afford the medication over their lifetime. because when you look at the studies that suggests and depending on when you get it and how long you live, you're doing $500,000.00 to a million dollars over your lifetime, just on hiv medication.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: but that's not it -- i mean, even at the level of principle, it's like completely insane that that one illness has been politicized. so it's hard to see clearly, but intentionally transmitting any illness to another person on purpose.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "rantz: they try actually not to make it so that we can hear them talk. that's the problem. so this bill was kind of snuck in there. not a lot of people were paying attention to it until we just caught wind of it and we talked about it on the show.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "carlson: so isn't -- or any disease -- so isn't intentionally infecting some of the disease, why is it different from bio warfare? a sincere question, why is that different?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rantz: yes, from their perspective, they see a victim class that this is being pushed by social justice democrats, who see people living with hiv as victims that are in need of protection.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i generally agree that we obviously have to have compassion for people who are living with hiv, but we should not extend that compassion or understanding to criminals to go from a felony to a misdemeanor. and keep this in mind, in washington state, particularly western washington, they don't prosecute misdemeanors.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "carlson: coronavirus is coming to this country on a large scale. we're not certain when, but the consensus among scientists is it is coming.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "san francisco has no cases yet reported. but the mayor has already declared a state of emergency there. coronavirus is a major test for our government. what is the response to the virus? could the virus drive this country into a recession? and what exactly is administration doing to respond to all of this?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "peter navarro is one of the point men in the administration on coronavirus. he's the white house trade adviser, and he joins us now for answers. peter, thanks so much for coming on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so if you could sum up -- i assume you agree that this is a grave concern. the c.d.c., i think confirmed that today. what's the response to it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "peter navarro, white house trade director: so tucker, there's a four part strategy that we're pursuing in trump time, which is to say as quickly as possible. you start with the personal protective equipment. this is the masks, and the gloves, the tyvek suits, things like that that our public healthcare workers need. we're making sure that we can secure those supplies tomorrow. h.h.s. is going out with an rfp to secure a half a billion face masks alone.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "second thing is the treatment options. we've got three balls in the air on that. there's a drug called remdesivir which is administered intravenously, going through clinical trials. we're trying to secure the dosage for that. we're trying to develop oral antivirals in a very rapid time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and there's something called monoclonal antibodies which help build up the immune system. h.h.s. is working with a company called regeneron on that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so then the next thing, which is the magic bullet, that's the vaccine development. we've already set out a plan to develop a vaccine in less than half the time it usually takes with the combination of private sector efficiencies, and regulatory streamline and then finally, and importantly, there's point of care, diagnostics.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the problem, tucker that we have now is if somebody has symptoms, they have to go to a hospital, take a sample, send it to a lab and wait 48 hours for that. what we're trying to do is adapt existing handheld devices to the coronavirus so that workers out in the field can get instant results.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and tucker, the president has been working on this from the day that he pulled down the planes from china on, i think, it was january 29th. we're focused like a laser beam on this to keep the public secure. we're hoping for the best, preparing for the worst and we're doing it all on trump time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: interesting. are you confident that the administration has a sense of how many people might be infected in the united states?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "navarro: yes, i am. the problem is what's going on in the rest of the world and how these vectors are going to impact us. but the issue here is to be ready, be prepared.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the important thing, tucker, in contrasting this with the china situation is, if it comes here, what you want to do is stretch out the amount of time where people get contagious and infected, that will give our healthcare system the ability to process that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's going on in china now is horrific. there's triage so that if you have anything but the coronavirus, heart attack, broken leg, whatever, you don't get care and you die. we don't want that to happen here obviously.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: it seems that -- no, we don't. peter navarro, thanks so much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "carlson: good to see you. as we go tonight, we have a fixture on the screen. it is the birthday of our executive producer justin wells. we can't tell you how old he is because we don't know, but we do know he is the single best producer in all of television.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "corke: from the situation room, rose garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the eisenhower executive office building, president trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "schumer: it's very hard to see how progress would be made unless they open up the government.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "corke: now, 16 days into the shutdown, it is clear that despite increased face-to-face engagement, cooler heads haven't prevailed. in fact, the president turned up the heat, warning that he would consider using a national emergency to get his wall funding if democrats won't budge.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump: absolutely. we can do it. i haven't done it. i may do it. i may do it.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "sarah huckabee sanders, white house press secretary: great to be with you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: so. what is the latest on the negotiations? did they make any progress yesterday?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: well, they made some progress yesterday. the fact that they're sitting down at the table is some progress, in and of itself. but, they've got a long way to go. i mean, democrats set down, the first thing that one of the individuals from the democrats' side said in the meeting was, we're not here to make an agreement.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, this was the beginning of a conversation that still has i think a lot left to be worked out. they're going to meet again later this afternoon, and hopefully, they'll continue to make progress and continue to move the ball down the field.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "at the end of the day, though, democrats have said over and over again that they support border security, that they support protecting american citizens -- now, it's time to fulfill some of those statements that they've made -- work with the president, let's get this done; let's open the government back up.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: well, of course, the question is -- is the wall the best way to do it? and i'm going to ask you about that in a minute.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but again, going back to friday, the president meant what he said, that he is prepared to fight for the wall, to continue the shutdown for months or even years?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: well, i think that's one of the things that people misunderstand. the president's not fighting for the wall; he's fighting for the protection of american citizens.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: but he wants the wall to do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: absolutely. he wants the wall and he wants a number of other things. we have a completely broken immigration system. we have national crisis, not just of safety and security, but a humanitarian crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have drugs, we have human traffickers, we have terrorists that come across our border and there has to be a stop to that and we want to do -- not just the wall; certainly that's one of the most important factors. we know that it works; we know that in the places that it's been, it's 95 percent effective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we want to be effective across the board and that includes the wall and other technology along the --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: but you're not answering my question. he meant what he said. he's prepared to continue this fight, this shutdown, for months or even years?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: absolutely, the president means what he says when he says that. but it would be outrageous for democrats who agree with the president -- that's what's the most outrageous thing to me, and something that frankly is so just incomprehensible -- they agree with the president. they agree that we need border security. they just are unwilling to let this president win.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think at some point they have to decide that they care more about americans than fighting the president. and so far, we haven't seen a willingness on their side to fully do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: but let's talk about caring about americans, because house democrats this week passed six bills that would fund eight agencies, unrelated to homeland security, unrelated to the wall, that would get them back going right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the question is, why not sign that bill, fund those agencies that have nothing to do with the border wall, and not hold those hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and the services they provide, hostage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: we're not holding anybody hostage. the president wants to fund the government; he wants to open the government --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: but you could open those eight other agencies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: chris, we've been having this debate for years. at some point, we have to say, enough is enough. until we can come together, we can be reasonable, which we have put forth in good faith multiple offers to democrats to say, let's make a deal. let's have a discussion; let's get to a place where we agree.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have to stop kicking the can down the road and just continuing to say, let's do it again in 30 days. let's do it in 45 days.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: no, no, no. but do you -- but i'm not talking about homeland security. that -- you can continue to fight about that, if you want, and you shut it down -- but why hold agriculture hostage? why hold justice hostage? why hold the treasury department hostage?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "why not fund them? they have nothing to do with a border wall.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: the president wants to do this all at once. he knows it's better if they can focus on getting all of these packages done at one time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: isn't the real reason, because you want the leverage from all the agencies?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: it's not just -- it's not that. but you also have to look at the six bills. those aren't the budget that we submitted, either. there are a lot of discrepancies between what we --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: those have all been approved by republicans in the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: they have. i'm not saying we oppose those six. i'm just saying, to make it like this is an easy deal; we want to be able to negotiate, but at the same time you can't just keep passing the buck. this is a major point of contention. and let's just sit down and work it out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: ok. but if this shutdown lags on, not months or years, but even in to february, it's going to start to hurt real people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "take a look at this, sarah. federal tax refunds will be delayed. food stamps for 38 million americans will be cut. millions of people will lose rental assistance payments and union leaders say hundreds of tsa workers are already off the job because they can't afford to get to work. president trump thinks the border wall is worth all of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. but you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? he never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to officer singh of california's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. this shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "every life -- that's what sets america apart from every other country; we value life. that it's what makes us unique. and the day that we stop doing that, even if it's one, 10 or 100,000, that's when we stop being the greatest country on the face of this earth.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "not only people like that, but we also have a massive influx of drugs that come across the southern border. ninety percent of the heroin that comes into this country comes across through the southern border and 300 americans are killed from that every single month.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: we have to look at it across the board.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: let's talk about the wall. because there is no question that there has been a big spike in the number of family units coming across the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border. and here is secretary of homeland security nielsen. take a look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kirstjen nielsen, secretary of homeland security: the cbp has stopped over 3,000 what we call special interest aliens trying to come into the country in the southern border. those are aliens who the intel community has identified are of concern.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: but special interest aliens are just people who come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist. they're not terrorists themselves. and the state department says that there is, quote, their words: no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from mexico.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: we know that roughly, nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: wait, wait, wait -- i know the statistic; i didn't know you were going to use it. but i studied up on this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "do you know where those 4,000 people come -- where they're captured? airports.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: certainly a large number --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: the state department says there hasn't been any terrorists that they've found coming across the southern border with mexico.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: it's by air, it's by land and it's by sea. it's all of the above. but one thing that you're forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border, and we have to protect it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the more individuals that --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: but they're not coming across the southern border, sarah. they're coming and they're being stopped at airports.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: they're coming a number of ways. they're certainly -- i'm not disagreeing with you that they're coming through airports. i'm saying that they come by air, by land and by sea.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do american citizens harm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: ok. the president now says, and this was a revelation on friday, that he can go around congress and build this wall on his own. take a look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "trump: we can call a national emergency, because of the security of our country, absolutely. no, we can do it. i haven't done it. i may do it. i may do it. but we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: how serious is he about that? has the white house drafted an emergency order? a resolution that he could, that he could -- that he could announce tomorrow -- we're going to declare a national emergency; we're going to build the wall. has he set a deadline for when he's going to end talks and simply say, i'm going to go off on my own and do it? and is he really prepared --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: that's a lot of questions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: is he really prepared -- it's still the same question, which is - - how serious is he? is he really prepared to go off on his own and use money that was authorized for military construction and build a wall instead?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: the president's prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders, to protect the people of this country; he knows that the number one job he has as president and commander-in-chief is to protect its citizens. and if he doesn't take that seriously, whether it's at our southern border or whether it's from terrorists coming from whatever way they come, or any other place that --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: and does he really think he has --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: -- they can try to do harm to americans, then he is not going to be the president that he knows himself to be, and he has shown himself to be over the last two years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: and he really, just quickly -- does he really think that he has the authority to build the wall with funds that were appropriated for the military construction without congressional approval?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: as we've said for the last several weeks, we're looking and exploring every option available that the president has, whether --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: and is that a viable option?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful and we're looking at every option we can. this is something the president takes incredibly seriously, is very passionate about, and is not going to stop until he figures out the best way to make sure we're doing everything we can to make america safer and more secure.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: i've got less than a minute left.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "president trump is at camp david today to meet with white house senior officials about his priorities for 2019.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what can you tell us about the meeting and about what his agenda is?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: we had an incredible first two years under the president trump. the economy is strong. isis has been on the run. the judiciary is being made.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have just a number of successes over these first two years. we want to look at how we're going to continue to build on those as we move into 2020.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: i think the president's got a lot. immigration certainly has to be at the forefront. right now, that's one of the biggest things that we have to get done is securing our border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but not just securing the border, but fixing the immigration system as a whole; it's completely broken. the president wants to make sure we look at all of the different things, loopholes we can close, to make that better. infrastructure, fighting the opioid crisis -- those are going to be things that also not only are the president's big priorities, but things we think we might be able to get democrats to actually work with us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the american people elected them to come here and do more than just fight the president and we hope that they'll fulfill their constituents' hopes for them and do exactly that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: thanks for coming in today. always good to talk to you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "sanders: always great to be here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: up next, reaction from a top house democrat - what's their plan to end the shutdown? and what about those calls to impeach the president?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: house democrats have an ambitious agenda as they take over the majority from infrastructure to health care, to investigations of the trump administration. but their first priority is to end the government shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "joining us now from rhode island, one of their new leaders, congressman david cicilline, chair of the house democratic policy and communications committee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "congressman, what's the latest on where negotiations stand? are your -- is your side willing to compromise with the president on the border wall, or are you, in effect, demanding his surrender?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rep. david cicilline, d-r.i.: no, i don't think we are demanding a surrender, but what we're demanding is that the government be reopened. we passed appropriations bill that were passed unanimously by the senate. they were supported by republicans. there was an agreement on those bills.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president at the last moment changed his mind and that deal fell apart. so, we are trying to isolate the disagreement. so, we passed again the senate approved version that -- it was the republican path forward. that passed the house in a bipartisan way with republicans and democrats. we sent that to the senate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what we are saying is open of the government. we'll have a short-term extension so we can resolve this disagreement. but we need to reopen the government and the president has really held this --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: let me just interrupt for a second, because speaker pelosi and democratic senate leader schumer have been hinting at this on friday after the meeting, is that the democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: i mean, i think we believe the government must reopen immediately. i mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the tsa. i mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. the president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. it's impacting people's lives.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so, what we are saying is open the government. there's agreement, bipartisan agreement on funding the government. let's isolate the disagreement, the department of homeland security and continue talking.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: all right. let's talk about the merits of a border wall. here's what new speaker nancy pelosi says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., speaker of the house: we are not doing a wall. does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? the wall, in my view, is an immorality. it is, again, a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the american people. but it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: i want to ask you a specific question, congressman, why is a wall immoral? i'm not asking why it's ineffective or why you think the money could be spent better, but the speaker keeps saying the wall is immoral. there's a wall or a fence around the white house. people build walls around their homes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "why is a border wall immoral?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: i think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders. we have appropriated $1.7 billion over the last two years for border security. the department has spent less than 6 percent. but we are prepared to do more because we need to do more, but we want to do it in a way that's effective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: if i may just press, why is a wall immoral?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: well, that's a question the speaker will have to answer, but i think what she means by that is it doesn't reflect our values as a country, that america has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants, people who are fleeing violence and war.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. it doesn't achieve the objective. democrats are committing to securing our borders. we have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: but let's use technology, let's use drones, let's use satellites, let's do cargo inspections, which aren't happening. let's do things that will actually secure the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: ok. but let's talk about the effectiveness of it. brandon judd is the president of the national border patrol council. he's been a border patrol agent for 21 years. here's what he says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "brandon judd, national border patrol council president: anywhere that you look where we have built walls, they have worked. they have been an absolute necessity for border patrol agents in securing the border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: here's a guy who has been on the front lines, on the border for two decades. he says border walls work.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: well, look, i think there's no question there are places we have walls and fencing and other kind of barriers. i think good border security is going to be a combination of things. but what we've heard of from the president is he wants a big great concrete wall that will be a thousand miles --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: no, no, he's given up on the concrete wall. he is talking about steel fencing out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: but i think the reality is this is actually a fight the president has created to distract from the real issues that he's facing. the fact is the republicans were in control of the house, the senate and the white house for two years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? he waited to the lame duck. why? because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. his foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. the gentleman heading the isis effort resigned.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: it was a bad couple of weeks. so what does the president do? he shuts the government down and he's distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: but, sir, the fact is, even the washington post today said that there is now a crisis at the border. there has been a dramatic spike in the number of family units coming across the southern border.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i want to put up some statistics. in november of 2017, a year plus ago, the border patrol apprehended 7,000 family units at our southwest border. this past november, two months ago, they caught 25,000 family units coming across.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "wallace: let me just interrupt because i have two minutes left and i want to get to questions in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: the president said on friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from sarah sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. if he goes ahead and does that, what will house democrats like yourself do?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: well, i don't think the president has that authority. he would have to meet a very high standard. article one establishes the congress of the united states and gives us the responsibility of appropriating money.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i don't think the president has the authority to do that, and i hope you will continue to try to work with congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first. this -- the government will reopen when the republicans in the senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn't be shutting down the government if they don't get their way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: finally, i've got less than a minute, finally, freshman congresswoman rashida tlaib -- and i know you were expecting this question -- of michigan said this on thursday night.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rep. rashida tlaib, d-mich.: when your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won. bullies don't win. and i said, baby, they don't, because we're going to go in there and we're going to the mother (expletive deleted).", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: what do you think of the language and what do you think of the idea of moving right away to impeach president trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: well, look, democrats ran on the agenda for the people, to drive down health care costs, drive down the cost of prescription drugs, raise family incomes by rebuilding american.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: i got all of that and i got a little time but specifically --", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: look, i think we need to move forward on our agenda. at the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. i'm one of the people who think we have to wait for mr. mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: and really quick, yes or no, do you condemn that language?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cicilline: look -- i'm not going to -- look, it's kind of odd to hear people on the republican side who have not condemned the president's language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language. like, look, this is a private event, she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate. the fundamental issues democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we're going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives, and we're going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "congressman chaffetz, there was an interesting development in the last couple of days. a few -- three, as i could them, senate republicans who were up for re-election in 2020 are now beginning to break with the president and say, we need to reopen the government. cory gardner of colorado, susan collins of maine, tom tillis of north carolina.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jason chaffetz, contributor: well, i wish i could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and i hope it's sooner rather than later. but i think the democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the border patrol, wants to do. they had 60,000 people they apprehended in november coming across the border. and when the border patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i'm sensitive to cory gardner, who's a great member of the united states senate, but now is the -- congress always gravitates to deadlines and pressure points. and that's what i think is ultimately going to get this solved is the need, the desire to solve this now rather than continuing to punt it down the road.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: mo, are the democrats the one who were in a hole and are going to need to get out of it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mo elleithee, contributor: i don't think so. i think most americans would agree that this is the president's shutdown and that the president is basically holding hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage over -- over this. and it's not just them. it's the people who contract with the federal government, people who aren't getting paid, people who are worried about paying the bills, people who are worried about paying their rent, people who may get stuck at airports. this is all -- these are the pressure points that are really going to move this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think to say that you're going to continue this for years over an argument, an immigration argument that is actually not proven to be effective, that is sort of in -- where there has bene a wall, we have seen breaches time and time again, almost 10,000 breaches among certain sectors of the wall that exist now. rather than taking that money and investing in actual technologies that would provide real border security, investigating in more border patrol agents, that, to me, seems like a better way to go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "to keep the government shutdown and hurt all these people over kind of a fantasy answer i think is going to come back and hurt the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: i'll let you answer about the fencing answer. but -- but, i mean, here's the problem it seems to me. if the -- if nancy pelosi were to say tomorrow, all right, we're going to give you the money for the wall, she'd be thrown out as speaker. her -- her house democratic caucus would not stand for that. if the president were to say, you know what, i give up on the wall, his political base, that 39, 40 percent would turn on him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where does the pressure come and is going to be a surrender by one side to the other? are they going to sort of lay down the instruments of war? or is there going to be a compromise that involves something that the president ends up giving to democrats, whether it's on daca, the dreamers, people with temporary protected status,, whatever?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jonah goldberg, contributor: yes, so that' -- that's part of the irony here, right, is the fight over this is almost purely symbolic now. it is a, if they win, we lose, zero sum understanding that if trump gets anything he can claim victory for, democrats will feel like it's a loss, and vice versa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the irony is, is that there are serious public policy compromises that could be found here on daca. there are serious restriction, like my friend mark krikorian (ph), who argued for, you know, things like e-verify that are much more important than a wall. but the problem is --", "augmented": []}

{"original": "goldberg: right. and so i -- to answer the question about the pressure point thing, it seems to me that if you actually end up -- right now it's a lot of posturing from the tsa and their union. but it seems to me that if - - if -- if airports start essentially shutting down and rip people out and the rest of the country start to feel the bite, that is where i think the pressure really starts to build. that moves markets. that's going to cause congressman to start buckling.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "right now overflowing garbage cans on the mall is not exactly -- i drove past it this morning. it's not exactly like a scene from a mad max movie out there. but as time goes by, i think those are the pressure points. and you can see a lot of senators get weak in the knees about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: all right, i'm -- i'm going to ask all of you for a prediction in a moment, but if not for the shutdown, the big political story this week would be the house going back to the democrats, nancy pelosi regaining the speakership after eight years in the minority, in the first speaker to regain the gavel since sam rayburn in the 1950s.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "marie harf, analyst: absolutely. and i -- i think i was one of those democrats that underestimated her ability to win back the speakership with the kind of numbers she got. the fact that alexandria ocasio-cortez voted for her in the end is just a symbol of the fact that she was able to win back that speakership in a way that showed her strength and her legislative ability.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the two things the democratic house have done now legislatively, they've introduced a bill to -- on voting rights, to get corruption out of washington, and they've passed bills to reopen the government. so i think they put down a marker this week that they are not here to play. they have an agenda. they're going to push it forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "she will have, i think, some challenges bringing together this moderate block of democrats who re-won the house in places like michigan. elissa slotkin, coming up later on the show, she's one of them. she is a moderate. she is not an abolish ice democrat. combine that with aoc and the liberal wing of the party, going into a presidential election --", "augmented": []}

{"original": "chaffetz: well, this is not the -- candidate romney didn't -- didn't talk like this. that's not who he was. he accepted his endorsement in october. in a debate he was asked a question and he said he's putting the past behind him. he looks to working forward.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "chaffetz: i think he does believe it. i think it's in his heart. but -- and i don't think that it's going to do anything to actually move the meter and accomplish things. i don't -- i don't know why he would do it before he was sworn in. i think a lot of people are scratching their head.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: all right. we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on romney's criticism of president trump. mike johnson sent this on facebook. when is he switching to the democratic party, because he obviously is no longer a republican? and jean caragher tweeted this, is he positioning himself to challenge president trump for the 2020 nomination?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "marie, how do you answer them?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "harf: well, in response to the first question, i think that's actually a problem the republican party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, president trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for republicans to criticize president trump. and if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent donald trump base. so i think what will be interesting is what this senate does as we get the mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't think mitt romney's going to challenge donald trump in 2020. that's just my instinct. i do think john kasich might. i think jeff flake might. and a lot will depend on the mueller report. this is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and once we get that, i think you'll see some republicans make some decisions about that primary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: then there was, and we talked about this before with congressman cicilline, congresswoman -- freshman congresswoman rashida tlaib of michigan and her attack this week on the president, her obscene attack, and president trump's response.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "wallace: jonah, this clearly, in the very first week that the house democrats took over and had done a lot of very careful things in terms of messaging, stepped on their message, the fact that we're talking about it, the fact that cable news has feasted on this. and i think, one, what do you think of that, and, two, the fact that this really indicate how much trouble nancy pelosi is going to have controlling some of the firebrands in her party?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "goldberg: no, i think that's right. i think there are two issues here. one, the expletive, which she should have apologized for and just moved on. i don't think president trump has an enormous amount of credibility condemning that kind of language or debasing discourse in any way.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. and nancy pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides republicans, that peels off republicans. and the one thing that will keep republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. if it just becomes -- if the democratic party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the republican party, which i think is a real concern, of just the anti-trump party, than that will unify the republicans.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and so get -- staying quiet about impeachment is totally in nancy pelosi's and the democrat's long-term interest until there's a reason to actually talk about impeachment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: i mean, in fairness, we heard congressman cicilline today say exactly that, and jerry nadler, who is the chair of the house judiciary committee, which is where this issue of impeachment, if it's going to come up, would come up, said the same thing this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "goldberg: but it's a problem. but that's not with the rank and file want, right? in the same way that the rank and file of the republican party wants it to be an always trump all trump party, the rank and file of the democratic party wants it to be an always anti-trump party here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: well, let me ask mo about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "one, what do you make of tlaib's statement, plus her refusal afterwards to apologize? and how much of a fever is there in the house democratic caucus to move right now and impeach donald trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elleithee: so, on the comment, i'd -- i'd -- i'd be hard-pressed to disagree with anything jonah said. the -- i spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and i think that is wrong and i don't think democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize democrats for acting like him. so i wish he wouldn't have used that language.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "elleithee: and i do think it is premature. i think most members of house democratic leadership agree with that. most members of house democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way tom steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. there may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and bob mueller will let everyone know when that time is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, until then, democrats have a policy agenda to push. they've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. and they have an election to win. if they want to beat donald trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. they've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. that should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: we've got about a minute left, marie.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there was a very interesting moment on friday because president trump came out to the rose garden after his meeting with nancy pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on democrats who want to impeach.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "harf: i think that's right, but they always condition it -- always, always -- in the leadership of the democratic caucus right now on the mueller report. that we cannot do this for political reasons, like it appeared with bill clinton or like tom steyer is doing. so i think they will keep it on the table conditioned on mueller.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: all right. thank you, panel. see you next sunday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "up next, our power players of the week. we're going to introduce you to two new members of congress and ask how they plan to reach across the aisle and end the shutdown.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: with the old guard in washington not getting much done, we met this week with two new members of the 116 congress to get their fresh ideas. we sat down with democrat elissa slotkin of michigan, who served three tours in iraq with the cia, and with republican mark green of tennessee, who was on the special ops team that captured saddam hussein. and they are our power players of the week.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "let me start with you, congresswoman slotkin. how?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "slotkin: sure. well, the perfect example is the government shutdown right now. we have the basis of a deal, right? both sides are saying they care about border security. they believe in national security. start having a real negotiation about border security, border forces, more technology at the border, fencing if we needed it in some areas. it doesn't just have to be a wall. that's the essence of a negotiation.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i think we can start now if people really care about getting something done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: you're talking about the issues, i guess i'm talking more about attitude. because it's -- you know, there are problems there and people have known about possible deals, possible solutions for a long time, but it never gets done. why not?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "green: i think what we, as a class, the freshman class, brings, particularly the congresswoman and i, is, you know, a life of service to the country. you know, she's prior military, i'm prior military and we want solutions. and we're just sick and tired of it not happening. and our constituents sent us here to get it done. so we're -- we're rolling up our sleeves and going to -- going to get it done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: well, i want to pick up on that because congressman green was a special operations flight surgeon in iraq, part of the capture of saddam hussein. you served for years in the cia, then for presidents bush 43 and obama, a republican and democrat. what's the one thing that you think you can take from your service in national security and maybe help you here in washington?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "slotkin: i mean, for me, it's mission, right? you have a mission. and when you're serving in the cia or military, you wake up every day, you know what you're doing and why you're doing it. and i think it's no different in congress. some people have treated it as if they don't have a mission, that they're there for themselves, they're show horses, whatever. i think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: there are a lot of very well-intentioned people in that building behind me and somehow it doesn't get done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "let's take the shutdown. the wall that the president says has to be a wall or, you know, some version of a wall. you hear nancy pelosi say a wall is immoral. how do you compromise from that kind of rhetoric?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "green: i think we find, you know, some common ground with what is border security and we get it done. i mean that's really what we have to do. and, you know, the president has looked at this and has said, this is what we need to do and, you know, i'm supporting him in this -- in this effort.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "slotkin: i just think it -- literally, life is about negotiations. there is no one who lives their lives just saying i'm going to unilaterally decide what happen. so, negotiate. get in the room, kick out the cameras and get something done.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: where are you both on donald trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "question for you, congresswoman slotkin, are the democrats, particularly in the house, too anti-trump?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "slotkin: i think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that i love. and, for me, that's critically important. i don't like policy by twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. if we're only anti-trump, we are not doing our job.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: on the other hand, congressman, you said during the campaign you can't imagine an issue where you would differ with donald trump.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "green: so far every action he's taken has been spectacular, from cutting taxes that created massive growth at least in our state in tennessee, to one of the biggest pay raises for our veterans -- our soldiers in -- in ten plus years. you know, i -- i think the actions that he's taken are spectacular and i can't see an area where i would disagree with him at this point.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "it's the federal no-fly list, a collection of names of people who are not allowed to board commercial flights into or out of the united states. according to leaked documents obtained by the intercept, more than 47,000 people were on america's no-fly list as of august 2013. that number reportedly includes 800 americans, many of whom don't even know they're on it. the government sends no official notification to those on the list; many times, people don't find out until they're denied boarding at the airport.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "a number of high-profile lawsuits have claimed the government unjustly added people to the list and blocked their efforts to have their names removed. last summer, a federal court ruled in favor of 13 people who claimed the government violated their constitutional rights to travel by placing them on the no-fly list. the government was ordered to tell the plaintiffs whether they're on the list, spell out the reasons they are barred from travel, and to give them a chance to challenge the government finding.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "despite the secrecy, various court cases, news reports and leaked documents have shed some light on the process behind the no-fly list. here are eight possible ways one can end up on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "1. being suspected of direct terrorist activity", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this one may be obvious, but of course known terrorists end up on the no-fly list. the man who tried to bomb a northwest airlines flight in 2009 and the man convicted of planting a car bomb in times square in 2010 both were on the no-fly list (they were able to board planes anyway). last year, the intercept obtained a secret document issued by the national counterterrorism center that details how the government puts people on the no-fly list as well as on terrorist databases. it lists people convicted of or arrested for acts of terrorism, bombers, hostage takers, assassins, associates of terror groups, and others. according to the document, federal agencies can nominate someone for a government blacklist if an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism and/or terrorist activities.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "according to the guardian, the justice department has also said that authorities must have a reasonable suspicion that someone poses a threat before they put them on a watch list. however, civil liberties activists have argued that reasonable suspicion is extremely subjective.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "frequent trips to a known trouble spot can raise a red flag. if you travel to certain places, the likelihood is you get more scrutiny, says mann. if you travel frequently to countries that are known to be involved in terrorism or financial crimes, you do run the risk of having your travels alerted more carefully.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "3. something you said in the past", "augmented": []}
{"original": "there are numerous complaints from non-violent political activists who say they ended up on a no-fly list for something they said. former princeton university professor walter murphy told the guardian that in 2007, he was denied a boarding pass in newark international airport. he suspects it was because of a high-profile lecture he gave that had been critical of then-president bush. in 2012, wade hicks, the spouse of a navy lieutenant, claimed he was told he was on a no-fly list. he thinks it was because of comments he made about 9/11.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "4. have a similar name to someone on the no-fly list", "augmented": []}
{"original": "this is a common complaint from those who claim they are on the no-fly list unjustly. if you have a name which is similar in sound or spelling or in phonetical interpretation to someone who probably legitimately should be on the list, you're at risk for finding yourself on the list, says mann. he cites a friend of his who shares a last name with an irish republican army operative who was active in the 1960s and 1970s. that unfortunate coincidence, says mann, landed not only his friend on the list but also the man's son — who wasn't even born during this operative's heyday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in 2007, 60 minutes famously brought together a group of people named robert johnson who experienced problems flying, likely because a man also named robert johnson had been convicted of plotting to bomb a hindu temple and a movie theatre in toronto.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "according to a lawsuit detailed in wired magazine, a stanford university doctoral student was placed on the no-fly list in 2004. after seven years of federal lawsuits, it was determined she was unjustly put on the list because an fbi agent had checked the wrong box on a form.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mann says you may not even have to be suspected of terrorism to get on a no-fly list. in some cases, people have either open warrants or some other characteristic indicating criminal activity and then they find themselves on this list, he says, even when the alleged activity has nothing to do with aviation security. mann believes that's a sign the no-fly list has morphed beyond an air security tool into an all-out law enforcement tactic. this has mission-creeped into something that is much wider in scope than was originally intended, he says.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the government guidelines published by the intercept barred agencies from blacklisting people based on information that is unreliable or not credible. but it does point out that social media posts should not automatically be discounted when deciding whether someone belongs on a blacklist. agencies are instructed to evaluate the credibility of the source, as well as the nature and specificity of the information, and nominate even if that source is uncorroborated.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but don't worry: chances are your tweet will not land you on a no-fly list. writing the tsa on twitter with some negative comments about your experience at such-and-such airport won't do anything other than get you a 'sorry' from the tsa, says mann. there's so many of those, half the traveling public would be on the darned list.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cruz: i think it is certainly possible that this trial could last one to two weeks. on the other hand, if the senate makes decision to go down the road of additional witnesses, that could extend it six, eight weeks, or even longer. so i think there are really two paths here. but what you just noted there is important. this week is going to be the first time in a year that the president has had the opportunity to defend himself, to lay out the facts, to lay out the law, to lay out the actual substance. we have seen months and months and months of a one-sided show trial from house democrats, where they didn't want to hear from the defense, where they shut out the white house, where they shut out the minority. the good news is, in the senate, what i'm confident of is, we're going to have a fair trial. we're not going to give in to the kind of games that house democrats have played. instead, we're going to give both sides a full and fair opportunity to present their case. the house managers will have every opportunity to stand up and to present their arguments, to put forth whatever evidence they have. but for the first time, the president and the white house defense team is going to be able to walk through the facts and substance. and i think that's a very, very important development.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bartiromo: let's talk about your reciprocity resolution. so if you were to go down the road of witnesses, you want it to be reciprocal. tell us about that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cruz: well, that's right. it's kind of strange how we got here. so democrats have been having hearings, have been doing impeachment for months in the house. they brought in all sorts of witnesses. they blocked the minority from having any witnesses. and then, as soon as we get to the senate, the democratic talking point is, we want more witnesses. never mind all the witnesses they called before. they want yet more. and they're trying to delay this. they're trying to drag this out. they want this trial to go on forever, because they have a political objective of attacking the president. what i have said and what i have urged the conference is, is, listen, if we go down the road of witnesses, we're not going to do what the house did. we're not going to have a one-sided kangaroo court. instead, we're going to respect reciprocity. what does that mean? that means, if the prosecution gets a witness, the defense gets a witness. if the prosecution gets two, the defense gets two. that means, if the prosecution gets to call john bolton, then the president gets to call hunter biden. and i got to tell you, the democrats are terrified about seeing a witness like hunter biden testify, because they don't want to hear evidence of actual corruption, of corruption, potentially, of joe biden, corruption that occurred during the obama administration. they blocked all those witnesses in the house. they're not going to succeed in blocking them in the senate.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "bartiromo: what would that open up a whole 'nother can of worms? i mean, obviously, this whole focus on the president and this impeachment trial has put hunter biden and joe biden to the backseat. no one is actually talking about what went wrong there and why he accepted this money from foreign countries, leadership of foreign countries, while his father was sitting vice president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cruz: well, maria, you're right. and the democrats desperately want to keep that topic off the news. and, sadly, an awful lot of folks in the media are very compliant with that. but that's why i said this week the president having the opportunity to defend himself is so important, because i think one of the fundamental defenses that i expect to hear from the white house this week is that the president has inherent authority and, in fact, a responsibility to investigate corruption. and when you look at what happened with joe biden and hunter biden, there is, at a minimum, prima facie evidence of corruption. you have got hunter biden getting paid $83,000 a month by burisma, the largest natural gas company in ukraine; $83,000 a month is a million dollars a year.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cruz: hunter biden had zero experience in oil and gas. it's not like he was a geologist or geophysicist. he was getting that money, the obvious inference is, because his daddy was vice president. and joe biden is on video at the council of foreign relations bragging that he blocked a billion dollars in foreign loans and foreign aid to ukraine until they fired the prosecutor who was potentially investigating burisma, the company on which hunter biden sat on the board. when -- if the biden family is profiting to the tunes of millions of dollars, the president is entirely justified to say, let's investigate and find out what happened. that's why hunter biden is such an important witness and why the democrats don't want to focus on, what was the evidence of actual corruption? i expect to hear a lot from that -- from the white house defense team this week.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "bartiromo: you have got a 51-vote threshold in terms of getting that vote to hear witnesses. do you want to hear from witnesses? then i want to get your take on the white house's letter sent last night, basically calling the articles of impeachment violations of the constitution.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cruz: well, starting with the second part first, i do think what we have seen coming out of the house is an abuse of the constitution. and the reason is that they're using this for political purposes. this is the first time in history any president is alleged -- has been impeached without the articles alleging any criminal conduct at all, without alleging any federal crime was violated. they don't allege any federal law was violated. they don't even allege as much as that the president has a speeding ticket, and that has never happened in our country's history. and to use impeachment, like the house democrats are doing, to express their political disagreement with the president, to try to overturn an election they're unhappy with, that is an abuse of the constitution. now, the first question you asked about process and witnesses, let me tell you what we can -- what we can expect to see in the next week or two going forward. on tuesday, when we come back, the senate will convene at 1:00 p.m. and we will start with pretrial motions. we will start with probably battling motions. what i expect the senate to do is adopt a scheduling order laying out the next couple of weeks. that scheduling order is modeled after the scheduling order for the bill clinton impeachment. it's very, very similar. so it provides that we start with the house managers getting 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. they can argue evidence.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they can argue law and argue whatever they want. after that, the president and the white house, they get 24 hours spread over two days to present their case. then we shift questions from senators. senators get 16 hours. our questions have to be in writing, and the chief justice asks them for us. all of that, i would anticipate, takes about a week -- a week to a week-and-a-half. at that point, what the scheduling order provides is, the senate is going to vote on whether or not additional witnesses are necessary. that's a 51- vote threshold. i don't know how that vote is going to come out. i think all 47 democrats will vote yes. the open question is whether there will be four republicans to join with those 47 democrats. and, look, i think some of that depends on what happens in the first week- and-a-half, what arguments the house managers put forward, what arguments the white house puts forward, what questions comes out. i hope, at the end of the week-and-a-half, where republican senators are is -- is, we have heard enough. the evidence they have put forward doesn't satisfy the constitutional standards. the constitution says, impeachment lies for high crimes and misdemeanors.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cruz: this wasn't a high crime or misdemeanor. they didn't allege any crime at all. and so i hope, at the end of this process, that we will get at least 51 votes to say, let's move to final judgment. and when we move to final judgment...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cruz: ... the outcome of this is going to be, the president will be acquitted. the senate will vote not guilty. and the reason i can say that with confidence is because, on their face, the articles of impeachment, they don't allege high crimes and misdemeanors. they fail on their face. and so i hope we get 51 votes in a week-and-a-half to say, this is over. if not, if not, if there are at least four republicans who joined the democrats for witnesses, then we're looking at a trial that will probably last six, eight weeks or longer...", "augmented": []}

{"original": "cruz: and the reason is, i think dismissing this cases is a much less attractive option than rendering final judgment and acquitting the president.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jordan: yes. and one of them even -- one of the fbi agents even said they didn't think he was lying at the time. but they later then said that he -- that he did. yes, they tried to set him up. they did set him up. but this is not unusual, because -- well, it should be unusual, but the fbi did it another time as well. they did it on january 6 at trump tower, when it was president-elect trump. they went up there and briefed president-elect trump on the dossier, the dossier they already knew was false. they went and briefed the president on it, so they could go then leak it to the press, and the press could write about it. and they tried to set up the president-elect of the united states in the same manner. so this is how they operate. and they got caught. think about what mr. horowitz told us last month, maria. he told us that the fbi, when they went to get the carter page warrant to spy on the trump campaign, they lied to the court 17 times in the initial application and the three renewals; 17 times, they lied to the court. and now what's interesting, is lisa page and peter strzok, the two individuals who were in charge of that investigation, got in a little spat now with rod rosenstein, who was also involved.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "you might notice the desk on the podium there as well. that is because the president will be signing an interior department decision that is related to water rights. but the president began his day today, neil, heading from vegas, where he overnighted, to the palm springs area for fund-raising, millions of dollars, in fact, raised during a reception at the estate of oracle co-founder larry ellison.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "also a couple of protesters on the hand. unlikely to be an issue when he gets here, where mr. trump will be seeking the support and, of course, the votes in election 2020 of ordinary farmers. as part of that, as i just mentioned, he's expected to sign off on an interior department decision that rolls back endangered species protections that have essentially curbed water deliveries to central valley farmers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so that's going to be a very popular move the president will make with the audience here. it will be very well-received. but as you were mentioning, neil, as he makes this western swing, the president very much is keeping his eyes on nevada and that democratic debate stage, which will be full of the candidates tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "mr. trump over the last few days has certainly seemed focused on the candidacy of former new york mayor mike bloomberg. and the president has been happy to echo some of bloomberg's democratic opponents concerns about the possibility or the accusation, at least, that bloomberg is -- quote -- trying to buy the nomination away from the front-runner, bernie sanders.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "wolf: i think the best way to look at it is, unfortunately for us democrats, there is no one coalescing around one moderate candidate.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "so i think we talked about the other day i certainly feel like the moderate side is a silent majority. but as long as we're doing what obama said not to do, that good old circular firing squad we have going on right now...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: well, it's alive and well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wolf: it's no question about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: so, when you look at it, joe, i mean, how -- the president is planning just to sort of steal their thunder. usually, he plans an event right up to that moment. no different this time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it does steal their thunder, and i think he's enjoying their disarray.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "joseph pinion, republican strategist: yes, look, i think he likes to give the side-by-side comparison.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so you have president trump over here with six million new jobs, with wages going up, and you have democrats over here. iowa, they can't even count the votes. now it looks like they can't even pick a nominee.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: but how is that even comparable? all right, so you have a problem in iowa. it's not the same as the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "pinion: well, i mean, again, i think that's the point, though.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we're over here running the country, and they're over here not even being able to take care of basic political business.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: what is their biggest worry right now? it always seems to me it could be bloomberg. it was once biden, because they really are pushing bernie very hard.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "pinion: well, look, i think -- again, i think republicans have to be careful what we wish for. again, i think that when you look at somebody like bernie, all the symptoms and signs are there for the same things that people said about president trump, that he's only getting 30 percent of the vote, that there are more people voting for somebody...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: you know who the first person to remind me of that was you.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: no, seriously, be careful jumping the gun on it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, i guess, kelly jane, what i'm looking at here is maybe a snapshot where it could be like a prize fight tonight. i don't -- sometimes they never live up to those expectations.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what do you think they're going to try to do to bloomberg?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kelly jane torrance, new york post: i think it's very interesting that people have been talking for years about how there's this battle for the heart and soul of the republican party with donald trump and what happened.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: there's always a battle going on for the heart and soul of parties, though, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, right now, the two front-runners apparently are people who aren't even democrats until very recently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think that we're seeing a lot of what they're going to bring up about mike bloomberg with all of the different audio that's been leaking on stop and frisk, on women, on people in the workplace.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: have any of those been reflected in these polls that show him rising? or is lot of that polling done prior to the release of these tapes?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "torrance: i think most of it is done prior to the release.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think also, though, i mean, stop and frisk, what he said on the tape was pretty awful. but people have known that he's been for that. and i think a lot of democrats have already been worried about how he's going to respond to that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he apologized for it when he got into the race. but, for many, it wasn't enough. and let's face it. joe biden really needs something tonight, but he has never performed that well in any of the debates. and, in fact, most people who have done well in the debates did so when they were targeting biden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm thinking of kamala harris, of course, on the busing thing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: that worked out like a charm, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "torrance: temporarily. i mean, biden's still going. she's out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, i say don't count him out. but, at the same time, right now, mayor pete buttigieg is the one, of course, who has the most delegates. but nobody seems to think he can keep taking it in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, again, don't count him out. everybody was surprised by his strong showing in iowa.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, with the focus right now on bloomberg tonight, he might regret accepting the invitation. right? or does he -- because it's been so widely telegraphed that he's going to be a pinata, what?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wolf: i mean, you and i spoke about it the other night. we thought that his best possibility was don't go to the debate.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but now i think we're at a point where he's had so many ads. you got to bring oz behind -- in front of the curtain, all right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wolf: i mean, we used to say with president obama, you know what, get in front of the rope line, not behind the rope line.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he has to start getting out and making sure people know what he stands for.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: and bloomberg is better than people think.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i know he has this intellectual approach to everything and sort of non- emotional. but he got elected three times in this city.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wolf: and it's not a debate. right? i mean, it's question and answer.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "pinion: look, i mean, i think you look at somebody like bloomberg, i mean, to me, i mean, there is a danger. i think somebody should still try to convince him not to go.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's running the best funded art project in the history of american politics. and right now, he's basically the quarterback that held out of training camp, and he's showing up in the middle of the season, and everyone else is in midseason form.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so amy klobuchar is champing at the bit. you have individuals right now who are going to try to characterize him in ways that...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wolf: i know a bunch of democratic strategists that will hire you right now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: he's been very prescient on a couple of key developments here very, very early on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: so, when you look at this and the media story, how is the media going to cover tonight?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they're going to be looking to see if bloomberg stumbles badly, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i mean, all eyes are on him. and i have to say, i'm interested to see which candidates really go after him. we know elizabeth warren already has on twitter calling him an egotistical billionaire like donald trump, she said.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but how hard are they going to hit him?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: how is he going to respond to that? what did she again? like...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's -- i think you have to worry about egging and being condescending. secondly, how hard are they going to go after him, when they all want his money? even bernie sanders didn't say that he wouldn't take that $2 billion that bloomberg is promising to spend, no matter who wins.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: yes. we will see. we will see. they have to make nice for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all right. they can't go too far. we will watch it later on.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, just to let you know, again, for those of you just tuning in, we hit some records today at corner of wall and broad. i'm sure the democrats will be mentioning this tonight, nasdaq and the s&p at new highs, the dow getting closer and closer to one.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but are the candidates in tonight's debate really promising to deliver something very different, something that has nothing to do with those market numbers?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right, well, they hike, and the strong economy just takes a hike -- that is kind of the message behind the trump campaign in the las vegas review-journal, slamming the democratic rivals over their tax plans, which to a man or woman, mean at least trillions of dollars more in taxes over the next 10 years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the only differentiator is how many trillions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vince coglianese is with us, susan li. we got scott martin.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "you know what's interesting, scott, about the way the president's positioning it, whatever you think of me, maybe whatever you think of my tweeting or whatever, take a look around you. take a look at this strong economy. and just go with that. what do you think?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "scott martin, kingsview asset management: i love it. and he's right.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it kind of is one of those situations, neil, where the numbers and the results are speaking for themselves, not these grandiose, hopeful plans of how things are going to work out so great for everybody, when we all know, i mean, in economics, there are winners and there are losers, not everybody wins, but people strive to win.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and that's really the key behind a lot of the policies that trump has introduced. and i think you just look around the democratic side of things. we're going to learn more tonight. i mean, mike bloomberg alone on wall street, a major beneficiary of wall street, he was, and now he's got all these ideas that seemingly are going to take down wall street and penalize wall street for being as successful as it has been over the years.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: susan, the big drive for democrats is, find us a winner. find us someone who can beat donald trump. so they kind of put their passions aside in favor the candidate who can most and likely will embody that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they're not quite sure about bloomberg. how is that going down?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "susan li, fox news correspondent: well, on wall street, people are a little bit surprised, because, as joe biden pointed out, bloomberg has been a republican most of his life, meaning that he's a proponent of capitalism, lower taxes, less regulation, the trickle-down wealth effect, and now he's talking about a transaction tax on wall street, expanding the volker rule, meaning more oversight for the banks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and this is counter to what he said 10 years ago, so they're hoping that maybe this is just before the primaries and he will move closer to the middle when the general election comes around, if he's still around.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: how do you think it's going to go for him, vince, on that idea? i mean, bloomberg is moderate in terms of some of the other candidates.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i think his costs are a few trillion dollars over 10 years, with wall street transaction taxes and the like, higher taxes on the upper income, but they're all going to raise taxes. so how does bloomberg try to differentiate himself? or can he?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "vince coglianese, the daily caller: yes, i don't think he's going to satisfy the left-wing base at all with these policy positions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "even announcing tax raises of any kind on wall street, it's going to fall on deaf ears, because he's a -- he's not a credible communicator on that subject. he is seen in the democratic party as a guy who got filthy rich off of the finance industry.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and the big problem for him is convincing democrats that he in any way deserves to be a part of this race, when the dnc clearly rolled out the red carpet and the velvet rope line for a guy who didn't even participate in the two first contests in this democratic primary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's what he needs to overcome. saying anything about going after wall street, it's going to fall on deaf ears.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right, the president is fine with continuing to quote the markets and what they're doing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "scott, it's something that's very, very important to him. it's hard to gauge where these markets go the rest of the year and all of that, but normally, normally they're kind of indicative of what's happening in the economy.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all seems pretty stable right now, the coronavirus uncertainties notwithstanding. will that continue to be the wind at his back?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, you make a good point, neil. things seem eerily ok, don't they? and this is after a lot of things that this market and economy have had thrown at it. i mean, tariff wars alone, the federal reserve just about a year or so ago that was hiking rates, instead of cutting them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, yes, overall, i think the economy has the wind at its back. and i think one reason we're seeing these record highs day after day, and we're going to see him probably tomorrow, too, after tonight's debate, you're going to see the democrats continue to fray, and that's why the markets like it, because it gives trump a better chance in november to pull this out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: susan, when you talk to traders, what's their biggest worry like these days?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: i'm sure it's not a focus on the campaign. i'm sure it's the virus, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, goldman sachs just came out with a note saying that the market isn't really accounting for how big of an impact coronavirus might have, especially when you have china talking about an economic crisis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "that's where they're equating the epidemic to at this point. there are some concerns that people are not really pricing that in properly, with these record markets still.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: when you talk about record markets, and you talk about michael bloomberg being front and center, he's mr. market, he's mr. wall street.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, of course, he made the terminals that became ubiquitous and made him a guy worth $60 billion-plus.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, vince, how does he handle that? because he could end up sounding an awful lot like the president talking about wall street.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and he is transparently an oligarch. the dictionary definition is a guy who uses his financial resources to control political conversations, and that's what he's doing around the country.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in fact, tonight's debate will be interesting, because this is a liability for him. this is an opportunity for him to actually have to answer questions, instead of controlling the airtime that he has by way of the many ads that he's purchased literally everywhere.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i feel like when i go to sleep at night, my dreams just start with a mike bloomberg ad. he's done everything.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and that was the only sign she has had. and then she's been testing negative since she got to the hospital that she's in, fukushima, japan.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so what we're understanding, after talking to doctors here, is that you're either one and done where it shows up and you have no symptoms, or, like carl, who had underlining symptoms -- he has guillain-barre syndrome.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so his immune system was already compromised. and that's why he has had a temperature a couple times.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: well, i hope he's going to be ok.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i mean, how are you holding up just with the meals and the difference on the ship? i mean, they're delivered to you. you're locked in that room. doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "and my best to your husband. you're a trooper. you both are.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "howard kurtz, host, media buzz: thanks.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: is that normally presidents of all party types do this more near the end of their term, in the case of bill clinton, a busy final few hours of his term.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but this president has been consistently doing these in spurts and in waves. i don't know what the issue is with that. he can do and pardon and commute to -- anyone who wants.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it gets an unusual amount of press. what do you think of it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: well, this is an action by the president that is causing him to be absolutely denounced by the media.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and i understand this part about blago, because, as you say, even some conservatives and republicans are upset about this.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "rod blagojevich is the guy who not only sold barack obama's senate seat, famously caught saying it was blanking golden.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: but he shook down a children's hospital for a $50,000 donation in exchange for millions in state funding, and never showed a smidgen of remorse.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but this has been portrayed by many in the media, neil, as a dark, nefarious trumpian assault on the criminal justice system, rather than controversial moves in the constitution similar to those of other past presidents.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: and what's interesting about it, you can argue whether the term that he was given, up to 14 years, was justified.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: but many have looked at that and said, all right, for the crimes, it doesn't fit, and it hearkens back to something the media seizes on, the time that the judge might want to slap roger stone, a person that got prosecutors looking at a higher number.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president obviously looking for a lower number. what do you make of that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: well, i make of that that, obviously, the president is not shy about intervening, whether it's twitter or talking to reporters, about people who are sometimes friends of his or former associates like roger stone, who thinks have been treated unfairly.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the reason that the press is connecting these pardons and commutations, not just the stone case, but saying that trump is -- he now says he's the nation's chief law enforcement officer -- is because of the washington post story saying that bill barr's threatened or at least has told people he might resign as attorney general if the president doesn't stop the tweets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: and the president is not stopping the tweets about the stone case.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right, so what happens if barr were to resign? then, all of a sudden, the narrative becomes there's a palace revolt, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: right, but probably the justice department would be without a head for the remaining time in this election year, and then some people will be nostalgic for bill barr.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "suddenly, all the people on the left who have been attacking barr since the day he took office would be saying, oh, he was a man of great principle, he's our new hero, he's the new mitt romney and all that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but you got to look back. i mean, bill clinton pardoned his half-brother. he pardoned marc rich, who was a fugitive who had fled the country. george h.w. bush pardoned caspar weinberger in the iran-contra scandal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and barack obama commuted the sentence of chelsea manning, who had endanger american lives...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: ... by dumping a ton of classified military secrets out there.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i wish that this president and the others had just gone through the normal justice department system, rather than, in this case, the president relying on friends and family and allies. but he does have the power to do that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: you know, the president is going, with this big fund-raiser with larry ellison, there are thousands of oracle workers who were very annoyed about it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i don't remember this kind of a big stink when other ceos have given to barack obama or whatever. they can do what they want to do, but what do you make of the dust-up over that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: i think it's hypocritical, because, obviously, president obama, other democrats have held fund-raisers or used the homes of rich guys, ceos, people who run companies.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "kurtz: and if most of the employees were all with it, even those who might have been conservative republican, you didn't have this big stink.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but somehow the employees of a big tech company like that feel like it's a personal affront that their ceo happens to support president trump. and, of course, the press just loves to jump on that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "all right, howie, thank you very much. good having you, my friend.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: that -- we told you about that larry ellison event.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "by the way, larry ellison is even richer than michael bloomberg. he's worth about $69 billion, michael bloomberg about $60 billion.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but it's that kowtowing and that relationship that gets a lot of attention. should it?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(commercial break) cavuto: well, president trump greeted by protesters in rancho mirage, california, today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president there for a fund-raiser with oracle founder larry ellison. some oracle employees, in fact, thousands of them, not too happy about that visit.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hillary vaughn in rancho mirage with more -- hillary.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hillary vaughn, fox news correspondent: hey, neil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, palm springs is called the president's playground for its history of attracting high-profile politicians to high-dollar fund-raisers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and, today, it was the scene for president trump's latest campaign cash haul at ellison's invite-only golf resort porcupine creek. this ritzy rendezvous in rancho mirage comes at an opportune moment for the oracle founder, because his company is challenging amazon in court over the bidding process for a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the pentagon that they ended up losing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, today, ellison got some valuable face time in with president trump, along with donors, some who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to golf with the president.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tickets for two starting at $100,000 for a tee-off with trump. supporters who shelled out over a quarter-of-a-million dollars got to have some alone time with the president at a roundtable. ellison has hosted other presidents at his exclusive resort here in rancho mirage.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but this was unique because it sparked a revolt at his own company; 5,000 oracle employees signed a petition trying to stop this fund-raiser from happening, and several of them logged off and walked out of work today in protest -- neil.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right, hillary, thank you very, very much.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "speaking about support that hillary just raised, we're learning now from politico that casino mogul sheldon adelson is throwing his financial weight and support behind the president's reelection campaign.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he's a multibillionaire, probably one of the republican party's most prolific givers. he's going to be holding a march 12 fund-raiser for the president at his las vegas home. it's apparently a very big home, so they can invite a lot of people.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "meanwhile, another royal pain for harry and meghan. let's just say they have a brand new problem.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "see what i did there? it's about the brand.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right, we're told that prince harry and meghan markle are announcing their royal duties will officially end come march 31.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "now, this amid reports queen elizabeth herself took those duties away by saying the sussex royal title that goes with their names will no longer go with it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i have no idea what that means. but i know one of my favorite guests on this subject does. she is an encyclopedia on all things royal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what does this mean, that they can't use the royal what?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "charlie lankston, editor, daily mail: yes, so they have basically brown branded themselves as sussex royal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "it is the name of their very popular instagram account and it's also the name that they wanted to use for their business ventures. so we know that they trademarked sussex royal for everything, from bandanas to notebooks. it's also what they wanted to call their charity venture.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, effectively, it was their business. it was going to be that brand. and the queen has now said, no, absolutely not. you will not be...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: so, she personally made that decision?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: she personally, yes -- well, she will have had advisement from people within buckingham palace.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: but, yes, she is the one who has said....", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: boy, you don't mess with the queen, do you. yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: absolutely not. she's a very foreboding lady. you do not mess with her.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "does any royalty attach itself to their names though? i mean, how big a deal is that? all right. we know your royalty, though, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, if you think about it, william and kate's instagram account is kensington royal. so harry and meghan kind of followed that pattern, but no other royal has tried to create a personal brand for themselves. they haven't needed to.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: do you need that name, that label to profit off?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: i don't think you need it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think, for harry and meghan, it's a bit of a kick in the teeth, because they have invested a lot of time, a lot of money, tens of thousands of dollars in creating a very shiny new web site, in trademarking sussex royal with all of these different products.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and they now effectively have to go back to square one as far as creating a personal brand for themselves, so that they can gain financial independence, which is what they were so keen to do when they split from the royal family.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: are they going to be worth more money or make more money in this role than as full-time royals?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: i mean, yes, we understand that they -- we're talking obama levels of finance here. they could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, if they capitalize on everything.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: book deals, private speaking engagements, which they have already done, potential production deals with companies like netflix, with apple tv.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: and then they also have the opportunity to kind of release merchandise, like they're talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i can't imagine how many people would actually buy a hoodie that says sussex royal or whatever it is that they end up putting on their merchandise in the future.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: but does their flame ever fizzle out a little bit?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "if they're out of the public eye -- and i guess you were reminding me they will always be in the public eye -- but do they lose their allure the longer they're away from the throne?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: i think they're playing it very well, in that they're teasing the public.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "yes, they have retired from kind of public life, as it were. but we see glimpses of them every now and then. we had photos of harry stopping by the grocery store to pick up his lunch today.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: by the way, that was so staged. stop. just stop.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: yes, i can't imagine -- yes, i can't imagine that he didn't think that there would be photographers.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: right. did he money with him to pay for it? because i didn't...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: he had staff with him. so i think -- i mean, if it was me...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: ... in the grocery store, i would have said, the sandwich is free.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: you take it, prince harry. it's all on you. you aren't earning money anymore. so, here, have a sandwich.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right, so they're going to do well.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "where are they going to settle? canada? what is that?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: so, right now, they're in vancouver on the very exclusive vancouver island.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they have been looking at properties there to buy, because they're currently renting. but they have also been looking at properties in malibu and new york, our sources tell us.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: now, obviously, her family is in california.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think, if she wanted to get back into that celebrity lifestyle, california would make sense. but who knows? right now, they aren't making any promises. but they still have four more official royal engagements in the u.k.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: so, they go back to...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: they will stay at frogmore cottage, their home that they still have.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: that is the one that looks like hogwarts, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: yes, exactly, the stunning property.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: so, they still have that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: it is stunning. and they had the whole thing redecorated and done for them.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: they did, but they have had to pay that money back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: so they have technically paid for these amazing refurbishments.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so they now get to put them to full use whenever they're in the u.k.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: so, how do brits feel about all this? i mean, they're like, a finger to the homeland. right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: absolutely. people are applauding the queen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: there were tweets the wazoo, people saying, well done, they should lose their royal titles. they're no longer members of the royal family.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: and a lot of people are actually delighting in poking a bit of fun at them and kind of saying, like, well, you wanted to put sussex royal on a pair of underpants. sorry, you can't do that anymore.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: yes, yes. regular pants maybe.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: regular pants, yes, down the side.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: so, the brothers, are they getting along? or are they fighting?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: they're doing better than they were.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: i don't think that their relationship has gone back to the closeness that it once was, but they are speaking. they are communicating.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and william is supporting harry in this new lifestyle that he's trying to pursue.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: that sounds like they're not getting along.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: i mean, i don't think they're as close as they once were, which is a shame.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right. that was very judiciously put.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "charlie, you are the best at this. thank you very much for taking the time.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "lankston: thank you for having me.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: a lot more on this and the ramifications of a bigger issue here at home when we come back.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "(commercial break) cavuto: all right, looking live in vegas, baby.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the democratic candidates will pitch their plans just a few days ahead of the nevada caucuses, which wrap up on saturday.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what's interesting here for republicans who say democrats are just wasting their time, they hope to succeed on issues like health care, which galvanize their takeover of the house in the midterms. they think it can repeat here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "beverly hallberg joins us, the independent women's forum, and jason nichols, the democratic strategist.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "beverly, the one thing you hear is that health care worked for us. it wasn't a wedge issue. it became the issue. and so, this way, we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about the jobs gains and everything else going on in the trump economy. they're noteworthy. they're hard to argue again. so we're going to focus on this stuff, and maybe do better.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "beverly hallberg, independent women's forum: yes.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "well, i think health care is becoming that economic issue, because what voters really care about is for their costs to go down in health care. i thought it was very fascinating this week, when bernie sanders went around touting his medicare for all plan, that even the culinary union said they weren't going to endorse him and even said, we like our health care, and we don't want you to take it away.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so i do expect, on the debate stage tonight, in addition to the billionaire bloomberg bashing that is going to be an abundance, for them to talk about, some of the so-called moderates to talk about their alternative to medicare for all. this is what amy klobuchar is talking about.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, regardless, republicans are going to have to start talking about their plans for health care moving forward.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: another thing that's interesting, jason, from the democratic perspective -- you're the expert here -- that the idea that michael bloomberg has not to really pick apart the economy and the numbers and the jobs gains and the markets, but to talk about, with that success and the money you can raise from these who've done very well, to get to these other goals.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how is that going to go?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "jason nichols, democratic strategist: well, i think bloomberg is going to struggle tonight.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he has a whole lot to answer for, as we know, with so many issues in terms of stop and frisk. and one of the things that he's got to argue on super tuesday coming up is to convince african-american voters that he's on their side.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it's going to be very difficult, when you recently said that you supported redlining, which basically destroyed african-american wealth. and then you say, ok, well, i have got a plan for that.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think that it's going to ring hollow for him. but i think health care is a winning issue for democrats across the board. we know that the president's handling of health care, he's at about 30 -- in the 30 percentile area in terms of approval for the way he's handled health care.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we know he's supported federal lawsuits that basically will take away protections for preexisting conditions.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: no, you raise a good point about how this could all sort out.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i wonder, beverly, if there will be a limit to how aggressively they go after bloomberg. after all, this is the same guy who has promised to write a check to help the nominee, to help the party. they don't want to go too far, right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "hallberg: he's bought a lot of influence over the years, not just with local communities across this country, but some of those individuals he's going to be debating.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what is fascinating is, his team has already come out and said that this isn't his forte. he's not great at public speaking. so they're already downplaying the expectations just a little bit. so, hopefully -- they're hoping, even if he doesn't have a super strong showing, it won't hurt him too badly in the polls.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but, from a messaging standpoint, i do think he needs to be on that more moderate level. but he is going to be attacked tonight, because he has been gaining in the polls.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: no, i think you're right. and keep the expectations low.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on that, jason, i built a career on it. so maybe he should try.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how do you think it ends up tonight? i mean, they're fighting with each other, screaming at each other. they just endured the iowa craziness and all. how are democrats feeling?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nichols: i think people are feeling optimistic.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i think some people are a little worried that bloomberg is going to buy this thing. but i think, bernie...", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: well, if he did, would they support him? in the end, would they live with that if he were the nominee and support him?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nichols: i think that there would be an exodus of bernie sanders supporters, people who wanted to see bernie sanders, especially if he has the most delegates and the most votes at the end of the primary season.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: but most doesn't mean a majority. right? you have to get that 1,991. if he doesn't have that, it's not a birthright. right?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "nichols: it's not a birthright. but, still, in elections, the people who have the most votes should win.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and it seems like most of the party, i think, would support bernie sanders over somebody like mike bloomberg, who's really just pumping money into it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "cavuto: all right, we will see. it's still early in the going. that's a whole 'nother show, a whole 'nother discussion.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but mexico and china are also linked to the deaths of americans. each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. so, does that mean we get to bomb oaxaca? can we start assassinating generals in the people's liberation army? maybe. maybe ben sasse will call for that, too. he's a former consultant and a very tough character. but before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the united states richer and more secure. there are an awful lot of bad people in this world. we can't kill them all. it's not our job. instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of american citizens. period. that's why we have a government. so, has the killing of soleimani done that? maybe. no one in washington has explained how. instead, like ben sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. he clearly was. so? that's irrelevant. meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. we're praying they don't, but they could. how do we know that? because we've seen it before. we fought quite a number of wars around the middle east in recent decades. we attacked saddam hussein twice, as you know. in the end we killed him. we invaded an occupied afghanistan. we toppled moammar gaddafi in libya.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we fought isis in syria and then for some reason stuck around. we're still there. we joined humanitarian missions in lebanon and somalia. our special forces have been quietly fighting in yemen, pakistan, niger, who knows where all else. many other places. in every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. the benefits? often, they've been non-existent. a lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. certainly, they did. hope that makes you feel better. what do the american people think about all of this? not that anyone cares. well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. the killing of soleimani happened just last night. but just five months ago after months of supposed iranian provocation. american's didn't seem to view iran as a major concern, not even close. in a gallop poll taken last august, just 18 percent of americans said that they backed military force to shut down iran's nuclear program. seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. so, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual americans don't enter the equation at all. they're immaterial. in 2016, donald trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well. he vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home, which are growing.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "against the odds he won that election, probably because of that promise, but ever since washington, including some around the president, have been committed to ignoring the results of that election and its implications. washington has wanted war with iran for decades. they've been working toward it. they may have finally gotten it. douglas macgregor is a retired u.s. army colonel. he's an author of the fantastic book, margin of victory, a frequent guest on this show and he joins us tonight. colonel, thanks so much for coming on. where do you think we're likely to go from here?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "douglas macgregor: well, i'm told that tomorrow the iraqi parliament is going to vote overwhelmingly to demand the removal of our forces from iraq. if that's the case i sincerely hope that president trump will take advantage of it and get us out. we should've been out of iraq and syria a long time ago as the president pointed out, as you have reiterated. we gain nothing by staying in the country whatsoever. if these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. but if we are going to fight the iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. as for the active killing soleimani, i think we can say with some certainty that iran will respond. probably not in the way that we would. the iranians are not like us. they do not emote. you've been listening to people emote about how much they hate soleimani and blame the failure in iraq on soleimani. that's nonsense. we failed in iraq. the generals and the politicians are responsible for the loss of american life and the squandering of our opportunities in iraq. soleimani simply took advantage of it and iran now controls iraq.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "and after this airstrike and killing of soleimani, we've actually forced them together because the people of iraq may not like the iranians, but they don't necessarily want their country turned into a battleground between the united states and iran. so, i hope we'll just leave. that's the key. if we get out, then we're going to have to watch for what the iranians are likely to do, and we can talk about that if you like.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tucker carlson: my sense, my strong sense is that the president's preference is to leave, that it's always been that he's sincere when he says he doesn't want regime change and he's not trying to start any wars. he understands that those are not in america's interest and they're not in his interest either politically. i'm wondering, though, if the people around him understand that.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "johnny joey jones: well, i think it's impossible to separate the emotional appeal of killing someone who deserved to die and the overall strategic kind of cautionary tale of what are we going to do next? you know, i wrote for foxnews.com today that the tactical decision to send troops into iraq that i was a part of, the troop surge got the al-qaida out of al anbar, but would we do next? what was the strategic goal after that? same thing, i was a part of a troop surge in afghanistan when i lost my legs. we got the taliban out of the poppy fields, away from the opium trade, but what did we do the next day? and that was the problem, and i think a lot of this is that politicians that hold each other accountable, they throw each other under the bus. so, when we change presidents, sometimes we change policy for that purpose -- so that we can be a contrast, not necessarily more right or more wrong. and so, it's not so much that i take issue or really have an opinion over killing this guy yesterday. it's what are we doing next? what is the strategy, not the tactical, what did in this one operation, but what's the overall point here?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jim antle: -- campaigned on the idea that we were going to shrink our footprint in the middle east. i think that's what he'd like to do. i think he's trying to balance the fact that he would like to do that with the desire to be tough. the desire to protect american personnel that are still in the region, but he has a lot of advisers who are committed to the things that he ran against. he has a lot of george w. bush retreads who are giving him advice on what to do with iraq and with iran, and the danger is that once you've done some of these things, once you've committed to some of these moves, you're going to draw more troops in rather than drawing down, as i think the president would prefer to do -- that there is no easy exit strategy; that there is no easy way out. so, the hope is that this strike is going to cripple iran's capacity to be able to threaten our people. we can move on, and if iraq does, in fact, decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, as was always likely once we put a shiite government in charge of iraq, that they were going to be friendlier to iran than washington was ever going to prefer, that we use that as a reason to get out, having accomplished everything that we're going to accomplish there.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "jim antle: right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. and so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in afghanistan and syria, and the vast majority of republican senators voted to rebuke him. and in the case of syria, we're talking about a war that congress never voted to authorize in the first place. well, here we are in iraq, and we have most republican senators saying that they don't want congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. i think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of cold war 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped trump win in 2016.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "j.d. vance: well, i think for a couple of reasons. one, we have an entire generation of american intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the middle east was just the most important region of the world. and so, one way of thinking about american policy really for the past 20 years, the george w. bush administration, of course the barack obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. we basically had one new war per term, iraq, and then -- excuse me, afghanistan, then iraq, lebanon and syria during the obama terms and that's obviously terrible and i think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for america's national interest but viewed from the chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for america's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that china was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. i think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the american foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "tucker carlson: i mean, just a macro question to end on. why is it so hard for our elites to police themselves? if someone is consistently wrong about the big things, why is he still in the same job? if we allowed our heart surgeons to keep working with that kind of track record no one would survive surgeries. so, why do we allow our policymakers to be wrong time and again?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "j.d. vance: well, tucker, i'll give you a cynical answer and then a less cynical answer. i mean, the less cynical answer is basically that a lot of people just aren't very good and very smart at what they do and honestly i actually hope that's the answer because the more cynical answer is that as our country has successfully bungled or sorry successively bungled middle eastern wars and allowed china to rise, there is of course a group of people who've gotten very wealthy off of china's growing power and that's the financial elites who actually run the country who donate to the think tanks of course that produce the policy papers that so many of our politicians rely on and so i do think that one way of recognizing that there's been a massive failure here is that the people who have not been in service of the american national interests are still collecting a paycheck and the people who have gotten it right are still largely on the fringes and i think that's fundamentally a story of incentives and a story of who donors are benefiting from and who donors are paying to effectively issue what is propaganda.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "dana loesch: no, i agree with you, tucker. and thanks for having me. i find it horrifying that anyone at usa today would actually find it horrifying to save lives, to defend innocent people, because that's exactly what happened. i was also, and the reason to remind everyone that we have this video to go by, is because sadly, the church was live streaming their service that sunday morning, as they always do, and it ultimately was captured. but you see in that video, tucker, there are about five other law-abiding individuals who also draw their weapons, which is probably what would happen at my church. and i'm one of the law-abiding people who carry in my church, and we are encouraged to do so. but five other people also drew their lawfully carried, lawfully owned firearms, and they held. they watched and waited and took in everything that was happening before then, which indicates a level of training and a skillset that shouldn't horrify people. in fact, it should encourage individuals, because we were always told that if there is more than one firearm present in an area such as this, that there's a mass casualty incident or someone armed comes in to do murderous intent, that it would turn into the wild west. well, it didn't. it took jack harris one shot and six seconds to neutralize this threat. god bless them and god bless texas.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "dana loesch: well, and it's -- yeah. and it's anti-science. you know, when you talk about castro and beto o'rourke and michael bloomberg and all of these other individuals that want to circumvent our second amendment rights, when they talk about criminal usage, we can't have a conversation about firearms unless we are also including, tucker, defensive gun usages. these are individuals who are in lawful possession of their firearms. and these numbers – defensive gun usage is, according to the cdc from barack obama when he commissioned this in 2013. it has therefore, it's -- i mean, it's been affirmed many times over, as you know, that they vastly outweigh instances of criminal possession. so, why -- my actual fear is that people find this bad, that there are good people out there who take the time to educate themselves, to learn about their firearm and to train, as we saw all those congregants at the church do just a week or so ago with jack harris. and then jack harris probably trained some of them as well. now, that's -- people should want to be able, they should be able to defend themselves. and we should encourage and empower people to do so instead of trying to shame them or smear them or malign their character. i find that disturbing.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "tucker carlson: well, if you can remember that far back during president barack obama's second term, republican leaders in the congress made a big show of opposing the obama administration's refugee policy. obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled syria's civil war in the united states and at the time 25 republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. for example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. often, it's impossible. some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be syrian. that was true for sure in europe with the refugees. some of them might be islamic extremists. but terrorism was not the only worry they had. america's middle class is in decline. we already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. the last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. that's just true. and anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. as with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. so, before she became the most anti-american member of congress, ilhan omar was a refugee. so, at the time the republican governors got their wish and president trump won the 2016 election.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "tucker carlson: thank you. for more than 100 years the boeing company has led international aviation. to this day it's measured by dollar amounts. boeing remains america's single largest foreign exporter. but now like so many american institutions, boeing is in trouble. last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. there's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. production is being suspended. in business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. how did it happen? well, at least part of the responsibility lies with ceo dennis muilenburg who has been in charge at boeing since 2015. fittingly, muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. someone in corporate america is finally being held accountable for screwing up. but before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. according to recent sec filings, muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. that's his punishment. and by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. here's some context for how much money that is. a rank and file employee at boeing might make $60,000 a year. that's a decent salary in many places. it would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced dennis muilenburg is getting in his severance package.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "in other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 american households. and if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. since 1978 ceo salaries in america's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. in 1965, ceos in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. as recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. no wonder people are sending money to bernie sanders. that's what happens when you abuse the system. you discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. in europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. airbus ceo tom enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. that's a lot, but it was half as much as boeing's dennis muilenburg made, and airbus planes didn't even crash. this is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. it's dangerous for our country. why? well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like dennis muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. attitudes are changing fast.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "when we felt it was the right thing to do, consistent with our", "augmented": []}

{"original": "held up by the senate. but she negotiated with secretary mnuchin and", "augmented": []}
{"original": "senator mcconnell for that original stimulus deal.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so people looking at that scratch their heads.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "guy benson of fox news radio; charles lane from the washington post; former dnc chair, donna brazile; and former trump national security council spokesman michael anton.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "should the president listen to bill barr, will he listen to bill barr?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "michael anton, former national security council spokesman: well, look, i think he should listen to bill barr. the president obviously has confidence in bill barr. he appointed him.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "he has said over the weekend that, you know, he was asked, does this mean there's a rift? would seem that he had a rift with his prior attorney general and he said, no. so, i think he should listen.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but i think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. the president thinks andrew mccabe probably should have been charged and he thinks roger stone is getting railroaded. if he were really intervening, the charges against roger stone would have been dropped and andrew mccabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, i take bill barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. but the fact of the matter is i think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: good luck with getting him to back off on the tweets.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of democratic calls to investigate political interference at the department of justice, we got this on facebook from mark davis.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "how can you interfere in an organization you oversee? it's rhetorical. you can't.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chuck, as i discussed with kellyanne, under article two, the president has tremendous powers to oversee the justice department and specifically criminal investigations. so how do you answer mark?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "chuck lane, the washington post: it's a fair question. there is a paradox built into our constitutional order.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "the president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. and that's why since watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the justice department. and broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "here we have a president who doesn't really i think even know about it, and flouts it through social media, broadcasting his desire to see this or that person benefited by justice, somebody else should go to jail, and that, as bill barr said is totally threatening to that norm.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but he does it because the base loves it. i'm not even sure he really wants these threats and orders carried out, but the base loves it and that is why he will keep doing it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: meanwhile, democrats are now calling for an investigation of attorney general barr. or even more. take a look.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "warren: what the attorney general has done, we should all be calling for the resignation of the attorney general. if he won't resign, remember, the attorney general can be impeached.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "in both instances, the communities erupted because they were concerned about overzealous policing and what happened in those cases. that's what they got involved.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "they didn't get in -- they didn't try to tip the scales of justice. they were trying to calm the community after, you know, two very horrific things occurred. so, we shouldn't put the two together.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "but the president's -- what he's doing with his tweets, he's revealing what's going on in the justice department. and i think the house should get to the bottom of it.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: guy, first of all, your reaction to donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general? or is it a bit of theater as some people have suggested, where barr is saying this because he needs to shore up his position at the justice department and there's kind of an inside agreement, tacit agreement between the white house and justice?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "guy benson, fox news radio: well, first, i would just say to donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. i would also note, that president obama did make public comments about the hillary clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from rodney king, right? so there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "on this broader issue of barr and the democratic reaction, i think your question was good. have the democrats learned their lesson? we have people talking about impeachment of bill barr, which i think is ludicrous.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "we have heard over and over again from democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to president trump? why won't any of his people stand up to president trump? then bill barr does that with a brush back pitch that i think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "i'm not sure i would call it a rift, but between bill barr saying what he said on abc news, and then his justice department declining to prosecute andrew mccabe, an outcome that i think it's very clear the president wants, to michael's point -- i think it's been about few days for the narrative that bill barr is just a hatchet man for president trump who will do his bidding.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: so what to expect? do you -- i mean, going forward you expect the president to stay out of these cases?", "augmented": []}
{"original": "benson: no, he'll tweet. there's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less. i think that mitch mcconnell sat in the studio, the senate majority leader, just a few days ago and urge the president to take the advice of his attorney general. i hope the president does it, even if he just calibrates it slightly differently.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "what will be interesting is if trump dials it up and continues to do this even more aggressively, what does barr do then? having lay down a marker on this point?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "what i will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. and when you look at the way that latino voters here in nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat donald trump. we are ready to go out and have that conversation.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. but we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. and it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "wallace: well, let me follow up on that because kellyanne conway was, i think, trolling democrats and saying, boy, this part that talks about all of these principles in the me too era, are they going to nominate somebody like michael bloomberg with his record of things he's done, for instance, towards women in the workplace, just because they think he can beat donald trump? what would that say about what the democratic party really stands for?", "augmented": []}

{"original": "guy benson, townhall.com: no, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the democratic party, right? here is a new york billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a democrat, and mike bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. all right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. that combination, is that going to sit well with the democratic electric? are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat president trump? that's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "wallace: then there is -- i guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, joe biden, who took it drubbing in iowa, an even worse drubbing in new hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, latinos, african-americans in south carolina and nevada, to -- to rescue him.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "michael anton, former national security council spokesman: well, the fundamental problem the democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. so it seems like all the energy on the basis is for bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.", "augmented": []}
{"original": "so that lane remains clogged up. i think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the democratic nomination. keep in mind that no mayor of new york city, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. not 1940, but 1840. so that sort of tells against mike bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- i don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. and even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think bernie's a disaster.", "augmented": []}

{"original": "but i do believe that we are going to see a clarifying moment that occurs over the next two weeks. and by the time we get to super tuesday -- i've been to four of the super tuesday states. let me just tell you, michael bloomberg is dominating the airwaves. but you're right, i don't know where the energy is on the ground for michael bloomberg, but he is dominating the airwaves.", "augmented": []}
