Now, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.
Jobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the Venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. Antonio Ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of Caracas and opposition leader now exiled in Spain, told Fox News more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.

Getting 8.3 million New York City residents organized to do anything is going to be hard. I'm struck by the lack of preparation. They could have foreseen the need for a registration system months ago. As it is, they seem to be managing things on the fly.
I talk to a lot of military members on a regular basis, Blackburn went on. They have a real problem with some of the things and the manner in which he conducted himself in this matter. What we want to do is make certain that we get to the heart of the issues here; we want to be certain the president is treated fairly. We want to make certain that we move through this and that we get back to the people's business, things they want to see us do, like putting more judges on the federal bench.
The senator's tweet referred to the vice president's now-debunked statement at the onset of the Iraq War in 2003 that Saddam Hussein's regime had weapons of mass destruction.

New York Assemblyman Ron Kim, who is the chairman of the Aging Committee tweeted in response to Stringer's tweet:
For U.S. flights, June 13 is the start of higher pre-summer fares, and peak season prices begin June 23. These high prices will generally remain in effect for U.S. travel through July. For Europe travel, the highest prices will be charged for flights in late June; fares actually drop a bit for July.
President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.

Both Facebook and Twitter locked Trump's account this week. While his Facebook page is expected to remain locked through President-Elect Joe Biden's inauguration, his Twitter feed was suspended on Friday night.
The president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:
GARLAND, JUDGE AND FAMED PROSECUTOR, TO LEAD DOJ
Cavuto: Coast to Coast, Noon ET: Anthony Chan, JP Morgan Chase chief economist.
Blackburn tweeted as Schiff spoke on Thursday evening: Adam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot. How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy? ... Alexander Vindman broke the chain of command and leaked the contents of the President's July 25th phone call to his pal, the 'whistleblower.' Over a policy dispute with the President! How is that not vindictive?
Long before the Supreme Court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA, that the EPA has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act, Browner (then EPA director under President Bill Clinton) had her general counsel, Jonathan Cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the EPA possessed such a power. At the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that Congress would never allow. Now it's happening, and Browner is right at the center of it.
Asked by CNN's Anderson Cooper this week whether he was unaware of the accusations, Sanders sarcastically replied: Uh, yes. I was a little bit busy running around the country, trying to make the case. He then appeared to smile.
On the roster: Pelosi: Will impeach if cabinet won't oust Trump - Garland, judge and famed prosecutor, to lead DOJ - 'Oh yeah, we can't have that'
The acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to Venezuelans, but to the region at large. The country is enduring a dire shortage of vaccinations and treatments for illnesses and diseases, prompting a concern that once eradicated conditions such as measles and diptheria are not only spreading in the financially depleted nation, but now threatens millions across Latin America.
The rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.
The ship with more than 2,000 people was currently near Ishigaki, one of Okinawa's outer islands, and was seeking another port, said Overseas Travel Agency official Mie Matsubara.

The Maduro regime has – for the most part – denied the existence of a major crisis in its country, instead blaming the US- and US-supported political foe for waging economic war.
It follows that divided government isn't good enough. In order for anything to be accomplished in Washington, and I mean anything, McConnell cannot remain in control.
Looking back, his professional sense of vigilance in particular is worthy of our respect, the paper said in an editorial.
At one point during his impeachment testimony last year, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with the NSC's Tim Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable. But, under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.
But Sanders' attack raised some eyebrows for associating the female lawmaker entirely with the failures of her father instead of responding to her actual critique.
Pressman added: That a member of the Senate – at a moment when the Senate is undertaking its most solemn responsibility – would choose to take to Twitter to spread slander about a member of the military is a testament to cowardice. While Senator Blackburn fires off defamatory tweets, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman will continue to do what he has always done: serve our country dutifully and with honor.
What has been shocking to me is I am seeing parallels to other places I have worked – Afghanistan and Mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. People have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. It is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the Venezuela crisis all the more important.
Response for Venezuelans, the coordination platform for refugees and migrants, documents at least 16 countries that now need assistance in tending to the ever-burgeoning mass migration flow.
The Writer's Almanac: On this date in 1610, Galileo wrote a letter describing his discovery of three of Jupiter's moons. He discovered them in December, after improving his telescope design. He wasn't sure at first they were moons; he thought they were fixed stars. He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers. Marius's names stuck, and today we know the moons as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
The boomerang came back to them. It was them that launched color revolutions. In fifty years they carried out three dozen, if not more, he said, according to the Moscow Times. They toppled the leaders in North Africa and Yugoslavia and ousted a normal government in Ukraine, they had a go at Belarus last year. Well, now they are paying for it.

Kennedy: Time for a new Trump game plan.
The migration in 2018 has been fast and fleeting. Ecuador, for one, went from seeing the entry of thirty to forty Venezuelans per month to a peak of around 90,000 in May this year. A second wave hit in October, and at least 70,000 a month have been entering since.
Left unchecked, Browner will move beyond automobiles to EPA's entire staggering 18,000-page blueprint for regulating the U.S. economy. It will eventually regulate everything that moves (light-duty trucks, heavy-duty trucks, buses, motorcycles, planes, trains, ships, boats, tractors, mining equipment, RVs, lawn mowers, fork lifts, and just about every other piece of equipment that has a motor) and lots of things that don't (any building over 100,000 square feet could be pulled in, along with smaller carbon dioxide emitters, like restaurants, schools, and hospitals that have commercial kitchens with gas burners).

TRUMP SLAMS HIS VP, SAYS PENCE 'DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE' TO DECERTIFY RESULTS OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
The theory that blames Ukraine for interfering in the 2016 elections is no laughing matter, Schiff said, calling it central to the impeachment charges. Trump is accused of seeking the Ukraine investigation — and a probe of Joe Biden and his son Hunter — for his own political benefit while holding back congressionally approved military aid as leverage.

He added that the U.S. and China have run into unprecedented difficulties in the past few years, and some American politicians see China as the United States' so-called biggest threat, leading them to base China policy on serious misconceptions.
And for that reason, they are squalid, dirty and dangerous places for vulnerable Venezuelans. Officials refer to those leaving Venezuela as being a mixed migration flow rather than refugees.
Ultimately, the buck stops with local governments who are then in-charge of tending to the minors, with local aid agencies doing their best to offer guidance and support to the already overwhelmed government bodies.

'The president is unfit, and the president is unwell,' Kinzinger said in a searing video posted to Twitter on Thursday, a day after thousands of rioters flocked to Washington, D.C., to stymie the vote to certify the Electoral College tally for President-elect Joe Biden. Pro-Trump supporters, encouraged by the president's rhetoric, stormed into the building, forcing lawmakers into hiding for hours. He called on Vice President Mike Pence and the majority of the Cabinet to use the Constitutional amendment to declare Trump unfit for office and 'ensure the next few weeks are safe for the American people.'

'I've known Mike Pence forever,' Inhofe said Tuesday night. 'I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today.' 'I had a long conversation with him,' said Inhofe. 'He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump).''

I think we're making an airtight case for anyone who's willing to listen, Nadler told Fox News. The evidence is overwhelming. The president's counsels have not offered any evidence against it, nor will they, because there is no possibility. And as I said the other day, or yesterday, watch what the president's counselors say.

Even the New York Times has been getting tough with its headlines on what was happening:
Well, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama.

'Orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress is inexcusable,' Barr said in a statement obtained by POLITICO. 'The President's conduct yesterday was a betrayal of his office and supporters.' Barr's criticism on Thursday was not his first public comment on the chaos at the Capitol. As the president's supporters breached the building on Wednesday afternoon, he released a statement through his spokesperson that did not refer to Trump by name.

President Trump is deranged, unhinged, dangerous, and deserving of prosecution, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says in an interview scheduled to air Sunday night on 60 Minutes.
A WARNING TO PELOSI AND HOUSE DEMS: Republican strategist Colin Reed says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats should not celebrate too long. They are about to be reminded that governing is a lot more difficult than making campaign promises - and Democrats are far from being united ... In an op-ed on FOXNews.com, Reed writes: House Democrats are about to find out that governing is harder than campaigning. Their majority is paved through 31 districts won by Trump in 2016 that flipped blue in 2018, many of which had resided in the GOP column for generations.
The White House and some congressional Republicans have raised questions about Hunter Biden's lucrative job on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company, and Joe Biden's successful efforts to force the firing of a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor. Biden was overseeing Ukraine policy as vice president while Hunter made big money in Ukraine, and Hunter got the job after testing positive for cocaine in the Navy Reserves.
President Trump's administration argued that the measures were an appropriate response to a system rife with abuse and overwhelmed with unworthy claims.

By contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.

In past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.

The rules would narrow the types of persecution and severity of threats for which asylum is granted. Applicants seeking protections on the basis of gender or those who claim they were targeted by gangs, rogue government officials or non-state organizations would likely not be eligible for asylum.
It would be bad enough if the acts of terrorism now being perpetrated by this mob were underway while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., banged her gavel and shut down any objections to Electoral College votes that many of my fellow Trump fans believe are tainted by ballot irregularities.

The government has recycled exactly the same legal and factual claims made in the prior cases, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts, Donato wrote. This is a troubling litigation strategy. In effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through.
There is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.

At the president's request, Pelosi and other congressional leaders are scheduled to return to the White House on Friday morning to resume talks to end the shutdown.
Add this to the list of the many mistakes the governor has made over the last 10 months, but won't answer for. He seemed to escape widespread criticism of his lethal executive order in March and the thousands of seniors who subsequently died. But maybe now people are taking notice:
If you ask those who lost loved ones in nursing homes, as my family did in 2020, his leadership has been a failure starting with his March 25 order to put COVID positive patients into nursing homes for 46 days, and the subsequent cover-up of the total number of seniors we've lost since then.
Consider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.

It first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, Todd Chapman, the U.S Ambassador to Ecuador, told Fox News. People don't leave their children behind because they want to. It is because of the dire circumstances on the ground in Venezuela are causing people to take this consequential and dangerous and desperate decision to seek a better life elsewhere.

Donato said his ruling applies nationwide because limiting its reach would result in a fragmented and disjointed patchwork of immigration policy.

Top officials leave over Trump misconduct - Fox News: With just two weeks left before the Trump administration vacates Washington D.C., some staffers are resigning in protest after demonstrations breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by protesters following a speech by President Trump. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, East Wing Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, and Social Secretary Rickie Niceta all submitted their resignations after pro-Trump supporters mobbed the U.S. Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. Late Thursday morning, a senior administration official told Fox News that Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, resigned Wednesday afternoon as a result of the president's actions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mick Mulvaney -- special envoy to Northern Ireland and President Trump's former chief of staff -- on Thursday also resigned, telling CNBC: 'I can't stay here.'

Other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.

Earlier in the day, Democrats were laughing along as Schiff joked that Trump had made a religious man out of Vladimir Putin,'' a reference to a comment by Putin last November: Thank God,'' he told an economic forum in Moscow, no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine.
She said she might have a glass of wine and take a bath tonight to relax. On Wednesday, Murkowski said she was offended when Democratic impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., tried to argue that senators would be participating in a coverup if they opposed Democrats' document requests -- an aggressive move that apparently backfired in the chamber, and led to a rare intervention from Chief Justice John Roberts.

Similarly, they argued that there was no truth to the theory pushed by Trump and his allies that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Although Democrats -- and some news outlets, including The Associated Press -- have repeatedly claimed that the idea of Ukraine meddling is a conspiracy theory, a Ukrainian court has ruled that officials in the country did illegally meddle in the U.S. election. Additionally, a 2017 investigative report by Politico found extensive efforts by Ukrainians to hurt Trump's presidential campaign.
Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., head of the Freedom Caucus, rose to state his concerns about his own state's Electoral College votes.

Biden reportedly will name R.I. governor to lead Commerce - WSJ: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo as his commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California economic development official, to lead the Small Business Administration, according to people familiar with the matter.

She also led the Democratic Governors Association from 2018 to 2019. Before she entered public service, Ms. Raimondo co-founded Point Judith Capital, a venture-capital firm. Ms. Guzman was a senior official at the SBA during the Obama administration, serving as deputy chief of staff. In 2019, she became the director of California's Office of the Small Business Advocate, where she helped implement a grant program for businesses affected by the pandemic.

The three-judge panel said Trump's executive order that required both state and local entities to give their consent before allowing refugees to be placed in their areas would undermine the 1980 Refugee Act.

Long before the Supreme Court ruled in a highly questionable 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA, that the EPA has the legal authority to justify its proposed 18,000 pages of greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act, Browner (then EPA director under President Bill Clinton) had her general counsel, Jonathan Cannon, prepare a now-infamous memorandum arguing�for the first time�that the EPA possessed such a power. At the time it was dismissed as a wild-eyed overreach that Congress would never allow. Now it's happening, and Browner is right at the center of it.
Abe said the new immigration policy takes effect Friday to ensure border control to prevent the disease from entering and spreading further into Japan.

Any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just Carol Browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.

It is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.

In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.

It's bad enough that the EPA is moving ahead with plans to pursue expensive global warming regulations instead of leaving the complex issue to Congress, the branch of government constitutionally tasked with making laws.

Ted Cruz, R-Texas.
[Ed. note: Antifa most certainly is bad. So is social isolation. So is the decline of the nation's spiritual health. So is the rise of negative partisanship. So is the dearth of local news coverage. There's so much that is bad in American public life these days. But what really saddens me are those who pretend Wednesday's ransacking was inevitable. Aside from excusing the conduct of the vandals and rioters, it suggests somehow that the case for America is hopeless. What a sad betrayal of the sacrifices made to provide the extraordinary opportunities we now enjoy. The doom caucus helped lead us here. It's time to start tuning them out.]
CHINA'S CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK KILLS 638, INFECTS MORE THAN 31,400 AS WORLD STRUGGLES FOR A CURE
A U.S. judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration's most sweeping set of asylum restrictions less than two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
It has been an epiphany for the world to see that there are people in our country led by this president, for the moment, who have chosen their Whiteness over democracy, Pelosi said, according to The Associated Press.
President Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.

DONNA BRAZILE: GOP SENATE CANDIDATES IN GEORGIA ARE TRUMP PUPPETS WHO ACT LIKE CONTESTANTS ON 'THE APPRENTICE'
Blackburn tweeted as Schiff spoke on Thursday evening: Adam Schiff is hailing Alexander Vindman as an American patriot. How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy? ... Alexander Vindman broke the chain of command and leaked the contents of the President's July 25th phone call to his pal, the 'whistleblower.' Over a policy dispute with the President!

If President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?
Three Republicans supported the Democrats' rules, including Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, and New York Reps. John Katko and Tom Reed. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and California Rep. Ro Khanna voted against the rules package.
ANALYST DISILLUSIONED WITH JOURNALISM AND 'TRUMP CIRCUS': Longtime military analyst William Arkin has stepped down from his role at NBC News with a scathing letter criticizing the current state of journalism as well as President Donald Trump ... Arkin, a U.S. Army veteran who has worked for NBC as a reporter and commentator over the course of three decades, wrote a 2,228-word internal memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday, declaring that the world and the current state of journalism have been in tandem crisis. My expertise, though seeming to be all the more central to the challenges and dangers we face, also seems to be less valued at the moment. And I find myself completely out of synch with the network, being neither a day-to-day reporter nor interested in the Trump circus, Arkin wrote. - Reported by Joseph A. Wulfsohn

4 DEAD, 52 ARRESTED AFTER CHAOS AT CAPITOL, DC POLICE SAY
In another CBS preview clip, Pelosi describes her experience inside the Capitol as protesters were gathering outside and then entering the building.
Top officials leave over Trump misconduct - Fox News: With just two weeks left before the Trump administration vacates Washington D.C., some staffers are resigning in protest after demonstrations breached the U.S. Capitol Wednesday by protesters following a speech by President Trump. White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews, East Wing Chief of Staff Stephanie Grisham, and Social Secretary Rickie Niceta all submitted their resignations after pro-Trump supporters mobbed the U.S. Capitol building to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. Late Thursday morning, a senior administration official told Fox News that Matt Pottinger, deputy national security adviser, resigned Wednesday afternoon as a result of the president's actions and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Mick Mulvaney -- special envoy to Northern Ireland and President Trump's former chief of staff -- on Thursday also resigned, telling CNBC: 'I can't stay here.'
This Commission pursues a clearly socialist agenda of centralized control under a regime of global governance that would enforce extreme environmental political correctness on a global basis.

FBI SEEKING HELP FROM PUBLIC TO IDENTIFY THOSE IN CAPITOL BREACH
Over the past fiscal year, the United States has already given almost $100 million – distributed through the Department of State and other agencies – to assist in the humanitarian response to the regional Venezuela contingency. In September, the U.S. pledged a further $48 million. Moreover, the Department of Defense spending in the region over the past year totaled more than $110 million.

They sought to redefine how people qualify for asylum and similar forms of humanitarian protection if they face persecution at home. The restrictions would have broadened the grounds for a judge to deem asylum applications frivolous and prohibit applicants from ever winning protections in the U.S.
If Obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.
Yet Venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of Cuba, Iran, China, Russia and Turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against Venezuela, and this year Turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela. And Russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent Maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.
All of this will be particularly challenging for populations that struggle with digital literacy and digital access – who have been hit hardest by the pandemic and who need to vaccine the most.

On Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.
She said she might have a glass of wine and take a bath tonight to relax. On Wednesday, Murkowski said she was offended when Democratic impeachment manager Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., tried to argue that senators would be participating in a coverup if they opposed Democrats' document requests -- an aggressive move that apparently backfired in the chamber, and led to a rare intervention from Chief Justice John Roberts.

But the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.

It was central to both Biden's primary and general election campaigns that he was the candidate best suited to be able to work with Republicans and I believe that's very much the case.
It's hard to express my shock and sadness at seeing America's legislative palace breached, a door to the U.S. House broken, and senators and House members hunkering down, apparently in gas masks. Most astonishing is to see those involved in this violence not waving Antifa flags but, instead, Trump and MAGA banners.
The impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to Chile or Colombia, while others ventured to Peru or Argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.

It's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to Moises Rendon, associate director and fellow for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
Donato took issue with how people came to lead the Department of Homeland Security. Wolf became acting secretary in November 2019, replacing Kevin McAleenan, who was also in an acting role.

Pelosi, 80, of course, is a frequent target of ire from President Trump and other Republicans, along with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Democrats' leader in the other chamber of Congress. The GOP typically regards Democratic policy proposals as unnecessary, expensive, overly restrictive – or some combination thereof.

INSIDE LATIN AMERICAN 'AMAZING RACE' STAR'S DRAMATIC ESCAPE FROM VENEZUELA
Authorities are investigating a fiery, multivehicle crash that left at least seven people dead and seven others injured in Florida
President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.
Consider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.

Democrats' impeachment managers said there was no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden did anything improper in dealings with Ukraine, and that President Trump sought a political investigation of Biden by Ukraine solely to sway the 2020 election in his favor.

If now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated. – Alexander Hamilton, in his essay The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, Federalist No. 9
In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.
One U.S government official closely monitoring the case told Fox News that while official displacement camps have not yet been established, calling this a last resort it is an option on the table being considered.
THE LEAD STORY – THE WALL BETWEEN TRUMP AND PELOSI: Newly empowered House Democrats late Thursday passed a bill to reopen the government without funding President Trump's border wall ... In a news conference Thursday night, newly-elected House Speaker Nancy Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial government shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22. Even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, Pelosi called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it. We're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall? Pelosi told reporters.
Some conservatives – like Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rand Paul, R-Ky. – began turning to the platform this year after becoming frustrated with content moderation on the major platforms.
I think we're making an airtight case for anyone who's willing to listen, Nadler told Fox News. The evidence is overwhelming. The president's counsels have not offered any evidence against it, nor will they, because there is no possibility. And as I said the other day, or yesterday, watch what the president's counselors say. It won't be refutations of the evidence; there won't be any new evidence, there will just be criticisms of the House managers, of our procedures, all irrelevant to the charges against the president.
The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia will inevitably have a relatively big impact on the economy and society,'' Xi said, adding that the impact would be short-term and controllable.
Similarly, they argued that there was no truth to the theory pushed by Trump and his allies that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. election. Although Democrats -- and some news outlets, including The Associated Press -- have repeatedly claimed that the idea of Ukraine meddling is a conspiracy theory, a Ukrainian court has ruled that officials in the country did illegally meddle in the U.S. election. Additionally, a 2017 investigative report by Politico found extensive efforts by Ukrainians to hurt Trump's presidential campaign.
Chinese policymakers have implemented a raft of measures to support an economy jolted by the virus, which is expected to have a devastating impact on first-quarter growth.
President Trump did the right thing Wednesday afternoon. He issued a video statement from the White House via Twitter and told his overzealous backers to beat it. They should heed his words at once: I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.

Jobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the Venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. Antonio Ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of Caracas and opposition leader now exiled in Spain, told Fox News more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.

The volatile situation saw lawmakers – Pelosi among them – seeking cover inside the building as protesters ran roughshod through hallways and even into lawmakers' offices.
Well, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.
We are not allowed by state law to give a single shot to a single New Yorker over 75. He announced in a tweet.
In a series of tweets New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer wrote that the process of making appointments for the vaccination is complicated and buggy. Especially for people over 75:

There will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the American people soon after Biden's inauguration. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Joe Ossoff are in D.C., that will be possible. If Republican Sens.

On Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.

'COUP HAS STARTED,' WHISTLEBLOWER ATTORNEY PROMISED IN 2017 TWEETS
The acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to Venezuelans, but to the region at large. The country is enduring a dire shortage of vaccinations and treatments for illnesses and diseases, prompting a concern that once eradicated conditions such as measles and diptheria are not only spreading in the financially depleted nation, but now threatens millions across Latin America.
The government has recycled exactly the same legal and factual claims made in the prior cases, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts, Donato wrote. This is a troubling litigation strategy. In effect, the government keeps crashing the same car into a gate, hoping that someday it might break through.
U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco sided with advocacy groups who sued, saying acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf lacked authority to impose the sweeping rules.

Trump repeats claims that drove mob in response to certification - Fox News: President Trump promised an 'orderly transition' on Jan. 20 after Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory. The certification came after a day in Washington, D.C., that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from Trump on Twitter that called for calm in the early hours of Thursday morning. 'Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,' the statement read.

Vindman, a National Security Council official, testified during House Democrats' impeachment inquiry last year that Trump's Ukraine dealings left him in a state of shock, and Democrats were quoting from Vindman's remarks during the Senate trial on Thursday. Vindman has denied knowing the identity of the whistleblower who flagged Trump's fateful July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president -- a claim that Republicans have questioned, because under cross-examination, Vindman apparently admitted to leaking the contents of Trump's call to the whistleblower.

ANALYST DISILLUSIONED WITH JOURNALISM AND 'TRUMP CIRCUS': Longtime military analyst William Arkin has stepped down from his role at NBC News with a scathing letter criticizing the current state of journalism as well as President Donald Trump ... Arkin, a U.S. Army veteran who has worked for NBC as a reporter and commentator over the course of three decades, wrote a 2,228-word internal memo obtained by CNN on Wednesday, declaring that the world and the current state of journalism have been in tandem crisis.

It is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.

Biden said to pick Boston mayor as Labor boss - Politico: President-elect Joe Biden has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former top union leader, to serve as his Labor secretary, according to four sources, ending a selection process that split the labor movement and stoked diversity concerns among Democrats. Walsh beat out a host of other names floated for the position, including Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris, California Labor Secretary Julie Su and AFL-CIO Chief Economist Bill Spriggs. His selection suggests that Biden was willing to overlook calls for a diversity choice, since Walsh is a white man, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders had been lobbying heavily for Su. Spriggs is Black.

However, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason.

He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.

Pelosi, 80, of course, is a frequent target of ire from President Trump and other Republicans, along with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the Democrats' leader in the other chamber of Congress.

Biden reportedly will name R.I. governor to lead Commerce - WSJ: President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo as his commerce secretary and Isabel Guzman, a California economic development official, to lead the Small Business Administration, according to people familiar with the matter.

I was one pooped puppy. — Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski
Fox News: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for President Trump's immediate removal from office by way of the 25th Amendment for inciting a violent riot at the Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to stop the counting of President-elect Joe Biden's win. She joins with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in urging Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to remove Trump from office immediately, calling him 'a very dangerous person' who committed an 'act of sedition.' Pelosi said if Pence won't act, the House is prepared to impeach Trump again. 'The president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' Pelosi said Thursday, a day after a pro-Trump supporters took over the U.S. Capitol. 'I joined the Senate Democratic Leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the Vice President and cabinet do not, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment.' 'The President of the United States incited an insurrection against America,' Pelosi added.
And on climate change, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe government should act more aggressively to combat climate change.

[Ed. note: Antifa most certainly is bad. So is social isolation. So is the decline of the nation's spiritual health. So is the rise of negative partisanship. So is the dearth of local news coverage. There's so much that is bad in American public life these days. But what really saddens me are those who pretend Wednesday's ransacking was inevitable. Aside from excusing the conduct of the vandals and rioters, it suggests somehow that the case for America is hopeless. What a sad betrayal of the sacrifices made to provide the extraordinary opportunities we now enjoy. The doom caucus helped lead us here. It's time to start tuning them out.]
And, although hats have been barred in the House chamber for more than a century, a new House rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear.

Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.
Yet Venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of Cuba, Iran, China, Russia and Turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against Venezuela, and this year Turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela. And Russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent Maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.
The effort that Ecuador is having to do here is proportional to Germany allowing a million Syrian refugees in, and yet there is a big difference as Germany is a big, industrial country with a lot of resources to tend to the crisis, Chavez said. Ecuador, in contrast, has very limited resources.

Transportation secretary to resign in protest - USA Today: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao will resign from her position, she announced Thursday. Chao, who is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is the first Cabinet secretary to resign after pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to halt the counting of Electoral College votes. 'Yesterday, our country experienced a traumatic and entirely avoidable event as supporters of the President stormed the Capitol building following a rally he addressed,' Chao said in a statement. 'As I'm sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.' Chao noted her office would continue to help Pete Buttigieg, President-elect Joe Biden's choice for transportation secretary, transition into his role.

At the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.

Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.

Anthony, I've got to tell you, there is no phrase I hate more than identity politics, Navarro snapped. When Republicans talk about identity politics, they're talking about people like me and people like Don. They're talking about our gender. They're talking about sexuality.

America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border, Trump said. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.

Identity politics, however, generally refers to those who make voting choices based on unchangeable features, such as race, sex, or orientation, rather than policy issues.

The president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:
It was not immediately clear if the Trump administration would make an emergency appeal. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.
They sought to redefine how people qualify for asylum and similar forms of humanitarian protection if they face persecution at home. The restrictions would have broadened the grounds for a judge to deem asylum applications frivolous and prohibit applicants from ever winning protections in the U.S.

At one point during his impeachment testimony last year, Vindman was caught in an apparent contradiction late in the day by Republican Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup. Vindman testified that he did not discuss his concerns about Trump's July phone call with the NSC's Tim Morrison, his superior, because he was unavailable. But, under questioning from Wenstrup, Morrison confirmed that Vindman had given him edits of the transcript of the call, on the same day that Vindman testified Morrison was unreachable.
The response to the speech underscores how increasingly polarized the debate has become and how little progress is being made toward a resolution to the standoff that triggered a partial government shutdown nearly three weeks ago.
Senate Environment Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer hasn't even introduced the bill yet; new Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Blanche Lincoln has declared the House bill dead on arrival; and there are several other cross-cutting controversies that divide Democrats on the bill.

On Tuesday, Trump underscored cases of Americans killed allegedly by illegal immigrants, including California police Cpl. Ronil Singh, who was murdered the day after Christmas -- allegedly by an illegal immigrant suspected of driving drunk.

'I've known Mike Pence forever,' Inhofe said Tuesday night. 'I've never seen Pence as angry as he was today.' 'I had a long conversation with him,' said Inhofe. 'He said, 'After all the things I've done for (Trump).'' Aside from Wednesday's attempted takeover of the Capitol, the past few days have been difficult for Inhofe because he refused to go along with protesting the Electoral College results. 'We've had calls. We've had threats. … I have many very, very close friends mad at me, when all I'm doing is upholding my oath,' Inhofe said.

Browner was made a czar so that her powers could be more sweeping than they would be in any single official appointment�witness her cross-agency role in the secret automobile emissions regulations�and to avoid the scrutiny of Senate confirmation, which would have been difficult for Browner.

Even the New York Times has been getting tough with its headlines on what was happening:
I was just sitting here wishing I could get Stirewalt's take on today's events, lamenting that there would probably be no Halftime Report today. Then this showed up in my inbox. We love you, Chris -- thank you. … I had held a cynical take on all this election fraud nonsense (that it was to raise money, or pressure states to rollback their vote-by-mail programs, or both). But I struggle to reconcile that take with the call with Brad Raffensperger. I do worry that Trump has now spent 8 weeks drinking his own Kool-Aid. – Shawn A. Van Ness, Browns Point, Wash.

By contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.

Biden said to pick Boston mayor as Labor boss - Politico: President-elect Joe Biden has picked Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, a former top union leader, to serve as his Labor secretary, according to four sources, ending a selection process that split the labor movement and stoked diversity concerns among Democrats. Walsh beat out a host of other names floated for the position, including Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris, California Labor Secretary Julie Su and AFL-CIO Chief Economist Bill Spriggs. His selection suggests that Biden was willing to overlook calls for a diversity choice, since Walsh is a white man, and Asian American and Pacific Islanders had been lobbying heavily for Su. Spriggs is Black.

The theory that blames Ukraine for interfering in the 2016 elections is no laughing matter, Schiff said, calling it central to the impeachment charges.

The Writer's Almanac: On this date in 1610, Galileo wrote a letter describing his discovery of three of Jupiter's moons. He discovered them in December, after improving his telescope design. He wasn't sure at first they were moons; he thought they were fixed stars. He soon realized that they were actually orbiting the giant planet. Since most people at that time still believed in the Ptolemaic theory that the Earth was the center of the universe and everything revolved around us, it was an important discovery. It went a long way toward confirming Copernicus's controversial theory that the Earth went around the sun and not the other way around, something that Galileo believed as well. A rival astronomer, Simon Marius, discovered the moons at about the same time, and he named them after four of Zeus's mythological lovers. Marius's names stuck, and today we know the moons as Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

THE RULEBOOK: RAYS OF GLORY FROM THE GLOOM
Fox News: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called for President Trump's immediate removal from office by way of the 25th Amendment for inciting a violent riot at the Capitol Wednesday in an attempt to stop the counting of President-elect Joe Biden's win. She joins with Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in urging Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to remove Trump from office immediately, calling him 'a very dangerous person' who committed an 'act of sedition.' Pelosi said if Pence won't act, the House is prepared to impeach Trump again. 'The president has committed an unspeakable assault on our nation and our people,' Pelosi said Thursday, a day after a pro-Trump supporters took over the U.S. Capitol. 'I joined the Senate Democratic Leader in calling on the vice president to remove this president by immediately invoking the 25th amendment. If the Vice President and cabinet do not, the Congress may be prepared to move forward with impeachment.' 'The President of the United States incited an insurrection against America,' Pelosi added.

There is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.
To many activists, Black Friday is the epitome of this shift, a purely commercial event designed to boost U.S. retailers ahead of the Christmas holidays, the symbol of capitalism run amok.

It is forecasted that Colombia will continue to receive the most migrants, at least another 1.2 million over the coming year totaling 2.2 million, while its expected Peru will have 1.4 million Venezuelans by the end of 2019. Ecuador, Brazil, as well as other countries in the Southern Cone, Central America and the Caribbean too are predicted to see a swell in Venezuelan arrivals.
Our Constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. Congress is vested with writing laws and the President is charged with executing those laws. This is especially true when it comes to immigration.
Some Democrats believe the companies need to do more to monitor content posted by users. Former First Lady Michelle Obama, for example, put out a statement following the raid on Capitol Hill this week saying that Silicon Valley needed to do more to prevent this type of monstrous behavior.

A U.S. judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration's most sweeping set of asylum restrictions less than two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
One of the biggest problems we're facing right now is the complicated hierarchy that's been created designating who gets the vaccine first, and the very strict fines that are being implemented for hospitals who gave shots to anyone not on a prioritized list.
An array of Colombian locals have set up their own makeshift shelters, or opened the doors to their own homes to assist the walkers on their long and arduous trek from the bordering nation.
But, like the title of his autobiography, Mr. Obama's measure of himself seems defined by the word audacity. It is no more evident than now.
The off-field spat began Thursday evening on Twitter, when Tennessee GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn quoted the commanding officer of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman as saying that Vindman was a political activist in uniform.
I promise you, if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol union, told the media after Trump's introductory remarks. I worked in Naco, Ariz., for ten years. We didn't have physical barriers in Naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.
Nonetheless, Chapman, the American Ambassador in Ecuador, underscored the U.S is committed to the cause, and said the Trump administration has long been resolute in supporting the humanitarian response in the region.
The day brought few new arguments, as Democrats focused primarily on the abuse of power impeachment article instead of the obstruction of Congress charge. Democrats' impeachment managers said there was no evidence that former Vice President Joe Biden did anything improper in dealings with Ukraine, and that President Trump sought a political investigation of Biden by Ukraine solely to sway the 2020 election in his favor.

If you ask those who lost loved ones in nursing homes, as my family did in 2020, his leadership has been a failure starting with his March 25 order to put COVID positive patients into nursing homes for 46 days, and the subsequent cover-up of the total number of seniors we've lost since then.
INGRAHAM INVESTIGATION: MORE TO UNCOVER CONCERNING BIDENS, BURISMA
People who crossed before had at least a few dollars in their pocket for basic needs. Now they have absolutely nothing, said Victor Bautista, director for development and border integration at the foreign ministry in Colombia. In just six months, we went from 170 thousand migrants here to one million. Sixteen months ago, we had just 32,000. Something must be done. The humanitarian issues are unbelievable, and they will hurt the entire region.
A WARNING TO PELOSI AND HOUSE DEMS: Republican strategist Colin Reed says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats should not celebrate too long. They are about to be reminded that governing is a lot more difficult than making campaign promises - and Democrats are far from being united ... In an op-ed on FOXNews.com, Reed writes: House Democrats are about to find out that governing is harder than campaigning. Their majority is paved through 31 districts won by Trump in 2016 that flipped blue in 2018, many of which had resided in the GOP column for generations.
Trump himself likely will soon deliver that message in person to congressional Democrats. In a show of normalcy towards the end of a whirlwind day of history and drama on Capitol Hill, Pelosi on Thursday evening formally invited Trump to deliver State of the Union speech in Congress on Jan. 29.
How the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear. The mounting impact of the partial shutdown, which initially was limited but will increase as more federal workers miss paychecks this cycle and services like those at national parks suffer, is likely to increase pressure on Congress and the White House to forge a deal in the coming days.
Trump met with Pelosi and other senior Democrats at a contentious meeting on Wednesday in the White House Situation Room, which included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen within five seconds, according to Republicans at the meeting. The sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new Congress was seated Thursday.
And we're only a number of days until we can be protected from him. But he has done something so serious that there should be prosecution against him.
Disappointing! Sick! Outrageous! Pro-Trump protesters inside the U.S. Capitol must stand down at once!
If now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them have been so justly celebrated. – Alexander Hamilton, in his essay The Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection, Federalist No. 9
Speaking Wednesday on Fox News' America's Newsroom, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez echoed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's language.
You're too smart for that, Navarro said.
Fox News' Chad Pergram, Marisa Schultz, Caroline McKee, Mike Emanuel, Thomas Firth, Andrew O'Reilly, Jason Donner, and Adam Shaw contributed to this report, as well as The Associated Press.
With left-wing CNN host Don Lemon moderating, Navarro went on a rant after Scaramucci noted that more than 74 million Americans had voted for Trump, a fact he said demonstrated a flaw in the system.
Other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.
President Donald Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, says the U.S. military withdrawal from northeastern Syria is conditioned on defeating the remnants of the Islamic State group, and Turkey assuring the safety of Kurdish fighters allied with the United States.
Donato, who was appointed to the bench in 2013 by President Barack Obama, wrote that Wolf's appointment violated an established order of succession. He said it was the fifth time a court has ruled against Homeland Security on the same grounds.
Yet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.
These un-American anarchists have performed an enormous disservice to President Trump, the America First movement, the more than 74 million voters who cast our ballots for him in November, and our beloved United States of America.
China's state media said Friday that President Xi Jinping urged the U.S. to respond reasonably to the virus outbreak in a phone call with President Donald Trump.
They also would have weighed several new factors against an applicant's ability to win protections, among them failure to pay taxes. Criminal records would still count against an asylum-seeker even if their convictions were expunged.
On Thursday, during his closing remarks, Schiff changed the argument somewhat. Invoking Vindman's statement that here, right matters, Schiff said that Trump needed to be removed because he was dangerous and trusted his personal attorney over the intelligence community.
We're going to use a sufficient amount of time to defend our case and point out the inconsistencies of their case. We're not going to run out the clock,'' he said.

DEADLY PILEUP ON I-75: At least seven people were killed and seven others were injured Thursday in a multivehicle crash on Interstate 75 near Gainesville, Florida, investigators said ... The Florida Highway Patrol said two tractor-trailer rigs and two passenger vehicles were involved in the crash, which unfolded about a mile south of Alachua. Alachua County Fire Rescue reported that flames ignited after 50 gallons of diesel fuel spilled on the highway. Emergency crews extinguished the fire and said they were treating the crash as a homicide investigation, but did not say why. The fire was so intense that authorities said it damaged parts of the road. At one point, the Alachua County Sheriff's Office dispatched a helicopter to look for potential victims in the woods off the highway. - Reported by Samuel Chamberlain

Fortunately, we'll be able to see this week where members of the U.S. Senate stand on allowing Carol Browner to direct taxpayer dollars and pursue vast new regulatory power grabs. Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana has introduced an amendment (SA 2440) to the Department of the Interior appropriations bill that prohibits any federal funding for Browner's policy directives. Any senator who votes against it is voting to support not just Carol Browner, but also her vast regulatory power grab and the president's system of unaccountable czars.
President Trump's administration argued that the measures were an appropriate response to a system rife with abuse and overwhelmed with unworthy claims.
It follows that divided government isn't good enough. In order for anything to be accomplished in Washington, and I mean anything, McConnell cannot remain in control.

Trump repeats claims that drove mob in response to certification - Fox News: President Trump promised an 'orderly transition' on Jan. 20 after Congress early Thursday certified the Electoral College vote that gave Democrat Joe Biden his presidential victory. The certification came after a day in Washington, D.C., that was marred by pro-Trump protesters storming the U.S. Capitol. Dan Scavino, the White House deputy chief of staff, posted a statement from Trump on Twitter that called for calm in the early hours of Thursday morning.

Earlier in the day, Democrats were laughing along as Schiff joked that Trump had made a religious man out of Vladimir Putin,'' a reference to a comment by Putin last November: Thank God,'' he told an economic forum in Moscow, no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine.
China believes President-elect Joe Biden represents a new window of hope for the country's relationship with the United States, according to state media.

But, Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill fired back, tweeting: A vote AGAINST the Democratic Rules package is a vote to let [Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)] Mick Mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing Democratic initiatives and funding increases.
President Trump did the right thing Wednesday afternoon. He issued a video statement from the White House via Twitter and told his overzealous backers to beat it. They should heed his words at once: I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.

CBS News: President-elect Joe Biden will announce Thursday he has selected Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for attorney general. Garland serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and was nominated by former President Barack Obama to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court in 2016. But his nomination was blocked by Senate Republicans who argued the American people should have a say in selecting the president who fills the vacancy. In addition to serving on the D.C. Circuit, where he was its chief judge until February 2020, Garland is a veteran of the Justice Department, leading the prosecutions of Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, and Ted Kaczynski, the 'Unabomber.'

The San Francisco Democrat sat down for a conversation with Lesley Stahl of the CBS News program last week following Wednesday's siege of the U.S. Capitol by a crowd of protesters.

On Tuesday, Trump underscored cases of Americans killed allegedly by illegal immigrants, including California police Cpl. Ronil Singh, who was murdered the day after Christmas -- allegedly by an illegal immigrant suspected of driving drunk. The suspect had multiple prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that California's sanctuary laws -- which prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities -- led to Singh's murder.
