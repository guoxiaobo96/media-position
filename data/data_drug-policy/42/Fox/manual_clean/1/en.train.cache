carlson: so what's your plan for the bernie ascendancy? are you going to stay in the country?
tucker carlson: that's right. it's exactly right. i mean, that's the difference in the parties. when democratic primary voters want something, their party gives it to them. when republican voters say they want something, their party gives them the finger and ignores them.

we've only gone up about one degree in a century in california. that's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed. what it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought.
u.s. and china. is this same deal that you told us about at the end of last year?
wallace: well, here, let's get to the bottom line, does the president think --
conway: well, he is -- the president is toying with everybody by saying, oh, had he said something like that, had you unearthed a videotape like that of him, everybody would say racist, racist.
ingraham: did he have large scale attacks planned for other embassies?
then, in late august, i was invited with my husband and his sister donna to join many lawmakers in albany to push legislation to create an independent commission to investigate the nursing home deaths. the passage was sponsored by sen. jim tedisco, r-glenville, and assemblyman ron kim, d-queens, in hopes of establishing a panel with subpoena power to perform a top-to-bottom review of the deaths reported in new york's elder care facilities at the height of the pandemic.
conway: the president could weigh in, but you see how the president weighs in. the president weighs into the whole world.
conway: this is important -- july 2017, and lies again.
tucker carlson: meanwhile, they're telling us that we're not allowed to take illegal firearms away from people. stop and frisk is immoral, but we need to disarm churchgoers? i'm starting to think this isn't really about public safety. call me cynical.

new york's coronavirus death toll in nursing homes, already among the highest in the nation, could actually be a significant undercount. but so far the administration of democratic gov. andrew cuomo has refused to divulge the number, leading to speculation the state is manipulating the figures to make it appear it is doing better than other states and to make a tragic situation less dire.

that's a lie. socialism is a disaster. it doesn't work. it's what we should be working desperately to avoid. but socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and very soon unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the american economy in a way that protects normal people.

thirty years ago, conservatives looked at detroit or newark and many other places and were horrified by what they saw. conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. the majority of children were born out of wedlock. single mothers were the rule. crime and drugs and disorder became universal.
and jobs? you were told in june we created 288,000 new jobs. what the media forgot to tell you is that 525,000 full-time middle class jobs were lost in june and 800,000 part-time crappy low wage jobs were created. does that sound like good news to you? no, it's more murder of the middle class.

jason roberge, r-va. congressional candidate: sure. so the democrats basically just started their session in virginia.
mnuchin: it is 70 percent, maria. but let me just say, it's 70 percent of a very, very small number.
pay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us. the real threat is iran. well, they're liars. and they don't care about you. they don't care about your kids. they are reckless and incompetent. and you should keep all of that in mind, as war with iran looms closer tonight.
wallace: we'll ask our sunday panel what the new majority means for the
carlson: so there was that and he won a vote or two with that unusual argument. his other argument was that voters should vote for him based on his identity. the video announcing the end of his candidacy opened and closed with a line in spanish, which basically said it all, vote for me because of my background and because i speak spanish.

rep. adam schiff, d-calif.: do the biden's have any relevant testimony? and i think the answer is that they don't. there has been no factual basis for these allegations against joe biden to ask the senate, do these investigations that the president fraudulently sought to get ukraine to conduct would merely turn the senate trial on its head. now that's something the president would love. but that's not a fair trial. that's a sham trial.
wallace: well, and there's a new poll, an abc/washington post poll that says 53 percent for the president and republicans try -- anyway.
that's a bad rap. exhibit a: venezuela.

particularly worrisome in recent years has been the mixture in many overdose cases of cocaine and illicit fentanyl, authorities say. the same is happening with meth, said van ingram, executive director of the kentucky office of drug control policy, to the washington times.

kasraie: so i just want to give out a quick shout out to president trump. there is a picture circulating right now on social media. there's a wall in iran, as soon as the news broke, it's a hashtag, which in english translates to trump, you're the man. so thank you, president trump, for having moral courage to make such a hard decision.

this is a state that is in many ways reflective of the future of america and i'm really excited to be on the ground here working to earn that support in the week that remains.
lot about protecting i.p. for american companies and innovators.
the problem is that socialist theory provides no checks and balances in socialism to keep the ideology from devolving into what churchill called the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy. in practice, power to the people in places like venezuela quickly starts channeling into more and more power in the hands of government.
ned ryun: this is unreal, tucker. i mean, again, you pointed out that trump gave him a strong backstop back in september and said you can opt out of this with his executive order and now you have these 18 republican governors saying no, we want more. and they're saying well, we're following our hearts. this is, you know, christian charity in action. i got to say this, tucker, as a active devout evangelical christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors and quite frankly a perverse incentive for these government-funded charities that are acting as refugee contractors grifting off the american taxpayer. michelle malkin has written about some of this but the u.s. state department is paying these refugee contractors over $2,100 per refugee of which they get to keep 45 percent and then they're doing this campaign on these governors saying you have to put your christian charity into action and in an act of cowardice most of these governors from red states are giving in to this. first of all, --
trump: we are here today to address the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. this is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.
who are we worried about? seniors, compromised immune system, people with underlying illnesses. where are the places we're really worried about? nursing homes, senior congregate facilities.
rep. jim clyburn (d-sc), house majority whip: thank you very much for
the development is, in part, an outgrowth of the crackdown on opioids in the u.s., and the result of cartels finding other drugs. the 2018 national drug threat assessment (ndta), released last fall, noted the rise of more potent forms of meth and cocaine in the united states.
our leaders rarely mention any of this. they tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. please. it's based on laws that the congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. it worked well for those people. they did increase their economic advantage. but for everyone else, it came at a big cost. unfairness is profoundly divisive. when you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. they hate each other.

he never was able to get a foothold. and the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized.
ingraham: mark, stop grandstanding on my show. you can do it all day long. you can do it in a church where we have a person licensed to carry weapons as we had in texas or florida where people are allowed to carry a weapon that has an extended clip in it that's 10 or 12. and you can defend a lot of people getting killed with a clip that's 10 or more period. so the idea the government is going to tell you that you can't defend with a type of clip or magazine is obscene.
many media outlets published her name, including the new york times, the washington post and cnn, all of which, of course, jackson approves up because they're on her side.

the mexican meth is so cheap you couldn't make it for cheaper than you could buy it, said ingram. meth-related fatal overdoses rose in kentucky by nearly 30 percent in 2017 from 2016. nationally, they totaled some 10,000 in 2017, the times said.

jackson accuses the show of invading the privacy of the foreman of the jury, when in fact the jury her herself has spoken publicly and revealed her own identity.
ingraham: oh, but she's trying, because warren has begun pitching her on backchannel stories to the media in an effort to hobble bernie. here is today's headline from cnn. bernie sanders told elizabeth warren in private 2018 meeting that a woman can't win, sources say. but just hours ago, warren went on record saying it's true, and that sanders, quote, disagreed during their meeting that a woman could win the nomination.
across the border from their children.
cicilline: look -- i'm not going to -- look, it's kind of odd to hear people on the republican side who have not condemned the president's language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language. like, look, this is a private event, she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate. the fundamental issues democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we're going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives, and we're going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way.
why? because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in washington.
president trump is also requesting $675 million for new technology to detect and stop the flow of illegal drugs over the border. democrats have long said they wanted that. but democrats don't want to have an honest conversation about border security. they are now the party of obstruction, and everything must bend to their resist trump goals. the hill reports that their latest strategy is to jam up the senate by refusing to consider any legislation until the government is reopened.
conway: -- trafficking drugs, humans and guns, for example. any number of issues you work on with the department of justice, this is small potatoes. but people see it from what it is.
jeff stier, senior fellow, consumer choice center: good to be here.

both sides miss the obvious point: culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. certain economic systems allow families to thrive. thriving families make market economies possible. you can't separate the two. it used to be possible to deny this. not anymore. the evidence is now overwhelming. how do we know? consider the inner cities.
sanders: i think the president's got a lot. immigration certainly has to be at the forefront. right now, that's one of the biggest things that we have to get done is securing our border.

the capitol, president trump put out this video.
ingraham: thanks to samantha and whitney for putting on that tearful goodbye.
so here's the question: i understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of democrats, including pelosi, including schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. so why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that lindsey graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on dreamers and on tps immigrants?

ingraham: but there no - there's no understanding at this moment, how that debate about witnesses will ensue and unfold so we don't know if it'll be you get two, we get two. doesn't know - we don't want one in one, witnesses period, yes, thumbs up so there's no sense and so there's concern that just the debate matt, on that fact, could just throw the whole thing into a - i mean, more like the house than the senate. in other words a lot of chaos or are we just - are we inflating what might- -

supporters of police reform celebrated his win as part of a broader movement to end harsh incarceration sentences in favor of more meaningful remedies that address poverty, systemic racism and addiction. but that hasn't eased fears of people who say that san francisco is too lax on repeat offenders.
then jackson herself lied about the case. she claimed that stone had been prosecuted because he covered up for the president, when in fact the charges against roger stone had nothing to do with that.
kasraie: the government of iran has about 4 million employees. so obviously they gave the employees the day off. a lot of people that you see there are from rural villages. they bus people in, they give them incentives like food. and as you know, right now, the economy in iran is plummeting. people are hungry, they are jobless. the value of the dollar has decreased tremendously. so the people that you see at the rally not only are paid to be there, but they are intimidated to come.
yet again, however, the pelosi doctrine is do as i say, not as i do.
charles lane, fox news contributor: well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. and let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. and he, so far, has not delivered.
these are just a few examples of many that show a clear trend: speaker pelosi is more interested in maintaining her position atop the washington, d.c. political class and satiating the radical desires of her followers than protecting our country's national security.

wallace: house democrats have an ambitious agenda as they take over the majority from infrastructure to health care, to investigations of the trump administration. but their first priority is to end the government shutdown.
ingraham: now, we brought up the fact that the former obama administration officials were out in force defending the iranians, yes, and attacking the president. the question is why?
today, the center is almost empty and state authorities thought it would be the perfect place to send people who test positive for coronavirus. that is until the mayor, city council and local residents said uh-uh. watch.

levine: you are allowed to keep your weapons. we're not taking people's guns away, and the list you gave is not an accurate list either. so no, i'm afraid you're misinformed.
wallace: let me just interrupt because i have two minutes left and i want to get to questions in.
in the meantime, cuomo's excess regulations and prioritizations and threatened fines clearly slow the wheels of progress towards widespread vaccinations that will lead to herd immunity. cuomo announced monday that hospitals in his state could be fined $100,000 if they did not administer all their vaccine doses this week, and could be denied further doses.
what i do know, chris, is there are things that are different. when we saw
unidentified male: what the president said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. i shared that view.
rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., speaker of the house: what the president is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders.
this fight is just getting started. i will not go down without a fight. will you? get informed and join the battle.
mills: thanks. so you hear a lot from the left about how concerned about the environment they are. but you've noticed that those concerns have always conveniently dovetailed with acquiring more political power and crushing their political enemies.
wallace: so what are you saying, the deal should be some money for the wall, something between $1 billion and $5 billion in return for some concessions on people in this country illegally, like dreamers and the temporary protected status refugees?

carlson: it is terrifying that someone like that sits on a federal bench. roger stone needs a pardon. and let's get past this. that's my view.
the economy is in crisis and collapse. the gdp for the first quarter was negative 2.9%, one of the worst showings in history, six years after obama's trillion dollar stimulus promised to save the economy. that stimulus went to obama's voters (the poor) and obama's donors (the super rich). but the bill (in the form of debt) goes to the middle class for decades to come.

siegel: despite several hundred cases of coronavirus, flights continue to come in from tokyo. in fact, one is currently in customs.
i'll tell you what happened, i got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally democratic, but socially conservative community. more than i had the first time that i ran for office.
and what really happened was that infusion of cash and the cessation of those sanctions created a terrorist whirlwind from iran into lebanon, into syria, into yemen. and they're embarrassed about it, because this plan was bankrupt, it was crazy. and i think secretary pompeo and trump realize that and yet they know that our real interests are in china with - in dealing with china and there's existential threat. so, they're sort of like sheriff's backing out of this middle east saloon and saying, this place is a mess, but we're going to have a revolved result and restore deterrence. and that's hard to do.
it wasn't fine. we know that now. at least 35 countries have confirmed cases of coronavirus as of tonight. last friday, italy reported six, yet at midday today, they had 283 and then by tonight, that number had risen to 322. that is a steep trajectory.
justice with judge jeanine, saturday, 9 p.m. et: special guests include: acting ice director ron vitiello.
but i think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. the president thinks andrew mccabe probably should have been charged and he thinks roger stone is getting railroaded. if he were really intervening, the charges against roger stone would have been dropped and andrew mccabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.

josh is right, we're talking about $4 billion. that is one-tenth of 1 percent of the federal budget. out of every $100 spent by the federal government, we're talking about if you gave them $4 billion for the wall, it would be $0.10 out of every --
arroyo: but laura, these categories are chosen by people in those respective fields. to think that they're engineering racism.
arroyo: we don't want any laughs from kamala harris.
carlson: tammy bruce hosts get tammy bruce on fox nation. she joins us tonight. tammy, great to see you. so that clip made me feel old because i know pete buttigieg in his teens or whatever, but that obama clip was from 2012 which wasn't that long ago. apparently, pete buttigieg thinks no one is going to remember that.
i asked hammond about this, and his answer gave me some hope that journalism isn't dead … yet.
carlson: it's a great movie. and if you want to see it in theaters, you still have a chance to do that. the film is having a limited release this weekend, thanks to strong support from grateful viewers.
officials. tell us about these latest round of sanctions against iran.
would be subject to secondary sanctions. and they understand that. and even
cicilline: i mean, i think we believe the government must reopen immediately. i mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the tsa. i mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. the president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. it's impacting people's lives.
wallace: wait, wait, wait -- i know the statistic; i didn't know you were going to use it. but i studied up on this.
u.s. has targeted iran's billion-dollar metals industry and senior regime
on this broader issue of barr and the democratic reaction, i think your question was good. have the democrats learned their lesson? we have people talking about impeachment of bill barr, which i think is ludicrous.
lee, you say there is a reason that the obama officials seem very upset over the killing of soleimani.
my friends, like everything else, this is all about politics for the democrats. pretty much every demographic group is doing better now than they were a few years ago. the democrats don't have any have no answer. they've completely given up trying to outdo trump on raising the standard of living for americans. so, all they have to run on is this shutdown and their opposition to his wall. oh, and trump's a racist. that's all they have.
if anybody has the right to feel uncomfortable, it is the thousands of family members who lost loved ones. many who would still be here today if they were better protected at a time when they were most vulnerable.
let me start with you, congresswoman slotkin. how?
sen. elizabeth warren, d-ma., presidential candidate: how about we stop making poverty a crime? no more cash bail. this is crazy.
how miserable is it? since maduro came to power, more than 3 million venezuelans have fled the country. most remain in latin america, but nearly 400,000 have come to the u.s.
wallace: the state department says there hasn't been any terrorists that they've found coming across the southern border with mexico.
economic sanctions on tehran. economic war is winning.
tucker carlson: they're thinking, let's get some. that's what they're trained to do. that's their job. their job is to be there, be ready and to not question so much why as to how and when. that's their job. but when they go, and they experience war like i've done twice and they come back and maybe they have an injury, maybe they lost buddies. they get 10 years older, 10 years wiser. they pay attention a little bit more to politics. and they say, why was out there? what was i accomplishing, and what was i told? and how much of it was true? i think president trump at this very moment is as inclined for military as he is diplomacy. and he's thrown the ball in the court of iran today with a tweet to say, listen, you're not going to win a war, but you might win at the negotiating table, because i think that is his end goal. and he may have made it through advisers or through his own wisdom to the point that he understands maybe that's all iran will respond to. that's our hope. that's our hope today. is that iran responds to military force. we really don't have a playbook to see if they will, and it's quite a risk and a gamble. and it's ultimately the gamble of men and women just like myself.
and, mr. secretary, it's good to see you this morning. thanks very much for
impeachment, i sent her a letter about process, could we have a fair

wallace: when we come back, as former new york city mayor michael bloomberg rises in the polls, troubling comments from his past are resurfacing. the sunday panel will tackle that, next.
i think there must be politics at all levels involved in this because none of it makes sense.

sen. jeff merkley (d-or): they're going to have to search their heart and ask if they're able to set aside their preconceptions, all of us, all 100 of us and if we are unable to do that, if we're unable to in good faith say we'll set aside our preconceptions, look at the exact language of the house articles of impeachment, the exact evidence and how it fits, then we should recuse ourselves.
coons: so, compromise and while the government is shut down, i will remind you we got 41,000 federal law enforcement officers out there today being forced to work without pay. we've got farmers all over the country not getting the relief payments for the impact on the soybean industry due to tariff war.

elected officials, the party infrastructure. how much support has donald
williams: no, not surrender. see, i don't think it's a matter of capitulation or surrender. i think it's a matter of saying to the president, let's be honest about this. you had two years of republican majorities, didn't get done. you had the senate majority leader say let's negotiate. you refused. so it's bad behavior.

ingraham: erica, what's your message for the american media today? nancy pelosi said when you kill the number two in any country, people are going to get upset. the number two.
ingraham: look at the pictures, the size of the crowds. to people who might not know a lot about the region, that looks like a revered philanthropist, humanitarian, oprah-like figure has been killed. chris matthews compared the death of soleimani to how people felt when princess diana and elvis died.

we're stigmatizing people who choose to infect someone else with hiv. and they say, well, you know, science and medicine is so much different now that you can take a one a day pill, and you're basically going to be okay. so it's not that big of a deal to have hiv. that's their argument, which of course, there's certainly truth to the point of medicine and how it's no longer the death sentence it once was.

president trump now says the government shutdown could go on for months or even years. with the standoff over the border wall now in its third week, white house officials and congressional staffers met saturday to work towards a deal, but prospects for a breakthrough remain dim as the new democratic majority in the house seems determined to stand up to president trump.
obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. but we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. and it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.
and the people in the streets support donald trump.

they had more information and evidence than we did. and so now you have a
benjamin hall: yes. good evening, tucker. as you point out, the whole region has been on high alert all day, waiting for some kind of retaliation from iran. but actually, what we heard reports of in the last couple of hours are possible strikes by the u.s. these are unconfirmed, we've heard conflicting reports. but there are suggestions that two cars were hit just north of baghdad a few hours ago and that they contained more iranian-backed shia militias, including a key finance facilitated close to qasem soleimani. but of course, it is qasem soleimani that everybody is talking about. the head of the al quds force, some people say the second most powerful man in iran and the man responsible for so many hundreds of u.s. deaths. he was killed leaving baghdad airport early this morning, having flown in from lebanon. a u.s. reaper drone was waiting to take him out. and alongside him, the man who was in charge of the storming of the u.s. embassy. five others also killed there. people are saying now that this strike may really severely strain u.s.-iraqi relations. and in fact, the iraqi prime minister spoke out earlier today and didn't mince his words. he said he condemned the targeting killing as a violation of the terms which underpin the u.s. troop presence in this country. and he went on to say that he has submitted a formal request for parliament to convene in order to adopt necessary measures to protect iraq's dignity and sovereignty.

trump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in mcallen. the president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and bricks of heroin and methamphetamine.

cocaine overdose deaths rose to about 14,500 in 2017, twice what they were in 2015. some areas of the country have seen a sharper rise in cocaine- and meth-related deaths. often, illicit opioids such as fentanyl are mixed in with the drugs. in connecticut, from a mix of cocaine and fentanyl soared to 220 in 2017 from 42 in 2015.
trump's ex-'fixer' to testify: michael cohen, president trump's former personal attorney, has agreed to testify before the house oversight and reform committee on feb. 7, almost exactly one month before he starts serving prison time for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to congress about trump's past business dealings in russia ... in a statement, cohen said he accepted the invitation to appear from rep. elijah cummings, d-md., the committee's chairman, [i]n furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the american people with answers. cummings said the committee was in the process of consulting with special counsel [robert] mueller's office to ensure that cohen's scheduled testimony would not interfere with the ongoing investigation into interactions between the trump campaign and russian officials.
in other states, authorities have sounded the same theme.

don't focus on what democrats say. watch what they do. the democrats want this shutdown to go on as long as possible to divide as many republicans from the president as they can. they want to peel off one after another and ratchet up the political pressure -- our safety and security be damned.
wallace: finally, on november 7th, you pointed this out and i want to -- i
but i don't think it's the case that, oh, therefore if they had found something right away it would have led to immediate charges against this president.
trump: i think that's what they believe, at the same time as i said before, he can't get through a sentence without stumbling. he's got real problems. i mean here's a man that was in the senate for longer than i've been alive, laura, right? yet he blames all of america's problems on my father. it's kind of ironic how that works. here's a guy who gave iran $150 billion. they ended up building missiles that they did shot at one of our air bases. here's a guy a guy who has a son, who profited in you know off of the presidency of the united states, of a vice presidency of united states, took $1.5 billion from china just a couple days ago. abc reported that his brother was doing the same thing as it came to charter schools in florida. this guy's got a lot of problems. this guy has a lot of problems aside from the fact that he lacks charisma and again, he hasn't exactly been a good mouth piece for them because he keeps on stumbling and going off on these terrible rants. he's got real problems.
then, my family and a person i knew at every single place i had lived, worked or attended school was interviewed to verify that the biography i provided was accurate.
so, if this really did happen, congress needs to know about it and what i want to do is make sure how could the fbi do that? what kind of checks and balances are there?
but this was a policy by the obama administration that was not accidental, and lee is absolutely right.
but the opposite has been the effect. it is now unsafe, unhealthy, unaffordable, and for many, unlivable. it's a dystopia in a lot of ways.
a second impeachment could happen in just days.
well, in the democrats' case, if you built it with these goofballs, the people will run. but it wasn't so much the candidates' talent or skill set that excited the resistance media that was covering all of this. it was what the field collectively represented.

as you just heard, new york city appears to be doing everything that it can to create more grafton thomas's. a new year's day new bail laws went into effect in new york state. those aren't going to help.
and after this airstrike and killing of soleimani, we've actually forced them together because the people of iraq may not like the iranians, but they don't necessarily want their country turned into a battleground between the united states and iran. so, i hope we'll just leave. that's the key. if we get out, then we're going to have to watch for what the iranians are likely to do, and we can talk about that if you like.

as president trump takes a courageous stand to demand true border security in the face of congressional obstruction, the fake news media continue to shamelessly regurgitate democratic talking points, including the phony claim that supposed experts oppose the border wall.

that is somebody who looks at people beneath him differently and we can't have that. and i -- i cannot -- i literally this week -- i got pretty big shock absorbers, my friend, i cannot believe all the prominent african- americans i've seen publicly say, i think we can support bloomberg because after all, he's electable, he's the one who can beat donald trump.

wallace: we'll ask mayor pete buttigieg about his pitch to voters in nevada, south carolina, and the super tuesday states.

question, what is the president's strategy?
levine: that's a great question. let me answer that question.
human trafficking is believed to be one of the largest-scale crimes in the world, with 24.9 million people trapped by human traffickers who make more than $150 billion in annual profit for the industry, ivanka trump said, adding that there are no demographic limitations to human trafficking, which exploits society's most vulnerable populations like women and children.
here in nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where i'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. and a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.
schwedhelm: ebola was highly infectious, but not as contagious. and this virus that we're talking about the covid-19 is more like influenza in how it spread through respiratory droplets.
ultimately has resulted in making the problem that you're trying to cure
wallace: all right, let's go -- let's move on. i don't want to talk about mitch mcconnell. i want to talk about the shutdown.
the president has been focused on an agenda. he has a team. he's got tony sayegh, pam bondi, patsy baloney (ph). they've got great people to white house focus on impeachment. but the president himself is focused on an economy that is ripping right now. on the national security front, he takes out qasem soleimani and the democrats are so invested into hating trump that they can't root for the iranians, the millions of iranians who want to pursue a new direction and they're trying to make the president look bad, taking out soleimani.
including a capitol police officer, died.

unless the investigation is in (ph) -- if a democratic server (ph) happened
wallace: when we come back, we'll discuss that shocking report. the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether president trump was working for the kremlin.
if they wanted the government reopened the dems could negotiate with the president and reopen it tomorrow. he's already compromised on the structure of the wall and dropped his asking price. and while the democrats feign concern over spending a few billion on a border wall - $5.7 billion - the coastal wonder twins of their party, gov. gavin newsom of california and mayor bill deblasio of new york, have all kinds of money — they'd spend pots of money - for the health care of illegal immigrants. they have no problem finding pots of money to spend on the well-being and health of illegal aliens.
this is not c-span 3. this is going to be on global television. that's why
rantz: they try actually not to make it so that we can hear them talk. that's the problem. so this bill was kind of snuck in there. not a lot of people were paying attention to it until we just caught wind of it and we talked about it on the show.
janice dean: coronavirus cost my in-laws their lives. gov. cuomo, our vulnerable loved ones deserved better
they can't win so what - what are they trying to do, right? i mean, they're trying to get very, very lucky. throw a 'hail mary' and hopefully something will stick and it's not going to happen and he's going to totally get acquitted in the senate and they're walking him into victory in 2020.
jim antle: well, a lot of it depends on what's going to happen next. i think president trump --
smith: well, it's worthwhile keeping in mind when you're looking at democratic officials like speaker pelosi and when you're looking at the press, including the most prestigious brands in the media that these were - these constituted the iran deal, echo chamber that helped sell obama's deal with iran. so, they have a lot at stake in protecting obama's foreign policy legacy.

buttigieg: well, i think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. but the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.
i put forward this proposal to be included in the rules package for the house of representatives this week, which are the procedures that the house of representatives will operate by for the next two years. apparently to defend rep. swalwell and other members who leak information to their allies in the liberal media, speaker nancy pelosi blocked my amendment.
bruce: well, that's it. i don't think he can, too. he wants to run as being who he is as a gay man, but then he also wants to run as being someone else. and that's really breaking the barrier when it comes to identity politics, isn't it?
a peace process between the colombian government and rebels had the unintended result of spawning more land use for the production of coca leaf, as the previous president stopped aerial fumigation meant to destroy coca crops. farmers then switched to coca in the hope of qualifying for a government offer to compensate those who were growing the crop.
i know you obviously have a lot of experience with this individual. the
congresswoman harman, how do you answer greg?
mac donald: they're scared. i mean, they're absolutely terrified of the racism charge. i was at a house judiciary committee hearing that talked about the criminal justice system. i was very disappointed in the republicans. they just spouted bromides about our men and women in blue without actually combating the lie that the criminal justice system is racist.
i hope justice ginsburg serves for a long time, but there's an opening on this court, i'm going to be hell-bent to put a conservative to replace whoever steps down for whatever reason.

stone received more than three years in prison. he'll be over 70 when he gets out. officially his crime was lying about e-mails, e-mails that were themselves entirely harmless.
but i think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. it doesn't achieve the objective. democrats are committing to securing our borders. we have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.

iran has confirmed 15 deaths plus 95 cases, although the real number is believed to be higher than that. one of those infected is the country's own deputy health minister, who was seen sweating profusely on monday at a press conference downplaying the outbreak.
prager: i think he is right about the comedic community. that's correct. outside of that, i don't think it's true. san francisco 49'er color announcer -- and i'm not sure you could use that term any longer -- simply said in describing the baltimore ravens quarterback who is a terrific quarterback and who is black and he said, you know, there might be the slight half second advantage in a handoff because the ball is black and the uniform is black and he is black. so the offensive line doesn't see it quite as quickly.

fitton: i've been calling it the 'gossip girl' impeachment and parnas has more gossip to add about things we already know about, that rudy giuliani was concerned about corruption in ukraine. i don't understand what the news is here. parnas is not providing any evidence of impeachable acts by the president of the united states. it's interesting in the gossip oriented way but the idea that he has any evidence to provide the senate and that's one of the big issues here. you talk about a senator saying we have to consider the evidence. they don't have any evidence.
trump: if he fought really hard against president obama, like he does against me, he would have won the election. does that make sense to you?
wallace: well, wait, wait, let me -- let me -- as the shutdown drags into its fourth week, both sides are digging in harder than ever. take a look.
look, some of these are issues that our country's about to face are among the most intractable we've ever had, but you've got to arrive at those -- at those challenges with -- with the ability to explain your record and with an ability to explain how you're going to raise the bar at a time when we are finally asking a lot more from our elected leaders.

bartiromo: well, they want to hear from john bolton.

tomorrow, we're going to try and follow up with the idea that chelsea clinton is a public health professor weighing in on the coronavirus. that ought to worry you.
conway: well, a couple things, very different to pick up the phone and ask your attorney general to do something in a criminal case, the president hasn't done that. he had -- he says he hasn't done it, bill barr said he hasn't done it, he hasn't done it.
attorney general william barr takes an unusual public swipe at president trump over his criticism of the justice department.

graham: i just talked to them about 30 minutes ago. he says let's make a deal. they did not turn down wall for the bridge, that's not that story line. i tried to see if we could open up the government for limited period of time to negotiate a deal and the president says, let's make a deal, then open up the government.
wallace: there are plenty women who would say the same thing about michael bloomberg.

and today, we learned that spartacus himself, it cannot be, cory booker, he's also calling it quits. frankly, i was shocked, what with his high polling numbers of, i don't know, six percent? but let's not forget the dems' latecomer candidate who had entered the race just seven weeks reinjecting the field with much-needed diversity and that common man's touch.
wallace: what's going to go on? president says make a deal, the democrats say not funding for the wall. not saying it's right or wrong --

ingraham: eric, the 'real clear politics' average right now. joe biden, despite their attempts i think to kind of knock him down a peg or two, he's still way up there. 27 percent. now this is a national poll so people focus on state by state so i understand but still an interesting snapshot. sanders is at 19. warren's at 16. buttigieg, who we've relentlessly seen pushed by the media and hollywood, way down below everybody at 7.2 percent. so is this joe biden's to lose in my view. politico, i think it was politico had a headline today, you know, they - all their efforts have to not. biden's still at the top of the heap. doesn't he have appeal to african-americans and more middle of the road democrats, maybe even some independent? you're worried about him, aren't you?

one of the challenges of negotiating with president trump, as lindsey graham knows better than anyone else, is i feel like i've signed up for the trump of the day club. i don't know what position we're going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two. it was senator graham who famously talked about tuesday trump and thursday trump when he and senator durbin brought a comprehensive resolution, a bill, to president trump last year, he embraced on tuesday and then walked away and announced it on thursday.

- this is a demonstration of how the city is going to implode if they don't fix it and fix it fast because you're going to continue to have people like this out on the streets.
now, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but america appears to be lumbering toward a new middle east war. and we have to say it's one that official washington has wanted for decades.

rove: no. and we have a disconnect between i -- what i thought was an excellent speech by pompeo. he opens up by saying, america is a force for good in the middle east. repudiates the obama era doctrines. but there is a disconnect between that and pulling us out of syria.
when coronavirus first broke out in china, china refused to admit international health experts into their country to assess it. to this day, it seems likely that china is lying about the number of infections and the number of deaths. yet despite this, tedros has publicly praised the communist chinese party for transparency.

there's white house counsel pat cipollone; trump's personal attorney, jay sekulow and just today, frequent guests on this show, it's like one of our legal panels, ken starr, alan dershowitz and robert ray, all added in various capacities. there's also jane raskin and pam bondi, both formidable female attorneys, they're just great attorneys, forget whether they're female or not. so you compare that all-star line-up, serious legal people, astute legal minds to the partisan hacks that nancy pelosi tapped for the prosecution. while six out of seven impeachment manager's hand-picked by nancy, supported impeachment even before the whistle blower complaint. how's that for impartial? further schiff and nadler and company couldn't prove that trump committed a single crime and that's despite rigging the entire house inquiry and having the media in their corner. so do we really think schiff is going to be somehow more convincing in the senate chamber than alan dershowitz, a constitutional scholar who just so happens to be a liberal who didn't vote for trump? well, it's going to be a blow out for the republicans and we're going to be covering it every step of the way. but here's the thing, the trial should even get this far. mitch mcconnell needs to put a motion to dismiss in the resolution that is going to govern trial rules. now this impeachment is a complete farce, letting the trial play out with only validate the house's unconstitutional abuse of power.

in theory, under socialism, the community as a whole owns or regulates all the means of the production and exchange. the idea is that this will assure that the working class controls the economy and gets its fair share of its benefits—the goods and services they produce.

graham: let's start with the president. i ask him, mr. president if you want to go down the emergency path, i stand with you. he said just 30 minutes ago, that's my last option. i think the legislative route is the best way to go, let's make a deal, but i will do it if i have to.
plus, as the speaker sends the articles of impeachment to the senate, alan dershowitz and gregg jarrett are going to give you everything you need to know about what happens next. and i'm going to make a suggestion that mitch mcconnell must listen to and i mean must, i am going to tell you what that is. just a few moments.

if you had a nickel for every time a democrat used arguments about science in discussions about climate change, you'd be rich. scientific studies about the existence of climate change – be it man-made or naturally occurring – are often used as cudgels against opponents of the left's radical environmental agenda or international regulatory regimes like the paris climate accord.

we fought isis in syria and then for some reason stuck around. we're still there. we joined humanitarian missions in lebanon and somalia. our special forces have been quietly fighting in yemen, pakistan, niger, who knows where all else. many other places. in every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. the benefits? often, they've been non-existent. a lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. certainly, they did. hope that makes you feel better. what do the american people think about all of this? not that anyone cares. well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. the killing of soleimani happened just last night. but just five months ago after months of supposed iranian provocation. american's didn't seem to view iran as a major concern, not even close. in a gallop poll taken last august, just 18 percent of americans said that they backed military force to shut down iran's nuclear program. seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. so, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual americans don't enter the equation at all. they're immaterial. in 2016, donald trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well. he vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home, which are growing.
the two things the democratic house have done now legislatively, they've introduced a bill to -- on voting rights, to get corruption out of washington, and they've passed bills to reopen the government. so i think they put down a marker this week that they are not here to play. they have an agenda. they're going to push it forward.
trump: good to be with, laura.
california church draws backlash for sign: 'bruce jenner is still a man.'
romney's main complaint in the piece is that donald trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. that's true, of course. but beneath the personal slights, romney has a policy critique of trump. he seems genuinely angry that trump might pull american troops out of the syrian civil war. romney doesn't explain how staying in syria would benefit america. he doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. more policing in the middle east is always better. we know that. virtually everyone in washington agrees.

i will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place. majority leader mitch mcconnell put a bill on the floor that was adopted unanimously by the senate at the end of last year that would have kept the government open and supported 1.3 billion in border security. the president reversed position the next day and rejected something he told mitch mcconnell he would sign.

however, when it comes to legalizing recreational marijuana, democrats sing a much different tune. many of the same folks who have been pushing for healthier school lunches, soda bans, lower salt content in food and calorie disclosures at restaurants suddenly don't care about legalizing a substance that has been scientifically proven to worsen our national public health crisis.
donald trump: we took action last night to stop a war. we did not take action to start a war. we do not seek regime change. however, the iranian regime's aggression in the region including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors must end and it must end now if americans anywhere are threatened we have all of those targets already fully identified and i am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary.
carlson: good to see you. as we go tonight, we have a fixture on the screen. it is the birthday of our executive producer justin wells. we can't tell you how old he is because we don't know, but we do know he is the single best producer in all of television.
for about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class. eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging. they're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, over policed neighborhoods, whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more.
roberge: yes. basically any of these guns that hold a resealable clip or magazine. the way you can read the statute, it's very vague. and they are purposely doing this because they want to take away millions and millions of these guns.

tucker carlson: well, that's exactly right. and so now especially that this country's energy independent we were promised for decades once we became energy independent we wouldn't have to focus all of our energy in the middle east. now we are and yet our energies are still focused there and we're still ignoring china. why do you think that is?

how troubled are you by these allegations and this evidence of alleged sexism and racism?
[president trump] is going to be telling nothing but lies and falsehoods, and he's going to be twisting reality, he proclaimed prior to the address. and at this point i've got to say, how stupid are americans who still believe there's a crisis on the southern border?
that a concurrent resolution is only used for like the soap box derby or

but we if we get a rise in crime, like we did in the 90s, it is going to swing back again. right now, we are living off of the law enforcement reforms that said policing matters, that incarceration matters, and we've gotten lazy, and the elites are back in the saddle, you know, and it's going to take a lot of thousands of more black lives lost to criminals who should be in jail before this gets turned around.

so, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. i am going to support him. before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and i think we are almost there, i would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. if we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. that's my recommendation.
ingraham: are you still parroting the - are you still parroting the - i'm not going to waste time on this, ok? because he, i think on three different occasions clarified what the media had said he said in charlotte. if you guys think you're going to win a presidential election by going back to charlottesville, it's just not going to happen. it's not going to happen. and as far as the economic recovery, this has been a recovery, including wage increases, that have been significant for blue-collar workers. all of the liberal economists, leo, had said --
they didn't have it. and they are afraid the guns are going to be turned

prager: well, i won't -- i don't know what adam's position is on this. but i think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong. i don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong.
jason chaffetz, contributor: well, i wish i could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and i hope it's sooner rather than later. but i think the democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the border patrol, wants to do. they had 60,000 people they apprehended in november coming across the border. and when the border patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.

ingraham: hey, leo, here's what i'll say. if donald trump, let's say doubles -- or does better, you say he's only going to get eight percent. i think he's going to get at least 15 percent to 20 percent if he does --

wallace: there were new questions this week about justice ginsburg after it turned out that she has missed arguments, a lot of us didn't know this, for the first time in her quarter century on the court.
wallace: all right. we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on romney's criticism of president trump. mike johnson sent this on facebook. when is he switching to the democratic party, because he obviously is no longer a republican? and jean caragher tweeted this, is he positioning himself to challenge president trump for the 2020 nomination?
carolla: yes, he gave me a jar of gefilte fish.

protesters initially gathered near the afl-cio building in washington, where union leaders placed the blame squarely on republicans.
sanders: well, they made some progress yesterday. the fact that they're sitting down at the table is some progress, in and of itself. but, they've got a long way to go. i mean, democrats set down, the first thing that one of the individuals from the democrats' side said in the meeting was, we're not here to make an agreement.
we didn't find out about the order until it was too late. perhaps if we had known sooner we would've had a chance to react, and save them.
sanders: it's by air, it's by land and it's by sea. it's all of the above. but one thing that you're forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border, and we have to protect it.
look, this is a time where voters are looking for a president who can lead us out of the days when it was just commonplace, or accepted to have these kinds of sexist and discriminatory attitudes. and, you know, right now, this is our chance to do something different.
tucker carlson: where do you think this leaves the president politically?
carolla: yes, i did. feed it to my cat.
wallace: so they're going to demand the president surrender?
at that point, it would be literally right on top of the biden
the decision comes after news from the centers for disease control and prevention that another person died of what appears to be a vaping-related respiratory disease. cdc research has associated vaping products that contained thc — or tetrahydrocannabinol, which is the active chemical in marijuana that causes a high — with the cases of lung-related illnesses.

william barr, attorney general: if he were to say, you know, go investigate somebody because -- and you sense it's because they're political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out.
what kind of country do you want to live in? a fair country. a decent country. a cohesive country. a country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. a country you might recognize when you're old.
sanders: whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful and we're looking at every option we can. this is something the president takes incredibly seriously, is very passionate about, and is not going to stop until he figures out the best way to make sure we're doing everything we can to make america safer and more secure.
members of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the democratic party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. in other words, functionally libertarian. they don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. somehow, they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. as far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.
the american people deserved to hear this riveting testimony, as well as the words of those who followed. but millions of viewers were robbed of this opportunity when one of the networks, msnbc, cut away from the press briefing right after president trump's remarks.

sens. elizabeth warren, d-mass.; bernie sanders, i-vt.; cory booker, d-n.j.; and kirsten gillibrand, d-n.y. – all considered 2020 democratic presidential contenders – have openly endorsed marijuana legalization or encouraged states to legalize. yet, they've all also used scientific arguments to justify their positions on climate change.
so the fact that, of all the people in the swamp -- i mean, granted, the
how concerned are you that the -- that the moderate lane, if you will, is getting so crowded that you could be leaving the -- the road to the nomination open to bernie sanders?
ingraham: my friday interview with president trump didn't just drive the impeachment news, we also broke major news on the strike against qasem soleimani.
you see, can't even agree on that.
chris cuomo, cnn host: but there are democrats who say you don't say good things about fidel castro. he destroyed freedoms in that country. he played -- picked winners and losers and killed them and put them in prison forever. you don't give them a pat on the back for anything.
tucker carlson: thousands of american troops are headed to the middle east tonight after iran's promise to retaliate for the death of general soleimani. but thousands of u.s. forces already deployed in iraq may soon be ordered out of the country. a lot going on tonight. foreign affairs correspondent benjamin hall is in jordan for us tonight. he joins us with more. benjamin?

it began with such promise, didn't it? in their desperate desire to oust our incumbent president, the democrat party produced more than 20 candidates, from political rookies to seasoned pros. they came from texas, new jersey, california, and places in between, all claiming to have what it took to dispatch their ultimate political nemesis, donald trump.

wallace: karl, he was talking there specifically about the president and -- and firing back at the policies of the president you worked for, bush 43. but where are we on syria right now? because the president said we're going to get out right away. then john bolton, the national security advisor, said, well, it depends on what happens with the kurds and isis. now we hear the pentagon is pulling equipment out. do you know where we are?

social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. the real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the american family is collapsing. nothing can be fixed before we fix that. yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. the idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. they refuse to consider it. questioning markets feels like apostasy.
dr. marc siegel, fox news channel medical correspondent: hi, tucker. we have two across the street in the biocontainment unit and 12 behind me quarantined in this hospital over here. and they're being carefully watched and as you said one more is coming in and i have a great privilege tonight to be joined by nurse shelly schwedhelm who is the director of bio preparedness here at nebraska medicine and runs this quarantine.

dana loesch: well, and it's -- yeah. and it's anti-science. you know, when you talk about castro and beto o'rourke and michael bloomberg and all of these other individuals that want to circumvent our second amendment rights, when they talk about criminal usage, we can't have a conversation about firearms unless we are also including, tucker, defensive gun usages. these are individuals who are in lawful possession of their firearms. and these numbers – defensive gun usage is, according to the cdc from barack obama when he commissioned this in 2013. it has therefore, it's -- i mean, it's been affirmed many times over, as you know, that they vastly outweigh instances of criminal possession. so, why -- my actual fear is that people find this bad, that there are good people out there who take the time to educate themselves, to learn about their firearm and to train, as we saw all those congregants at the church do just a week or so ago with jack harris. and then jack harris probably trained some of them as well. now, that's -- people should want to be able, they should be able to defend themselves. and we should encourage and empower people to do so instead of trying to shame them or smear them or malign their character. i find that disturbing.
killing bad guys when you need to kill them, but having economic warfare
my hope is, is that our withdraw from syria, i assume that the president's going to fulfill it, is done in an orderly fashion. but let's recognize our withdrawal empowers russia, it empowers iran, it empowers the syrians. and the ultimate result of it may be iranian-supported militias on the northern border of israel, which is anathema to our interests and our allies.
thankfully, the president recently held a news conference with several border patrol officials, giving them a chance to tell the public about the critical need for physical barriers at the border.
look, i think there are many people in the democratic party who are looking at mr. bloomberg because he has the resources to take on president trump. but the question in my judgment is his record. i mean, i am uncomfortable with his policies in new york. i understand he's apologized. i get that. i'm for forgiveness. but i am extremely dismayed at the information i read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.
donald trump's actions on china to hold them to account, ok, to -- and
with iran. i'm pleased to say that ofac expedited all the waivers, as i said they
but democratic presidential candidates have made it clear that if they take power in washington this fall, they will make the rest of the country every bit as inviting for criminals. watch this.
also in september, authorities involved in a drug-related arrest in banks county, georgia, said they had made the largest methamphetamine confiscation in the county's history. deputies seized 52.2 pounds of methamphetamine worth over $2.6 million, 6.9 pounds of cocaine worth $392,000, $22,000 in cash, and 10 firearms.
hanson: and that's why they're embarrassed.
of the civil rights movement you have seen plenty of violence before, but
but i'm just saying, of course, i think if you listen to joe biden, over hundreds of hours during this campaign answer questions about all the issues that he had to deal with in the white house, yes, i absolutely think he is quite capable.
clyburn was his suggestion that they would move to impeach in the house and
dershowitz: but nobody should forget that john bolton doesn't get the last word as to whether he testifies. he may want to testify.
senator mitch mcconnell's former chief of staff and president of cavalry
holmes: yes. i think, given what we saw with the kavanaugh hearings and everything else, you can -- you can say what you will, but this will be the first time that there is a seat that actually changes from a liberal held seat to a conservative held seat. and -- and if you think the kavanaugh hearings was divisive, wait until you get a load of this. i mean this will be the -- the granddaddy of them all in terms of supreme court battles.
some republicans don't want to wait.

in other words, grafton thomas gave us plenty of warning. the people in charge of protecting us just decided to ignore those warnings.
erica kasraie, iranian activist: thank you so much for having me. what i want the american people to know is that the majority of the iranian people view qasem soleimani as a terrorist who has terrorized the entire region, and they don't relate to the narrative that the left has been giving.
what driving the markets. i know that we got more signs of jobs growth on

wallace: good luck with getting him to back off on the tweets.
peter and daniel arbeeny have been extremely vocal about their grief and calling out the governor whenever possible. in october they staged a mock funeral of cuomo's leadership by putting over 6,000 photocopies of his book cover in a casket outside of the brooklyn nursing home where their father contracted coronavirus and died. in an email, they both say an apology would be the first step in helping their family start to heal, but they're not holding their breath.
terrell: no and here's the reason why laura and this is why herman will probably talk about abbreviated history. we have had economic growth for 121 months. 8 years of the obama administration plus and you can check it out, herman. unemployment was 10 percent when obama became president. it was 4.6. the only thing president trump has given us is $1 million deficit for this year. to my knowledge, there's only 7 african-americans i know who's going to vote for trump. herman cain, ben carson, kanye west, horace cooper, diamond and silk and candace owens. blacks are not going to support donald trump this year. he won't get less - more than 8 percent.
siegel: do you feel that here in the u.s., we're better off prepared.
mulvaney: we do that all the time with foreign policy.
wallace: congresswoman slotkin, do you like scotch?
nunes: and i don't think that there is. i think they're doing a really good job on a number of fronts.
plus, president trump takes incoming from both sides.
thanks to stories like this one, americans are warming shockingly to socialism. six months from now, a socialist could be the democratic nominee for president. in a few years, this could easily be a socialist country. what would that look like? well, of course it would be a disaster. socialism doesn't work. it never has worked, especially not in sprawling, diverse countries like this one. under a socialist regime, hundreds of millions of americans would see their lives get dramatically worse, while demagogic morons like alexandria ocasio-cortez would become vastly more powerful. that's socialism. you think america is stratified and unequal now? wait till we get a socialist system. it will be so much worse. that's coming, by the way and at high speed. why? because mindless chamber of commerce libertarianism has allowed greed and stupidity to flourish in corporate boardrooms and unless we rein that immediately, right now, we're going to lose the system that made this country great. as of tonight, america is sending thousands of additional troops to the middle east, but the iraqi government may soon say that they are not welcome there. so, what will happen next? we'll tell you as our coverage of the iran crisis continues.
carlson: shame on the judge. she should be impeached. she's corrupt. she's out of control and she has also muzzled roger stone, taken away his first amendment rights.
spunt (voice-over): minutes after president trump spoke to the crowd,
steal, he brought them to account. and he brought them to account because
so all of this becomes intertwined and related. and we need to get to the

carlson: and i think they will. adam and dennis. good to see both tonight. thank you.
ingraham: it was like a hot potato except you're dealing with nuclear, nuclear potential.
wallace: coming up, the shutdown standoff drags on.
this is the kind of stuff that we seek to find out in a voir dire. this judge should be outraged not at anyone other than that juror. and the fact that she decided that she wouldn't recuse herself when she has already prejudged the issue by saying, this jury acted with integrity and intelligence. how do you know, judge? have you spoken to that juror? do you know what was posted? do you know how she answered the question?
perhaps most shockingly, the left has willfully ignored studies like one published in 2017 in the american journal of psychology showing a strong connection between marijuana and future opioid use.

there were state hearings in august about the nursing home tragedy to which i was invited to testify. i was hoping my family's story would add to evidence piling up about the governor's negligence when it came to nursing homes.
patrick walsh: the democratic party is running on fumes (and trump knows it)
how much damage does that two of this government shutdown goes on for weeks, even into next month?
that during the impeachment, the president tweeted something during the

until january 19th at the soonest, the day before trump leaves office.
we need oversight of the who. we need to reform it, but we need to do so, we need to give it money with strings attached because it is times like this that we need to have an institution that the public can trust and the who doesn't deserve it and they haven't earned it and we shouldn't be funding it at the same levels.
plus, the south carolina primary is just days away. one of the top two candidates can't remember what office he is running for and the other defends dictators. that's next.
different than something about a policy over immigration or a policy on how
amendment and the president refuses to resign. if the house impeaches,
have you given any thought given how -- and i know you were concerned about how ugly the kavanaugh hearing is, how you avoid a repeat, particularly if it comes to the situation of donald trump replacing a woman who has become a liberal icon?
so the political penalties have gotten stiffer, but the penalties for violence and mayhem have almost disappeared in a lot of cases. but again, there's no constituency for this outside of like small pockets of affluence on the coast, like normal people are not for this. they never have been for it. so how do our leaders get away with it?
rachael bade, washington post reporter: she's clearly putting a positive spin on what a lot of democrats have privately said was a failed strategy. i mean she and chuck schumer, the minority leader in the senate set out to number one, try to get a commitment from mcconnell on witnesses, firsthand witnesses to have them testify in a senate trial. she also said she wanted to see a resolution about how the whole proceedings would be governed. she got neither of those.
looking very, very hard at that and dan scavino, the president's social

trump: dealing with these people is ridiculous. i don't know if they know how to make a deal.
in advance of the president's address to the nation from the oval office on tuesday night, the major television networks reportedly agonized over whether to even run the address, citing concerns that the speech could be used to promote untruths.
rep. devin nunes (r-ca): great to be with you, maria.
ingraham: i love that stage shot.
and even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe.
arroyo: it's like saying the democrats have too white a stage. they chose to knock out these candidates, not because they were hispanic or black, but because they weren't good enough to beat donald trump. that's why they're out. and laura, to prove there is no conspiracy among oscar voters, two of your favorite people got a best documentary nod. barack obama tweeted out glad to see american factory's oscar nod for best documentary. it's the kind of story we don't see often enough, and it's exactly why michelle and i hope to achieve with higher ground. barack and michelle obama nominated for their netflix documentary, imagine that.
and then the judge in the roger stone case attacked the show today. we will respond to her claims, just ahead.

prison today remains a lifetime achievement award for persistence in criminal offending. you have to work very hard to get yourself sentenced to prison, and yet, the elites are convinced and they're trying to persuade the rest of the world that america's endemic racism is willy-nilly throwing black people in prison and throwing away the keys. that is simply not the case.
the president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, said biden spokesman t.j. ducklo. he supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in americans' arms now.
and then it all kind of imploded, and all these diverse candidates showed that they had lack of gravitas, they were downright silly, they fell away, and now you've got this kind of old white guys' parade that's left over.
a more stringent measure that may indicate whether someone was actually high at the time of an accident suggests an increase of 84 percent.

it really does perplex me how you expect this to end when you tell the president of the united states, you get $1 for a wall when in the past democrats have appropriated billions for the wall. what are we supposed to do? just give in? he's not going to give in.

pete buttigieg (d), presidential candidate: well, it's very important for us to do well, and we're on the ground working to earn those good results here in nevada and we'll be campaigning hard for every vote in south carolina as well.
it's all uncertain and i don't know how it ends or resolves itself, he said. this isn't a matter of me not going to the movies or out to eat as much. i can't cut off my power or my cellphone or move out of my house.
ingraham: and she's contrary to some of the reporting, we'll get into that, she's not to going to get in either of those. so, that's a washington post reporter.
ok. i guess you think it was ok to speak with us.
jarrett: the prosecutors in the house had a chance to subpoena people like bolton or mick mulvaney or rudy giuliani. they didn't do it. the one subpoena they issued, they withdrew and now all of a sudden, nancy pelosi is trying to engage in a quid pro quo to extort the senate to do the job that the house was supposed to do. at the same time accusing the president of an impeachable quid pro quo. the hypocrisy and irony is, lost on no one.
steve bannon is here. steve, it's great to see you.

i asked hammond why he thinks the governor and his health department continue to stonewall his repeated requests for transparency even trying to dodge a lawsuit.
wallace: the attorney general, who's been a close ally of mr. trump, says he won't be bullied, while the president says he has the right to intervene even in cases like the one involving his long-time advisor, roger stone.

carlson: washington state isn't quite as screwed up as the state of california. it's beautiful in a lot of parts, a lot of nice people there.
wallace: and there's every sign that she is.
michael shear, new york times white house correspondent: we have still never seen what the president's legal defense of all of this is. we have seen his political defense, right? we have seen letters from pat cipollone, the white house counsel which are largely political arguments and we've seen the house members, the jim jordans of the world making largely political responses. we've never yet seen an actual legal defense.
why is a border wall immoral?
we will, because these democrats will do anything to defame the president
but the biggest lie of all is when politicians like obama claim, it's all ok. things are getting better. we're in a recovery. look away, there's nothing to see here.
and that's not an accident. once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. in many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. former speaker of the house john boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. his fellow republicans seem fine with that. oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us.
god bless america and save us from the murder of the middle class.
that's terrible, but the numbers of accidents are so small -- 35 in all of colorado in 2017, up from 19 in 2014 -- it's hard to draw conclusions. that deserves more study.
i understand all of that. and there's a lot of bad faith on both sides. why not make a deal?
should have the gentleman horowitz, who wrote the i.g. report.
the president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. and that's why since watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the justice department. and broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.
futures. and we begin in the middle east this morning.
rush limbaugh, conservative commentator: a gay guy, 37 years old, loves kissing his husband on debate stages. can you see trump have fun with that?
peter navarro, white house trade director: so tucker, there's a four part strategy that we're pursuing in trump time, which is to say as quickly as possible. you start with the personal protective equipment. this is the masks, and the gloves, the tyvek suits, things like that that our public healthcare workers need. we're making sure that we can secure those supplies tomorrow. h.h.s. is going out with an rfp to secure a half a billion face masks alone.
your mistakes cost us the lives of our family members, governor. but rest assured, we, the people will be strong in our fight for answers and accountability. and the more you try to silence us, the louder our voices will become.
and the only thing she's missing right now are oral arguments. she's participating by phone in the decision about what cases to take. and hopefully she will fully recover soon. her doctors say she's on course and she's cancer free.
barr: i cannot do my job here at the department with constant background commentary that undercuts me.
wallace: sir, i understand all that, i'm just asking you if he agrees to a compromise that includes other things that the democrats want, will the democrats give way and include money for the border barrier? yes or no?
mike pompeo: president trump's decision to remove qasem soleimani from the battlefield saved american lives. there's no doubt about that. he was actively plotting in the region to take action, a big action as he described it, that would've put dozens if not hundreds of american lives at risk. and last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.
newsom unveiled his new health-care plan hours after a protester interrupted his swearing-in ceremony to protest the murder of police cpl. ronil singh shortly after christmas day. the suspect in singh's killing is an illegal immigrant with several prior arrests, and republicans have charged that so-called sanctuary state policies, like the ones newsom has championed, contributed to the murder by prohibiting state police from cooperating with federal immigration officials.
that, you know, wasn't true. and most everybody knew it. but instead of
rove: look, here's the bottom line --
i realized that everyone could relate to piano music, but it just wasn't cool at the moment.
we said that on this show last week. today, during a hearing, jackson attacked us. and once again she lied as she did it.
wallace: josh, twitter is not a public utility, it's a private company. if
agenda moving as quickly as we can.
carlson: science. i mean, i could ask you -- i actually -- i am interested in science and watching it be trampled. what do you think of the whole gender thing?
mulvaney: -- on wednesday. and i don't know why.
trump: without a wall, you cannot have border security.
second thing is the treatment options. we've got three balls in the air on that. there's a drug called remdesivir which is administered intravenously, going through clinical trials. we're trying to secure the dosage for that. we're trying to develop oral antivirals in a very rapid time.
tucker carlson: according to secretary of state mike pompeo, meanwhile, soleimani was killed to forestall planned attacks on americans. but as he later conceded, those attacks would've occurred in the middle east not here in america.
proceed with a case and a trial. the senate doesn't convict without hearing
vivian zayas, co-founder of voices for seniors, an advocacy group founded after the unexpected death of her mother while receiving a few weeks of physical therapy at a west islip nursing home, says this situation is not about politics. for her, it's now about protecting those at risk. zayas wrote in an email:

carlson: most of what you're saying is intuitive. it's obvious. normal people, i think, know it instinctively. so why the change? was there a groundswell of support for letting people out of prison or not putting them in prison for killing police animals, for example, or rape? i mean, how did we get here?
mnuchin: no, that is still in it, maria. there is a real enforcement
in this country, there are more than 50 confirmed cases. today, the centers for disease control confirmed that a generalized outbreak is inevitable here, it's not a question of if this will happen, but when. officials warned americans to be ready for severe disruptions to their lives.

they did this, as you know. professor, thank you so much.
wallace: we'll ask pete buttigieg how he plans to stand out in the crowded center.
graham: well, i think it just plays out. what bothers me so much is that your next guests, chris coons, a great guy. we could sit down to make a deal with him wall, plus daca, wall plus tps. every democrat that i've worked with for about ten years now has agreed to funding for barriers/walls on obama's watch, on bush's watch, and all of a sudden, it's a bad thing on trump's watch.
they're just turning them around right through a turnstile. i think it's -
harman: also retired early in protest. so that's two.
well, of course, encouraging the intentional spread of the hiv virus. we're not joking by the way. we've got details after the break.
mo elleithee, contributor: i don't think so. i think most americans would agree that this is the president's shutdown and that the president is basically holding hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage over -- over this. and it's not just them. it's the people who contract with the federal government, people who aren't getting paid, people who are worried about paying the bills, people who are worried about paying their rent, people who may get stuck at airports. this is all -- these are the pressure points that are really going to move this.
goodstein: so i think, you know, you could show a lot of gaffes about joe biden. you could have done the same thing if you covered him decades ago. this is him.
attacking the president. you want the president to fight back.
this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday january 10, 2021. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
wallace: ok, but, wait a minute, but there are real people affected, right?
this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday, january 6, 2019. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
to make matters worse, many journalists – who are in complete denial about the legal and humanitarian crises at the border – accused the president of exaggerating the ongoing catastrophe. msnbc host joe scarborough, for instance, called americans stupid for believing that the crisis exists at all.
disqualify him from serving. i do think the president committed impeachable
look, we saw the president be presidential. i remember circumstances --
drone warrior: democrats, drones are not the solution to our border problem
ingraham: the d-word, diversity. this was supposedly, of course, the most racially, ethically, gender diverse field of candidates the country had ever seen, the world had ever seen. it was just what the left had been waiting for after four years of donald trump. surely alone the fact of diversity would bring back disaffected democrats and independents, and trump trump's booming the company.
he may not be wrong, by the way. i mean he -- it's the way that he
carlson: well, i mean, it's dysfunctional because it's crowded, and it's crowded because of their immigration policy and they won't admit that.
in the murder of the middle class i present unique ideas and policies for how to save america, the u.s. economy; create millions of middle class jobs; protect your family; and instantly turn this economic bust into the greatest boom of all time -- by giving the power and the money back to the people…and taking it away from government.
sanders: they're coming a number of ways. they're certainly -- i'm not disagreeing with you that they're coming through airports. i'm saying that they come by air, by land and by sea.
in the case of instex, we have warned instex that they may be -- depending
ingraham: it's friday, and that means it's time for friday follies. so male, so white becomes a new oscar slogan, a pair of royals sell themselves to hollywood, and the most inspiring moment on the hill this week. joining us now with all the details is raymond arroyo, fox news contributor. all right, raymond, years ago activists labeled the oscars so white for lack of diverse nominees, but now it's a new label?
there was a difference in the way they treated these, you may call them
people are concerned about the situation. i would say rightfully so. i'm concerned about the situation. c.d.c. is concerned about the situation.
here's what she said in 2017 about how long she will continue as a justice.
made. look at what actually happened that day, look at what happened during
take a look at this, sarah. federal tax refunds will be delayed. food stamps for 38 million americans will be cut. millions of people will lose rental assistance payments and union leaders say hundreds of tsa workers are already off the job because they can't afford to get to work. president trump thinks the border wall is worth all of that?
corke: now, 16 days into the shutdown, it is clear that despite increased face-to-face engagement, cooler heads haven't prevailed. in fact, the president turned up the heat, warning that he would consider using a national emergency to get his wall funding if democrats won't budge.
schumer: it's very hard to see how progress would be made unless they open up the government.
such an extreme event on wednesday it's not surprising we're looking at
we the families are disheartened at the constant stonewalling by governor cuomo but we will not be deterred in our effort to seek accountability for the preventable deaths of so many seniors. we are the heroes of this story and we will continue to challenge all the players until we gain justice and reform for our vulnerable elderly population.
different; if it's different now, if it's different about his advisors.
corke: quite a week here in washington. by the way, chris, the white house has asked the army corps of engineers to look into additional possible ways to help fund border security, including an examination of the 2018 february emergency supplemental. they say that would actually draw funds from disaster relief. we'll see if that happens -- chris.
mnuchin: and china is subject to sanctions, like everybody else.
wallace: the president said on friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from sarah sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. if he goes ahead and does that, what will house democrats like yourself do?
roberge: it's a straw argument. it's a straw argument. it's a terrible argument.
the reason that they give behind this is what's most troubling to me. so they argue that by treating hiv as a negative by criminalizing hiv, that you're stigmatizing people who are living with hiv. that's a ludicrous argument.
it should also be noted that this stage of the 2016 election, at the same stage, the gop actually itself had a more diverse field than the democrats have now. they had an african-american candidate, ben carson, joining two latino candidates, cruz and rubio. but remember, they are conservative, so they don't count in the democrats' been counting.
cicilline: it was a bad couple of weeks. so what does the president do? he shuts the government down and he's distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown.
last night at a town hall at cnn, sanders defended his many past comments praising fidel castro.
buttigieg: well, i think he's going to have to answer for that and speak to it.
wallace: ok. but let's talk about the effectiveness of it. brandon judd is the president of the national border patrol council. he's been a border patrol agent for 21 years. here's what he says.
ingraham: and then women who seem to be, as you said earlier, seem to be really happy that soleimani was taken out, we have a picture of that, as well.
wallace: since watergate, presidents have generally, perhaps not always, but generally stayed away from involvement in criminal investigations.
impeachment -- and i don't (ph) realize we were going to get into this
cain: didn't i ask you not to interrupt me?
goodstein: i am not lecturing, i am just saying --
ingraham: this is a game we can play all day long.
mind you, before the american crisis book, there was the poster the governor helped create (and sold) of a mountain representing the curve on a graph of all the cases (and deaths) in new york.

ingraham: have you actually taken the time to examine the top 4 democrat 2020 contenders? it's an absolute train wreck. now last night, we reminded you that even barack obama is wondering what's going on here, warning about the party's lurch to the left. so why did he feel the need to speak out? well, because the so called moderates in the top tier, buttigieg and biden are sounding like this.

question for you, congresswoman slotkin, are the democrats, particularly in the house, too anti-trump?

more recently here in new york, with covid-19 numbers rising at an alarming rate, the governor's office has suggested they may use the javits center again in case the hospitals get overwhelmed. in the spring, nursing home residents recovering from the illness were sent back to virus ravaged elder care facilities instead of being transported to the javits center. the governor has never been pressed on why they were not used more efficiently to help stop the wildfire of covid-19 from killing seniors.
kasraie: -- when we go to school, right? in iran, children, their pledge of allegiance is saying death to america and death to israel. so in iran, children are forced to chant death to america and death to israel. so that kind of indoctrination starts very young. and so what you see in this picture is children who are being forced to mourn. and so this is the regime's propaganda that they circulate in social media.
wallace: and just, finally, and i got about 30 seconds left, if you got donald trump -- and again, this is if -- you have donald trump replacing a liberal icon like ruth bader ginsburg, isn't that a formula for -- i mean, doesn't that make the kavanaugh hearings look like a tea party?
in 2014, dallas had only 116 homicides this year after the far left, john creuzot promise not to prosecute thefts valued at less than 750 bucks. the murder rate went up to over 200.

john kerry, former secretary of state: yes. obviously, he could. i mean he almost did. it's a sad day when the united states of america has to rely on the decision of a regime that we neither like nor trust to have them be the ones who behave somehow in a way that saves donald trump from his own decision.
where does the pressure come and is going to be a surrender by one side to the other? are they going to sort of lay down the instruments of war? or is there going to be a compromise that involves something that the president ends up giving to democrats, whether it's on daca, the dreamers, people with temporary protected status,, whatever?
brazile: well, the race is far from over. and i know everyone is focused on the four states that ultimately help us to winnow the field.
slotkin: i mean, for me, it's mission, right? you have a mission. and when you're serving in the cia or military, you wake up every day, you know what you're doing and why you're doing it. and i think it's no different in congress. some people have treated it as if they don't have a mission, that they're there for themselves, they're show horses, whatever. i think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing.
maybe. who cares? talk about missing the point. try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. the life is gone. passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. do you want that for your kids? of course not. then why are our leaders pushing it on us? you know the reason. because they don't care about us.

buttigieg: actually prepared to do something on gun violence.
we have heard over and over again from democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to president trump? why won't any of his people stand up to president trump? then bill barr does that with a brush back pitch that i think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.
now, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden republicans who have forgotten who they represent. the year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies.
the goal for america is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. it's happiness. there are a lot of ingredients in being happy: dignity. purpose. self-control. independence. above all, deep relationships with other people. those are the things that you want for your children. they're what our leaders should want for us, and would want if they cared.

williams: i think it's up to mueller. it's up to mueller to say this is, one, provable and part of my ultimate report. you do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation. and this is unprecedented. the fbi, as you said, going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn, a manchurian candidate, for the russians. but what we can say, and i -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. michael cohen is not going to testify before congress. i think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. and right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 pennsylvania avenue. there something going on.

wallace: if i may just press, why is a wall immoral?
what do i mean? they refuse to move even a milimeter toward a common sense comprise with this president. a year ago they were willing to give him $25 billion for a wall. they were willing to do that until schumer pulled it from the table. today, they're can't come up with a measly $5 billion? think of all the waste, fraud and abuse in this town that they could trim to come up with $5 billion.

rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., speaker of the house: we are not doing a wall. does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? the wall, in my view, is an immorality. it is, again, a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the american people. but it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president.
wallace: and does he really think he has --
hanson: that's not the first time, laura. remember that during our discussions of getting out of the iran deal, he was meeting in a shadow capacity in paris with iranian officials, in a way that would weaken our ability to protect our interests and get out of that flawed deal. and it's part of a larger narrative. they're really angry about the soleimani death. but donald trump was very deliberate. he explained what happened. he didn't go to the white house correspondents dinner like obama did and joke about predator assassination.
ingraham: all right. leo. those are - no, those aren't facts. that's a guess or a projection. i don't want to quibble with words on a friday night. it's a long week but i'm just teasing herman. so leo says it's not going to move any voters at all, this economy, because it was kind of it's always been growing.
what? we're not going to oppose boycotts of israel because trump wants to do a deal on the border wall? how is that governing in a mature way? i'm sure the new anti-semitic wing of the new democratic party was thrilled about this development in the senate. but most americans are not.

there was truth in this. but it wasn't the whole story. how do we know? because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. in many ways, rural america now looks a lot like detroit.
ever since william barr became attorney general, critics have complained he acts more like the president's personal lawyer than the nation's top law enforcement officer. but this week, barr said mr. trump's comments and tweets about criminal cases make it impossible for him to do his job.
i've never heard a republican candidate or any republican officeholders say, you know, that's just a flat out lie actually. we have the numbers, you're wrong. why do they never stand up for simple law and order?

or maybe not. after months of uninspiring stump speeches and lackluster debate performances, it became pretty clear, didn't it, that most of the candidates were duds. and starting in december, the diverse field started to vanish faster than a jamie lee curtis film. first kamala, as in harris, bowed out.

there was a motion to dismiss in the clinton impeachment trial. it failed, because there were nearly a dozen felony offenses identified as abuse of power by the independent counsel ken starr. here, there are no felony offenses. there are no high crimes and misdemeanors. they talked ad nauseum about extortion and bribery and in the end, they realized, there was no evidence for that. so, they conjured this wonderfully amorphous term, abuse of power. and you know i agree there ought to be and there probably will be a motion to dismiss and it should be seriously considered and voted upon.
and then finally, i think this is really important that california zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the bay area, or la. so people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in california.

tucker carlson: well, if you can remember that far back during president barack obama's second term, republican leaders in the congress made a big show of opposing the obama administration's refugee policy. obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled syria's civil war in the united states and at the time 25 republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. for example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. often, it's impossible. some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be syrian. that was true for sure in europe with the refugees. some of them might be islamic extremists. but terrorism was not the only worry they had. america's middle class is in decline. we already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. the last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. that's just true. and anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. as with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. so, before she became the most anti-american member of congress, ilhan omar was a refugee. so, at the time the republican governors got their wish and president trump won the 2016 election.
guy benson, fox news radio: well, first, i would just say to donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. i would also note, that president obama did make public comments about the hillary clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from rodney king, right? so there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.

and, you know, one of the reasons why i'm seeing a lot of folks from the republican party or formally from the republican party ready to cross over is that they can no longer look their children in the eye and explain the behavior of the current president of the united states.
and if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? he waited to the lame duck. why? because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. his foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. the gentleman heading the isis effort resigned.
stier: well, that's right, even though u.s. taxpayers cover about almost half the bill for the who, a $2 billion a year who budget, we have very little say over what they do, and they have elections. different countries have voted to support mugabe. there's been a corruption at the who before mugabe.

when the nursing home mandate was first issued, the society for post-acute and long-term care medicine, known as amda, had sent out a warning email stating that cuomo's order admitting infected patients posed a clear and present danger to nursing home residents. jeffrey n. nichols, who serves on the executive committee of the group, said, the effect of that order was to contribute to the thousands of deaths.

harman: no, it wasn't foolish. i -- she may look frail, but she's -- she's an iron maiden. she is a -- i knew her first when she was a litigator in the '70s and she's always been a petite woman whose voice sometimes wobbles, but her mind is strong and it's her call. and she wears that diva t-shirt in the gym at the -- at the supreme court and she's a trailblazer for women. i mean -- and she'll know when it's time. she's not going to hang on if she can't function fully in the job.

wallace: and then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on super tuesday you face another centrist candidate in mayor mike bloomberg. and over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as i discussed with kellyanne conway, a big story in the washington post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.
wallace: i understand, but if the white house -- if the fbi found evidence that the president was an ongoing manchurian candidate, an agent for the russians, you don't think that that -- they -- they'd just sit on that and --
but again, going back to friday, the president meant what he said, that he is prepared to fight for the wall, to continue the shutdown for months or even years?

on friday, as it goes into the 21st day, if it does, the shutdown would be the longest in history, midnight friday. will we, a week from today, will the shutdown still be going on? and when it ends, which side is going to be seen as winning?
victor davis hanson, senior fellow, hoover institution: well, i think they're embarrassed laura, because it wasn't just appeasement but they had an actual tapestry of a new middle east in which iran would balance all of our traditional allies, israel and the moderate gulf regimes and we would give them cash and they would bank it, they would get more technological information in exchange for that. they would have peace for our time and john kerry and barack obama could wave a paper and say, we've got an agreement.
just because something doesn't work doesn't mean that we end it, he replies. doesn't mean we quit.

ingraham: all right, thanks for being with us. so should democrats be worried about the african-american vote? interesting. a new wallstreet journal piece asks, biden, sanders and warren would say these new minority jobs fell like manna from heaven. the workers getting them may credit the president. here to debate, it's herman cain, former gop presidential candidate and leo terrell, civil rights attorney. leo.

mike pompeo, secretary of state: the age of self-inflicted american shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.
cuomo does get kid-glove treatment from some in the media (especially when he does quick-hit appearances on national tv) but not from the capitol press corps reporters who cover him on a daily basis. he and his p.r. staff are generally awful to deal with, so there is little love lost. if they don't ask about the nursing home issue more often, it's probably because they know they won't get straight answers and they have dozens of other issues to cover. they might be pushing behind the scenes, and many reporters have filed foil requests similar to mine.
i believe he has to have some of the house people, like lee zeldin and mark

douglas macgregor: look. he walked into a room at mar-a-lago with senators rubio and graham, secretary of state pompeo, national security advisor o'brien, the secretary of defense esper, and i assume jared kushner. you're talking about a room full of neo-cons. you're talking about the people that you've been discussing that have been urging war with iran forever. they seem to have persuaded him that this airstrike made sense and that we should take the opportunity and do it. and publicly he's said that. i think it was probably unnecessary for the reasons that i've already outlined. this is not going to do anything for us strategically. as far as sending the message is concerned, his deputy has already taken over. the deputy has been with him since '97. this is going to stiffen resolve against us, and it's going to make any attempt to reach any arrangement with iran virtually impossible. so, from that standpoint, i don't think it made a lot of sense. it's not necessarily helping us and what the president says he wants to achieve in the persian gulf with iran.
for eight years, california has built a foundation of rock, newsom said. our job now is not to rest on that foundation. it is to build our house upon it.

ingraham: well, it's not even jfk, that's not obama's party. that's our whole point. obama is saying to himself and has said publicly, yes, you know you can't - you can't just like basically drum everyone else out of the party because they don't sign on to the aoc plus 3 agenda. so moving forward to next week an impeachment, eric, your dad's going to be out of the country at davos. big economic forum, world leaders, financial leaders, business types. will he be watching this? be honest. i know you're always honest but is he going to be watching the greatest clips, the greatest hits at the end of the day?
he said, you can basically xerox the description of male minorities between the ages of 16 and 25, and hand it over to the cops.

he got all the major networks to carry his address, galvanizing the attention of the entire country. and he accomplished something else: he got house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer, two of the least popular politicians in the nation, to respond to him -- on his terms.
carlson: well, that's exactly it. it's not that anyone i think in the united states has particular affection for iran or trust in its government, much, much less the revolutionary guard or the kurds forces. of course not.
slotkin: sure. well, the perfect example is the government shutdown right now. we have the basis of a deal, right? both sides are saying they care about border security. they believe in national security. start having a real negotiation about border security, border forces, more technology at the border, fencing if we needed it in some areas. it doesn't just have to be a wall. that's the essence of a negotiation.
mitch mcconnell, what do you think are the prospects that the senate, if
i think it was an unforced error. and he was elected to represent the state of utah to solve problems. this didn't solve a problem, it created a problem. i think it was an unforced error.

carlson: so you started on the new york city force, at the police department when new york was dangerous. you took over running the department when it had become safer, it was still safer after you left and now you're seeing it move in the opposite direction. it almost seems like we know what to do to make the city safe, but we're not doing it on purpose.
millions of taxpayer dollars went into running these operations along with doctors and staff at the ready. they instead went empty while nursing homes were packed with patients.

carlson: there's an awful lot of news tonight, but we want to pause and acknowledge something that's happened in the democratic presidential race. julian castro is out.
after taking control of the world health organization, tedros promptly tried to appoint robert mugabe, the murderous dictator of zimbabwe as an international goodwill ambassador for public health, if you can believe that.
alan what happens - well, i was going to say it this way, the articles of impeachment arrive in the senate. couldn't and shouldn't, this goes back to my advice i'm going to give and i'm going to throw it out to you. couldn't mitch mcconnell dispose of this travesty right off the bat? i think this even setting a precedent for these two articles of impeachment abuse the process and obstruction, obstruction for not going to court, abuse of process on these nebulous flawed grounds is ridiculous. i would either dismiss it or decide it immediately. i wouldn't entertain this nonsense at all. thoughts.
right now overflowing garbage cans on the mall is not exactly -- i drove past it this morning. it's not exactly like a scene from a mad max movie out there. but as time goes by, i think those are the pressure points. and you can see a lot of senators get weak in the knees about it.

let's get the latest now from kevin corke live at the white house -- kevin.
whitaker: i think there's a lot of excitement, especially from the media that's going to cover this. they want fireworks. they want folks arguing. they want a lot of witnesses and a lot of controversy. mitch mcconnell doesn't want that. a lot of the senators on both sides quite frankly don't want that. they don't - you know they have a constituency back home that they need to be impressive to and to get re-elected. but fundamentally, the democrats from the house have the burden of persuasion and if they can't prove their case in their initial 24 or so hours that they get, i don't expect that there's going to be an appetite for most senators to go further with documents or witnesses.
adviser to the president ivanka trump, attorney general william barr and others on friday discussed ways to combat human trafficking at the white house summit on human trafficking.
i didn't get elected to have nancy pelosi play games, which is all she's
but first, republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. you'd have to be a fool to worship it. our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. we do not exist to serve markets. just the opposite. any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. a system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.
the drugs are appearing across the country. in minnesota in september, a drug task force seized over 170 pounds of methamphetamine, with authorities saying it was the largest single meth bust in the state's history. the estimated street value was $7.75 million.

smith: well, i mean if you look at what happened - if you look at the sunset clauses meaning the different provisions built into the deal that were set to expire sometime after barack obama left the white house, that's very clear. it tells you what they were doing. they were passing it on to the next administration.
wave american flags, and all have signs of donald trump being a superhero,

that's a cliche the democratic and republican political animals use all the time, a firewall that will give him momentum going into super tuesday to make or break contest. at least that was the plan. at this point, it's not even clear biden knows what office he is running for.

wallace: i love the fact that this is a fight between president trump and nancy pelosi. and poor senator mcconnell, you're probably sitting out there with your lovely wife, elaine chao, watching this and suddenly he gets dragged into this fight.

should be scaled back at all. he needs to be robust with it, simply because
the only crisis here is one that's been created by the president's abrupt change in position at the end of last year in the last days of a republican-controlled congress.
but there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the president wants.
aishah hasnie, fox news correspondent: live from america's news headquarters, i'm aishah hasnie. former new york congressman chris collins has been sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading. collins' attorneys were looking to avoid prison time and push for probation, but earlier today a federal judge rejected their pleas. he must surrender to the federal bureau of prisons on march 17th. the republican was the first sitting member of congress to endorse president trump. he resigned from office in september. a mysterious and deadly virus has led to screening of airline passengers arriving at three u.s. airports from wuhan, china, the epicenter of the outbreak. two people have died and dozens are ill with pneumonia-like symptoms. the screenings start tonight at new york's jfk airport and tomorrow at los angeles and san francisco. i'm aishah hasnie. now back to the ingraham angle.
kasraie: well, with all due respect to my friends on the left, i feel like, since president trump has been elected, he can do no right. they have blamed him for everything. and frankly, i think it is time for us to have genuine discussions and debates. and i felt like, for me, the reason i even made that video was because a lot of my friends were calling me and were like, hey, what you think about what is going on? and what is your opinion? and i just made a little video because i just wanted my friends did on my network, the iranian and people are happy. and i was genuinely just nauseated. why do we have sympathy for a terrorist, when i'm getting videos and pictures from people inside iran that are happy?
more jobs under president trump than ever created before.
what i will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. and when you look at the way that latino voters here in nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat donald trump. we are ready to go out and have that conversation.
coons: i'm keeping an open mind. we had a very constructive meeting this past week. i did ask him a number of questions right along those lines and will ask them again in the public confirmation hearing. i would need a firm commitment that he would not allow any interference in the mueller investigation, he will allow it to reach its conclusion and he will release the report to the public.
carlson: it seems that -- no, we don't. peter navarro, thanks so much.
election, but we can't play into the hands of these people. we have to have
bannon: tell nancy pelosi -- hey, tell nancy pelosi, when you deliver it,
d'souza: part of the reason why warren has plummeted, i think, is because there's a fakery to her. the insincerity of even her dance moves are just so nausea inducing.
harf: i actually hope that democrats get something like daca out of this. i don't want this to keep going on. but, you're right, the more real people that feel this, people that can't pay rent, if it goes on till the state of the union, i think that's insane. that is crazy.

you know, this is -- the only good thing here is, is that after obama campaigned with platitudes like that, he actually got into the white house and failed. at this point, we can have the guy fail before he gets real power.

buttigieg: well, here's my generational -- or general election experience on this. you know, i came out during a general election in south bend. and this was at a time when mike pence was the governor of indiana. and we didn't know what would happen.
i can relate, trump told reporters this weekend. and i'm sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. they always do. and they'll make adjustments. people understand exactly what's going on. many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what i'm doing.

chuck, as i discussed with kellyanne, under article two, the president has tremendous powers to oversee the justice department and specifically criminal investigations. so how do you answer mark?

ingraham: victor, it is quite something is it not to hear this man described as some type of revered military figure like, he's just a scholar at iran's version of the hoover institution, victor, there you have it. and by any means necessary, must resist president trump.
on march 18, the governor reassured everyone there would not be a shelter-in-place order for new york. he told people to go about your life and do not be afraid.
j.d. vance: well, i think one thing they're thinking is that just as the past two american presidencies have been bogged down in the middle east in various ways this conflict risks escalating in a way that makes america focus on the middle east for yet another few years, maybe another 10 years even as the chinese grow in military might and economic power. and we know of course that they're planting various infrastructure and economic institutions all over africa, all over asia, that their entire economy is growing and flourishing and yet again we risk focusing on this small region of the world that is obviously important but not nearly as important as our biggest geopolitical rival continuing to gain strength and power.
congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. thanks very much for
ingraham: iran's supreme leader -- i don't like saying that, but i said it -- today, made a rare appearance in public to call trump a clown who can't be trusted, and praised the missile strikes against u.s. forces. the comments came two weeks after president trump ordered that killing of qasem soleimani via air strike, and in the days since, of course, democrats and the media have sworn up and down that this was ill-advised and had only united iran. is that really the case? we recently spoke to iranian-american activist erica kasraie, whose viral video explaining how actual iranian citizens feel has amassed nearly 5.6 million views. we started by asking her to respond to this from some in the media.
stier: good to see you, tucker.

the president at the last moment changed his mind and that deal fell apart. so, we are trying to isolate the disagreement. so, we passed again the senate approved version that -- it was the republican path forward. that passed the house in a bipartisan way with republicans and democrats. we sent that to the senate.

cicilline: but let's use technology, let's use drones, let's use satellites, let's do cargo inspections, which aren't happening. let's do things that will actually secure the border.
jarrett: well, we'll wait and see.
wallace: (voice over): folds shares his creative process in this memoir. the title refers to a childhood dream where he spread joy by catching lightning bugs for others.
wallace: finally, i've got less than a minute, finally, freshman congresswoman rashida tlaib -- and i know you were expecting this question -- of michigan said this on thursday night.
we're seeing an explosion, said mike stuart, u.s. attorney for the southern district of west virginia, according to the washington times. we have all hands on deck in fighting the opioids crisis — the height of that might have been two years ago. it's important right now that we're ready and tackling the meth crisis that's going to happen, and that we're hitting the cocaine crisis.

corporate tax cuts are also popular in washington, and romney is strongly on board with those, too. his piece throws a rare compliment to trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago.
wallace: what you think about the report in the new york times that in 2017, the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the united states was a russian agent?
fleischer: it's just such a joke on its face because what they're trying to pretend is as if they're a real court of law and they're not. if the founders wanted to put this in a real court of law for a real trial, they would have done so. then impeachment would have gone to a jury. it's not, it's going to a political body. it's gone to the house and now it's gone to the senate. the framers intended it to be political because they want politicians who are accountable to the people to make these final decisions about whether you overthrow the people's determination from an election so stop pretending this is a court of law. if it's a court of law, why are they reading newspaper articles about it? why are they appearing on tv? jurors are not supposed to read articles about the cases in which they're hearing. so aren't all those democrats who read newspaper stories biasing themselves? no, because it's not a real trial and none of us should look at it the way, we do and the democrats should stop this silly game. no one 's buying it.
the sweeping proposal appeared destined to push california -- already one of the nation's most liberal states -- even further to the left, as progressive democrats there won a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature in november and control all statewide offices.

wallace: we asked you for questions for the panel and on the president's thought about declaring a national emergency we got this tweet from greg engle. by declaring a national emergency, will this open the door for future -- future presidents to do the same over topics such as climate change, health care, or even gun control laws because of mass shootings? is this really a national emergency or just fulfilling a campaign pledge?
tucker carlson: as well as in the campaign against isis. though he was little known to the american public, soleimani was among the most famous living figures in iran and also among the most powerful. according to some accounts, second only to the supreme leader of that country. the iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge against the u.s. in response to his death. now whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. but it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs we could be engaged in a conflict, a real conflict, with iran. from iran's perspective we're already there. if iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff, for example, would you consider it an act of war? you would. so, what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've seen in syria, it was a pivot point. neo-cons in washington understood that immediately. congratulations to all involved in eliminating qasem soleimani, tweeted disgraced former national security advisor john bolton. hope this is the first step to regime change in tehran. that of course has been the neo-con objective all along. the president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that regime change and war are not the point at all.

rep. lee zeldin, r-n.y.: a lot of miscalculation. we saw it really since last fall, when they started this impeachment push and there was this rush, it was tripping over herself so desperate to rush, it's so urgent that we couldn't even provide fairness. we couldn't even provide due process to the president.

tucker carlson: thank you. for more than 100 years the boeing company has led international aviation. to this day it's measured by dollar amounts. boeing remains america's single largest foreign exporter. but now like so many american institutions, boeing is in trouble. last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. there's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. production is being suspended. in business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. how did it happen? well, at least part of the responsibility lies with ceo dennis muilenburg who has been in charge at boeing since 2015. fittingly, muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. someone in corporate america is finally being held accountable for screwing up. but before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. according to recent sec filings, muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. that's his punishment. and by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. here's some context for how much money that is. a rank and file employee at boeing might make $60,000 a year. that's a decent salary in many places. it would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced dennis muilenburg is getting in his severance package.

today we say to this president, 'grow up, do your job, end this shutdown,' sanders said.

the mandate forces individuals to purchase health care coverage or pay a fee that the supreme court described in 2012 as a tax, rather than a penalty that would have run afoul of congress' authority under the commerce clause of the constitution. last month, though, a federal judge in texas ruled the individual mandate no longer was a constitutional exercise of congress' taxing power because republicans had passed legislation eliminating the tax entirely -- a move, the judge said, that rendered the entire health-care law unworkable.

for an added bonus, they believe this stalemate with the shutdown furnishes them with another political weapon to further their impeachment agenda. trump's threat to end the shutdown by declaring a national emergency and building the wall himself could hasten the democrats' ultimate desired end -- impeachment.
graham: they should have thought of that before they changed the rules. they try to destroy conservative judges. i voted for sotomayor and kagan understanding what i was getting. so this decision by reid and schumer may come back to haunt them, but i am dead set on making sure it is a conservative nominee.

there was a very interesting moment on friday because president trump came out to the rose garden after his meeting with nancy pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on democrats who want to impeach.

the good news for joe biden is he says is, don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. and he'd be running against somebody who thinks that frederick douglass has a great future, who thinks that an american invented the wheel, who cannot pronounce the word anonymous or origin.
wallace: but you could open those eight other agencies.

ingraham: i will repeat that the best headline of all time, i think, was the headline in the new york times, the husband formally known as prince.
with his inner circle shrinking, a push is underway to remove him from
coming up, we bid adieu to someone who gave us great joy. stay there.
something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. donald trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the white house. does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying america? those are open questions.
working rank-and-file capitol police did not have better leadership.
trump: i haven't done it yet. i may do it. if this doesn't work out, probably i will do it. i would almost say definitely.
ingraham: well, the clinton impeachment resolution included a provision for a motion to dismiss before the witness vote took place. now it ultimately failed but it was an important point. i mean, it's a really weird thing like if they think it's absolutely going to be defeated so what, just put it in anyway.
we actually sanctioned some of their shipping companies that were involved
coming from a source close to pence -- president trump never reached out to
administration, confirming his nominees, getting to work.
buttigieg: for a representative of this white house to speak about misogyny, to speak about sexism, to speak about racism is comical. and, you're right, i think it amounts to trolling.
jarrett: romney belongs to the romney party.
perino: that's when you know you're in real trouble. if you say something like that and like -- it's like if a tree falls in a forest, like if you say something like that on a debate stage and everyone goes, yes, well, it's just like helium. okay.
maryland democratic sens. benjamin cardin and chris van hollen also spoke to the crowd, as did connecticut democratic sen. richard blumenthal.
wallace: policy is different than criminal cases. policy is different than criminal cases.
mean, this is just another misstep.
that is something that we continue to focus on. and we look forward to a
people, but the audience is the world. they're watching on the streets of taipei. they're watching in hong kong.
peter navarro is one of the point men in the administration on coronavirus. he's the white house trade adviser, and he joins us now for answers. peter, thanks so much for coming on.
it's embarrassing to see what they say about what to do with china. look at
mornings with maria, 6 a.m. et: special guests include: neil dhar, partner and head of financial services at pwc; marta tellado, president and ceo of consumer reports; newt gingrich, former house speaker; u.s. rep. henry cuellar, d-texas.
well, guess who those homicide victims are overwhelmingly? black.
ingraham: bernie sanders, dinesh, he says he's the guy. check it out.
corke: so, while the president stays here and then heads to camp david, remaining in washington will be vice president mike pence. in fact, he will be here conducting yet another working discussion with congressional democrats who, of course, are here with their staffers hoping to find a way, chris, to end the shutdown.
said, we're going to stop this.
ingraham: yes, it may - plays well at the university cafeteria perhaps but the faculty room.
unidentified female: for me, its mission. and when you are serving in the cia and the military, you wake up everyday and you know what you're doing and why you're doing it, and i think it's no different in congress.
white house was you got to let trump be trump, let trump be trump.
mnuchin: i know it is going through the senate committees now. we expect

wallace: ok, no, no, this, no, we need shouting. ok, i want to move on.
the shutdown, which enters its 21st day friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.

the president to do, cut off aid to ukraine --
mills: it's a joke. it's a joke. i mean, i think the real question is, why do we still have troops there? so you see the baghdad embassy protests. and to be clear, this is not just an embassy. this is a fortress. it's been a fortress since we took out saddam in 2003 and american troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages.
rove: i think the american people are saying a pox on both your houses.

donna brazile, former dnc chair: has president trump learned in any lesson over the last couple of months? he's on a retribution tour. he's on a revenge tour.
siegel: we met up with deputy secretary of homeland security, ken cuccinelli at customs. he's a key member of the president's coronavirus task force.
bartiromo: let me move on to china, because you are planning a big event

reacting. great to talk with you this morning. thanks so much.
and once americans know that, i have every expectation that mr. trump will
while the democrats strain to squeeze the last bit of political juice from this shutdown, the president is doing the right thing. he is focused on the security and the sovereignty of the american people and their prosperity. it is a posture that is good policy, but in time it's going to prove to be good politics as well.
internalizing all this will not be easy for republican leaders. they'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. they'll likely lose donors in the process. they'll be criticized. libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism.

wallace: no, they get really great because you're talking about a brokered convention, which all of us have been looking towards for our entire political lives.
wallace: what does he think is his authority to get involved in criminal cases under article ii?

of my time there, all i ever heard from some of the real devotees in the
senator, welcome back to fox news sunday.
think he wants them to say.
even after president trump leaves office?
holmes: well, it's -- i think this is important to know because at that point he had an obligation to do a deal with an administration that didn't see eye to eye with his conference. that is precisely the role that chuck schumer and nancy pelosi find themselves in at this particular juncture. and instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government, nancy pelosi's telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up -- open up the government and fund the wall. that's ridiculous.
the president is not going to give in. no wall, no deal, but he's ready to deal. and your next guest i am sure would provide funding for a barrier where it made sense if he could get something for it.
because the america first policies are resonating.
a national academies of sciences, engineering and medicine study found there is substantial evidence linking cannabis smoking and chronic bronchitis, development of schizophrenia and other psychoses.
sad, i was embarrassed, i was frustrated. and i still am trying to figure
in both instances, the communities erupted because they were concerned about overzealous policing and what happened in those cases. that's what they got involved.
capitol, with these secretive interviews, the only one that's not released
wallace: no, but i'm not asking you that. i'm asking you --
harman: it's not a national emergency. it is fulfilling a campaign pledge. the wall is a primal scream. in your conversation with -- your very good conversation just before with lindsey graham and chris coons, both of them made clear that there are ways that congress can make a deal. that's the right answer. and i'm going to get in a fight with josh because i think that mitch mcconnell, his old boss, who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called playing the long ball, is bunting here and he could, if he chose to, rouse a veto proof majority in the senate to pass what the senate passed in the last senate, which is the collection of crs and then just leave one, that would be the department of homeland security bill, with a shorter time frame to negotiate, have lindsay and, as far as i'm concerned, chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on tv, which maybe trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it.
with two children and a mortgage, child support and alimony payments, atkinson said he has taken out a personal loan to cover two paychecks, just to be safe. but if the shutdown stretches into february, he may need to take out another.
it's sort of the same subject is racism. as racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well.
you saw a memo over the weekend saying that they wouldn't move until the
i'm stating this because thousands of families went through the same tragic process.
mnuchin: no, maria, that is not true.
wallace: but special interest aliens are just people who come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist. they're not terrorists themselves. and the state department says that there is, quote, their words: no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from mexico.
why is mitch mcconnell completely absent from these negotiations? it's because he doesn't really know what the president will accept.
colorado youth have an 85 percent higher marijuana use rate than the rest of the country, he says in my new video on marijuana legalization.
fda commissioner dr. stephen hahn spoke with me about this on siriusxm's doctor radio this week and stated that he believes the second shot must be given at the predetermined studied interval under the terms of the emergency use authorization for the two vaccines.
cuccinelli: well, there's a difference of course with japan and korea and iran. iran is an enemy state and it's hard to interact there.
kasraie: yes, this is two women who are celebrating. they put this video out on social media. these are the videos that, unfortunately, our friends on the left haven't had access to and refuse to show --
the president spoke to fox news in texas, on the banks of the rio grande, where he visited the border region to argue that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the united states. back in washington, democrats in the senate on thursday failed to proceed with house-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border-wall money.

michael bloomberg, d-former new york mayor, presidential candidate: i'm not buying anymore. i'm doing exactly the same thing they are doing, except that i'm using my own money.
at one point, he seemingly blamed the seniors themselves: older people, vulnerable people, are going to die from this virus. that is going to happen. despite whatever you do.
i don't want to speak for the president. i don't want to lock him in, but i'm confident what i just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the white house. and a lot of democrats -- and i'm just so frustrated -- we can't get in a room and hammer it out.
wallace: i didn't say he didn't. i'm saying, what does he think is his authority?
sanders: you don't get -- it's not a quiet -- truth is truth. all right.
regime to actually take these sanctions away?
so dana, you keep hearing from democrats, this grave disappointment in their own primary electorate suggesting that they're bigots for supporting, i guess, biden and bernie, what do you make of that?
san francisco, for example, facing an epidemic of shoplifting and car robberies, it has made life unbearable for many taxpayers. we've got a series on that running next week, which you won't want to miss.
the contrast should be glaring for anyone who watched. the president was really sober -- he genuinely believes that a wall is needed as part of a larger border security policy. that's what he won on. democrats don't give a damn about securing the border. for them this is all about scoring political points and of course, 2020.
levine: when you have to change a magazine --
and that's it for today. have a great week and we'll see you next fox news sunday.
thank you, all, panel. see you next sunday.
that -- i mean one person last night said to me, everything's on the table.
he has said over the weekend that, you know, he was asked, does this mean there's a rift? would seem that he had a rift with his prior attorney general and he said, no. so, i think he should listen.
bartiromo: so what about france? you know, france is doing business iran
sedition. he incited a violent group of domestic terrorists, and
wallace: and is that a viable option?
don't believe what they are telling you for even a millisecond. the democrats are targeting the 800,000 government workers on furlough. they're targeting them.
senate does. it doesn't look like they're going to stop in terms of trying to come up
joe biden, (d) presidential candidate: anyone who is in a. situation where they are in need of healthcare, regardless of whether they are documented or undocumented, we have an obligation to see that they are cared for.
people that were involved in the fisa abuse scam.
but first, let's bring in mark meredith, reporting from the president's retreat at mar-a-lago with the latest -- mark.
ingraham: so ari, that's his input on the jury selection here of the senate.
bartiromo: so what happens this week? you have got vote on the house
donald trump is a guy who, you understand, he hurts you. even my testosterone sometimes makes me want to feel like punching him.
wallace: how damaging, if you don't show strong support among latinos in nevada, african-americans in south carolina -- because that question of whether or not you can get support from those minorities, of course, is the big knock on your campaign?
ingraham: victor, speaking of former obama folks, your favorite victor, john kerry was on television tonight. don't you know? watch.
folds: as an artist, what i do is i capture the thing that i see, the thing that interests me. my job is putting that idea in a bottle, which i've taken my whole life to do, and to share that with other people.
andrew mccabe, former fbi deputy director: it is an absolute disgrace that they took two years before they finally drew the obvious conclusion.
all, right now, on fox news sunday.
the president and his top health officials had said they would ban flavored e-cigarettes back in september because those fruity flavors appeal to teens and children.
wallace: can you and i talk about michael -- can we talk about michael bloomberg?
coons: i don't expect the president to capitulate. i do expect them to compromise.
congressman swalwell sits on the house intelligence committee and had weekly access to highly-sensitive, classified material as a result.

wallace: chuck, how much trouble is biden in with the performance in those other states? even his one-time overwhelming lead in south carolina is now beginning to slip away.
mnuchin: the europeans are adhering to our primary sanctions. again, as we
do you find any of those arguments persuasive?
ingraham: we've got to go, but the government has no right to determine this, no right to do this. and they are not going to allow people to hold these guns.
and i generally agree that we obviously have to have compassion for people who are living with hiv, but we should not extend that compassion or understanding to criminals to go from a felony to a misdemeanor. and keep this in mind, in washington state, particularly western washington, they don't prosecute misdemeanors.
trump: the southern border is a dangerous, horrible disaster. we've done a great job, but you can't really do the kind of job we have to do unless you have a major powerful barrier.
on january 1st, just two days ago, you know, we signed into law and it's gone into effect where people that burglarize, that rape 3 -- rape third class, and a number of different crimes, violent crimes are now being considered not violent. and people aren't held when they get locked up.
i mean the administration in 2017 and 2018 has said, on the record, no terrorist organization has sent people to the united states through mexico. so hard to declare it a national security emergency.
in other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 american households. and if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. since 1978 ceo salaries in america's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. in 1965, ceos in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. as recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. no wonder people are sending money to bernie sanders. that's what happens when you abuse the system. you discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. in europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. airbus ceo tom enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. that's a lot, but it was half as much as boeing's dennis muilenburg made, and airbus planes didn't even crash. this is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. it's dangerous for our country. why? well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like dennis muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. attitudes are changing fast.
bartiromo: eight democrats opposed this resolution. six are in the swing
pelosi: everything that he has done whether it is in syria vis-a-vis the turks, whether it's been in ukraine in terms of withholding assistance as they try to fight the russians. his denial about their role in our election then and now all roads lead to - and sometimes i wonder about mitch mcconnell to what's he - why is he an accomplice to all of that.
wallace: now the president weighs declaring a national emergency and funding the wall.
what do you get the sense he's going to push first? what do you think he'll
cicilline: look, i think we need to move forward on our agenda. at the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. i'm one of the people who think we have to wait for mr. mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.
president-elect joe biden released a crucial element of his new coronavirus vaccine plan friday, as his office announced he doesn't intend to hold back doses of the authorized vaccines to ensure that people already vaccinated have a waiting dose for a second shot.
some workers are relying on donations, including launching gofundme campaigns. a food pantry has opened up at a coast guard base in boston.
holmes: well, i mean the behavior that you described just now, chris, is
mitt romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream republican view. and he's right about that. for generations, republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. modern democrats generally support those goals enthusiastically.
i will also say this, chris -- i was very concerned by president trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that vladimir putin's russia had interfered in our 2016 election. there's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of president trump to complement president putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for president putin.
let's start in iran, where we did see those protesters this weekend. the
sen. cory booker, d-n.j., former presidential candidate: i will be a president for all people in america.
and that's it for today. have a great week and we'll see you next fox news
friday, because this is the guy who lit the fuse for this impeachment scam
chris wallace, host: i'm chris wallace.
three. you saw the stock market break 29000 for the first time last week.
and we're back now with the panel.

remember is the true mark of donald trump's presidency.

goldberg: no, i think that's right. i think there are two issues here. one, the expletive, which she should have apologized for and just moved on. i don't think president trump has an enormous amount of credibility condemning that kind of language or debasing discourse in any way.
i don't what that means policy wise. i said are we talking executive
wallace: so what to expect? do you -- i mean, going forward you expect the president to stay out of these cases?
wallace: walk us through, when you're sitting at a piano, how you come up with an idea.
but i am stunned at her behavior. number one, any judge who concerns herself with the media or the press needs to get a thick skin or at least wear a few robes to make it look like she has thick skin. all right.
carlson: it just shows you what political leaders can do the damage they can wreak. i mean, all of our attention is on the national stage. but here you have just a mayor, just as mayor of a city, causing remarkable damage to people.
wallace: president trump, not surprisingly, went on a twitter storm about this story yesterday.
that. i think the president needs them, because they need to be -- these fire-
tucker carlson: we don't know where the situation with iran is going but we can be certain that if it breaks into a full-blown war a few things will be true. it will likely cost much more than they tell you, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars. at the end america's likely to be weaker than it was in the beginning and we know this for certain, our biggest rival will be stronger. who's our biggest rival? it's not iran, despite what they tell you in washington. it is needless to say, china. well, we're continuing to squander money and blood in baghdad and many other capitals in that region. china is growing its economy at home even as it expands its reach throughout latin america, the caribbean, africa, even the heartland of the united states. one person who's paying close attention to this, one of the few who cares, is j.d. vance, the author, of course, of hillbilly elegy and we're happy to have him on our show tonight. j.d., thanks so much for coming on. i don't think anybody mourns the death of soleimani in this country anyway, but i wonder what the chinese think as they watch this.
the fed claims quantitative easing is to save the economy…when the real goals are printing enough fake money to pay for $3.7 trillion in government handout bribes to obama's voters…and making billionaire crony capitalists like warren buffett far richer last year, by turning wall street into a fixed craps game that makes bankers and ceo's filthy rich…while our children and unborn grandchildren owe back trillions in debt. by the way obama's buddy warren buffett made $12.7 billion last year. how'd you do?
the best way forward for the trump administration, then, is to do more of what it's been doing. for example, it can engage spain, colombia and panama—havens for the regime's ill-gotten games—and ask them to issue stronger targeted sanctions.
our health care system. you know, joe biden did not campaign on huge,
the african-american community weren't the perpetrators of that financial crisis, many of them were the victims. what is he talking about?
i want him to resign, i want him out. he has caused enough damage, alaska
wallace: another question for the new chair of the senate judiciary committee.
regarding impeachment, i think it depends. i know the democrats are going
deliver those articles to the senate. they were not delivered the next day.

there are now 70% more americans collecting entitlement checks than working in the private sector (148 million takers vs. 86 million makers)… a fact provided by the u.s. census bureau.
and you see why. they were wrong. they are the appeasers. he's the
this billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that michael bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at woodstock when he was a teenager. he said these several years ago, a few short years ago as mayor of new york and it's the way he said it.
and it's time now for our sunday group. former republican congressman jason chaffetz, mo elleithee of georgetown university's institute of politics and public service, marie harf, co-host of benson and harf on fox news radio, and jonah goldberg of the national review.
carolla: what we have to do is all stop apologizing at the same time. i mean, if there's one guy with a gun, we just have pool cues and we all need to charge them at once. if we do it one by one, we'll be taken out one by one.
making sure healthcare is affordable and accessible for every californian, including undocumented community members whom the federal government has unjustly shut out of care, is essential to reaching that vision for our future, the organization said. today's announcement is an historic step on the road toward health justice for all.
green: so far every action he's taken has been spectacular, from cutting taxes that created massive growth at least in our state in tennessee, to one of the biggest pay raises for our veterans -- our soldiers in -- in ten plus years. you know, i -- i think the actions that he's taken are spectacular and i can't see an area where i would disagree with him at this point.
and you know, tucker when state and local officials can't solve existential problems, they blame other reasons and when they can't deal with homelessness and then you banned plastic bottles at san francisco airport.
andrew johnson did so to general ulysses grant in 1869 -- chris.
cuccinelli: we have some lines of folks who've come in internationally. this is all international here. customs and border protection, they are looking at your travel history. they're asking you different questions than maybe they did a month or two ago.
wallace: but barr said the tweets are making it impossible to do his job.
bartiromo: well, so you want him to delay the state of the union.
is it true the chinese recently adopted malicious cybersecurity rules that
wallace: congressman, do you think that there was a race component to the
you know, it's one thing to have this so-called top law enforcement policy of stop and frisk. it was ruled unconstitutional. and it has taken him years to say i'm sorry about that. he has the -- he has the resources, but i'm -- i am very uncomfortable with -- with his record. very comfortable.
strategist, host of the war room podcast.
trump: congress should do this. if they can't do it, i will declare a national emergency.
0.6 percent of misdemeanor arrests, these are actually in jail.
obviously, the vaccination program isn't really legislative. i think
place where they have been challenged, not only economically, but
though america didn't cause venezuela's problems, the trump administration is trying to be part of the solution. its primary motive: to ease the intolerable suffering caused by the socialist regime and its destabilizing effects on the entire region.
carlson: so do you think he is capable -- but sincerely, do you think he is capable of governing the country, an honest question right now, joe biden.
what does the president think is his legal authority to intervene in criminal cases and to order who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted?
president wants witnesses or doesn't want witnesses. what is this going to
whitaker: the clinton impeachment precedent is probably what we should follow because it was during the saner time where actually the senate didn't have these partisan inflammations like we have currently in our country.
wallace: but he wants the wall to do that.
so far 11 people have died in italy and parts of the country are shutting down.
and now you're seeing it. you're seeing the people, whether it's at the
do you know where those 4,000 people come -- where they're captured? airports.
wallace: let me ask you about some other things. you were a top member of
but it says something that the fbi would react to the firing of comey this way and that somebody -- somebody who was then near the top of the fbi, leaked this to the new york times. shame on them.
then, there are two new front runners in the democratic race.
perino: so you're saying i think you're talking about the hillary clinton comment in the 2016 campaign.
jason rantz, radio show host: it will be when this bill passes and this bill is going to pass. all of the democrats in the house said yes.
public why she had to move so urgently.
but people like myself who were sounding the alarm bells to have a marxist -- this guy was the number three official in a marxist regime of ethiopia.
perino: in which basically she was like celebrating the fact that they were going to try to put coal out of business, and then she had the deplorables line and she never really came back from that.
mnuchin: well, maria, i wouldn't focus on any one week. we have created
all, right now, on fox news sunday.
sen. chuck schumer (d-ny): for the first time in six years, democrats will
chaffetz: protecting our borders is the right side of the argument.
last four years, why was this week the final straw? why now, say, that you
bernie, for all his craziness, is nevertheless authentic. in fact, this is one characteristic he shares with trump. people who meet trump, people who encounter trump, say this guy is real, he's the real deal. he is what he is. bernie is what he is. now, i don't like what he is. i just read an article about how bernie was thrown out of a commune because he didn't want to do any work. he wanted to talk about politics all day. the commune was all about self-sufficiency, growing your own food. so bernie is making the case for being a bum, and there's a little bit of us that wants to do that. we don't want to get off the couch, we don't want to go to work. so there is a little bit of us that is bernie, and i think that's the secret of bernie's appeal.
and so, what we are saying to the president is open up the government. these other departments have nothing to do with this. do not punish the american people by shutting down government if you don't get your way.
gaetz: yes, boy. he's covering stuff up faster than a cat in a litter box. i mean when you look at the biden behavior, it is exculpatory for the president. think about it. if the biden's are truly corrupt, it could never be an impeachable offense to investigate corruption or to ask our friends to investigate corruption pursuant to our treaties and so, we will put that evidence on if witnesses are allowed in this trial and we will i think be able to prove dispositively that this president as he has always done was putting the interests of the american people and the american taxpayer first. these were legitimate questions.
speaker pelosi is not stopping there. a third provision in the rules package codifies censorship over members of the house, subjecting them to disciplinary action if they post or share information deemed to be distorted or manipulated.
there were little pictures of all the things cuomo loved about himself. his sports car, his dog, his staff members, the boyfriend of one of his daughter's depicted hanging off a cliff and a giant nose with a cotton swab inside of it. the giant nose image was perhaps a reference to a giggly interview with his news anchor brother chris on cnn about getting a covid test while body bags were piling up in storage trucks outside of funeral homes in the state.
boeing is one of the largest exporters.
he's a witness and they should also consider doing preliminary hearings outside of a full senate trial to kind of litigate these issues, about prosecutorial misconduct, about what schiff did.
ingraham: trump calls him mini-michael bloomberg. i think major, though, is more appropriate, as in major waste of money. so what now, though? i guess a lot of fretting and awkward admissions, that's what.
and we have a trial, and after i'm acquitted, i'm going to come and have
tucker carlson: johnny joey jones is a veteran of the war in iraq, he lost his legs to an ied there. soleimani is believed to have masterminded hundreds of ied attacks during the u.s. occupation of this country, so we thought it'd be interesting to speak to jones. he joins us tonight. johnny, thanks so much for coming on. you have a very personal connection to this story of course. we just explained it. so, i'm interested in your reaction to what happened yesterday.
that's been transparent here is donald trump.
ned ryun: to actually fund this. but the amazing part to me is the immoral behavior of these governors. they have one moral imperative. their moral imperative is to advance the interest of the citizens of their state to do otherwise is to be immoral.
and we're back now with the panel.
wallace (on camera): if you can do all of this in your first 15 years on
republicans say this could actually weaken america's position in the middle
but he does it because the base loves it. i'm not even sure he really wants these threats and orders carried out, but the base loves it and that is why he will keep doing it.
wallace: let's go back to the events of wednesday afternoon, as a veteran
matt whitaker, former acting attorney general: that's exactly what mitch mcconnell's trying to avoid but as you mentioned, it takes 51 votes to do about anything. we know the outcome of the trial. we just don't know how we're going to get there right now. so as i look at what the senate is trying to accomplish, it is trying to keep a solid group of republican senators together that keeps its train on the tracks. if they can't, then we could have hunter biden, we could have a whole host of folks be witnesses and that's when, i think the credibility of the senate is really - could take a serious hit.
let's take the shutdown. the wall that the president says has to be a wall or, you know, some version of a wall. you hear nancy pelosi say a wall is immoral. how do you compromise from that kind of rhetoric?
cuccinelli: really what we're trying to do is slow down the virus getting here and reduce the impact when it does get here.
founding partner, cavalry: well, they certainly have the ability as a
hunter? i'd love to have the whistle-blower who wrote a fake report.
nancy pelosi says, even if you open up the government, i wouldn't fund a wall. so, that's why i'm depressed. you know, there's not much talk about what she said. she's telling the president, even if you open up the government, i'm not going to do a deal on the wall. and that's a nonstarter for the president.
bartiromo: well, the whistle-blower apparently also worked for john
sanders: the president wants to do this all at once. he knows it's better if they can focus on getting all of these packages done at one time.
the articles now, slow-walking, really, slow-walking the impeachment trial,

not only has cuomo and his administration failed to provide any information to the justice department, lawmakers, hammond, or countless reporters and grieving families who have asked they be disclosed, he also prefers to blame others for his disastrous mandate and instead says all of it is politically motivated.
julian castro, d-former presidential candidate: keep reaching for your dream, and keep fighting for what you believe in. ganaremos un dia.

it's nearly impossible to overdose on pot. but banning marijuana drives sales into the black market, where criminals do the selling. and criminals are more likely to settle their disagreements with guns.
brandon judd, national border patrol council president: anywhere that you look where we have built walls, they have worked. they have been an absolute necessity for border patrol agents in securing the border.
sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., presidential candidate: i was disappointed to hear that bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me. he knows who i am, where i come from. we all saw the impact of the factionalism in 2016, and we can't have a repeat of that.
sen. chris coons (d), delaware: thanks, chris. good morning.

tucker carlson: and that's tells you a lot. jim antle, great to see tonight. thank you for that.
rep. matt gaetz, r-fla.: this is a failed strategy and it's not that all roads lead back to putin for president trump. it's that all roads lead back to russia for the democrats in the absence of an agenda that actually works for the american people.
fox & friends, 6 a.m. et: special guests include: paul blair, director of strategic initiatives at americans for tax reform, talks about tax hikes to expect from dems; tomi lahren, fox nation host, talks border wall; christian whiton, former state department adviser, talks about secretary of state mike pompeo's policy speech in cairo; diamond & silk, fox nation hosts; dan henniger, deputy editor at the wall street journal, on trump's chances in 2020.
ingraham: were you surprised that pelosi started saying things like you're impeached forever. this is like mean girls. like you're impeached forever like you're charged for it but if you were ultimately acquitted. it doesn't even matter if you're charged.
the union. he was talking about giving a rally. i mean, this is deja vu all
buttigieg: well, i'll leave it to pundits due to the political analysis.
so the next time democrats start talking about science, tell them that strong and reliable science and research don't just matter when they fit the democratic agenda. ask them to refute decades of medical research that demonstrate the real harm caused by marijuana.
perino: but people thought that he meant it when he said that. joe biden has the capability to be that kind of guy as well. but what he said the other night was much more in line with sort of the fundraising circuit for democrats, not the people circuit.
wallace: ok, we got a minute left in this segment and i want to ping-pong back and forth and get your predictions.

tammy bruce, fox nation host: yes, it's a little insulting, isn't it? but more insulting might be when he changes -- the only unique thing about pete at this point is his last name. but if he changes that to obama, then he will have everything wrapped up perfectly.
carlson: so i don't think there is any topic on which there is a greater divide between what the majority of citizens of all parties, all colors say they want and what they get from the people in charge. why is this complicated for our leaders?
this one is another example that i've never talked about publicly, which is
and by the way, is there anyone who thinks that the biden's just stopped at the ukraine. they were running the same gambit in china and elsewhere because this is how corruption works. it's pervasive with these elements of permanent washington.

tucker carlson: yes. i really wish we had run their names on the screen. i'm sorry we didn't. i hope you come back. i think we should keep hitting this topic.
rove: yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of comey. this was leaked to the new york times, which says something about the culture inside the fbi. the only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, mueller is appointed. this was probably immediately subsumed by mueller -- the mueller investigation and has been, i suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.

the larger point here, chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. far from it. all of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. and the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.

regrettably, asking a lifelong politician and the leader of nys for an apology was met with deflection, blame and deafening silence! we are asked often if cuomo ever apologized (would we accept) and our, response is the 'self-appointed pandemic god' does not make mistakes, so why would he ever apologize?

dinesh d'souza, conservative filmmaker: i think you are quite right that they began with a diversity parade. you have two groups of people, the ones claiming to be diverse, buttigieg, i'm gay, cory booker, i'm black, kamala harris, i'm black and a woman, so i'm a twofer. and then the other candidates like elizabeth warren and others, beto, aspiring to be diverse, and pretending to be diverse in ways that they were not. so it was a diversity parade and a diversity charade.
mccabe: we are seeing things happen every day in this country that many of us never, ever thought we'd see here -- the pursuit of political enemies and the use of the criminal justice system.
he didn't say what those measures would be. but while some people are suggesting they might ask u.s. troops to leave the country, the u.s. is, in fact, sending more troops over. 4,000 to come into the region. they're coming from the eighty second airborne. they're heading to kuwait. 750 have already come into baghdad to protect the embassy there. so, somewhat conflicting ideas at the moment. president trump saying that he does not want war, that they killed qasem soleimani to avoid bloodshed because he was planning more attacks on americans. but at the moment, suddenly heightened, heightened tensions here. tucker?
newly-elected utah senator mitt romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the washington post that savaged donald trump's character and leadership. romney's attack and trump's response wednesday morning on twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. it's even possible that romney is planning to challenge trump for the republican nomination in 2020. we'll see.
and so get -- staying quiet about impeachment is totally in nancy pelosi's and the democrat's long-term interest until there's a reason to actually talk about impeachment.
ingraham: mark, is it true that these guns, however you want to define this assault style, and as a lawyer, the language, you could drive a truck through it, and they did it on purpose. but if this thing gets passed, there's no grandfather provision in the provision that most want, not grandfather provision, meaning you become a felon in the commonwealth of virginia if you have one of these weapons as a law-abiding citizen, yes or no?
the hillary clintons, the foreign policy establishment, the neville chamberlains. they were the appeasers. he stopped the appeasement. he went to economic
they did a concurrent resolution. and you have to understand this, maria,
tucker carlson: my sense, my strong sense is that the president's preference is to leave, that it's always been that he's sincere when he says he doesn't want regime change and he's not trying to start any wars. he understands that those are not in america's interest and they're not in his interest either politically. i'm wondering, though, if the people around him understand that.

dershowitz: alexander hamilton in federalist 65 said the greatest danger is for impeachment to turn on how many votes one party can have against the other party. and that's exactly what happened. look, it would be ideal if we had impeachments that were neutral, objective, bipartisan. that's what the framers had in mind. but this case doesn't rise to that level in any sense.
carlson: well, according to multiple sources ghislaine maxwell was jeffrey epstein's fixer, the person who facilitated his abuse of teenage girls.
chaffetz: well, this is not the -- candidate romney didn't -- didn't talk like this. that's not who he was. he accepted his endorsement in october. in a debate he was asked a question and he said he's putting the past behind him. he looks to working forward.

elleithee: so, on the comment, i'd -- i'd -- i'd be hard-pressed to disagree with anything jonah said. the -- i spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and i think that is wrong and i don't think democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize democrats for acting like him. so i wish he wouldn't have used that language.
ingraham: that is just a joke, but it was kind of like with bill clinton at the ron brown funeral. i'm really going back in time.
nancy pelosi slow-walked this. one was to find more evidence, ok, because
wallace: i'll let you answer about the fencing answer. but -- but, i mean, here's the problem it seems to me. if the -- if nancy pelosi were to say tomorrow, all right, we're going to give you the money for the wall, she'd be thrown out as speaker. her -- her house democratic caucus would not stand for that. if the president were to say, you know what, i give up on the wall, his political base, that 39, 40 percent would turn on him.
but i think, you know, if we've seen anything from nancy pelosi in the few months since democrats retook the house, it's that she can bring those members together. and as long as donald trump's in the white house, i think she's going to be pretty effective. and she's shown that this week in holding the line.
but i do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment.
harf: well, in response to the first question, i think that's actually a problem the republican party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, president trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for republicans to criticize president trump. and if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent donald trump base. so i think what will be interesting is what this senate does as we get the mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.
we have to stop kicking the can down the road and just continuing to say, let's do it again in 30 days. let's do it in 45 days.

he didn't have a conversation with bill barr about the roger stone case. he had a conversation with the whole world. he put it, as he is want to do, on his twitter feed, on social media. and he expresses himself, cuts at the middlemen -- i know the middlemen don't like that -- in the democratization of information where he tells everybody what he thinks it and a number of issues, including the stone case.
tucker carlson: yeah, that's not true, actually. and we were reminded of that just last week. an armed civilian halted what could have been a massacre in texas in a church, likely saving many lives. but over at usa today on the op-ed page, they were distressed. the op-ed said we should be, and we're quoting now, horrified that so many civilians in that church were carrying guns. dana loesch, host of the dana show. she joins us tonight to assess this. so, dana, we should be horrified about a scenario that worked as well as it possibly could. an armed civilian stopped a massacre. what's horrifying about that? what's terrifying about that?
and they're going to be put on trial, because they don't have a case.
chris wallace, fox news anchor: i'm chris wallace.
eric trump, exec vice pres, trump org: yes, by the way, it's tough to watch, laura. i mean, it's really, really tough. you have to - you get paid to watch it because of who i am. it is tough to get through it. i mean, here you have a group that's saying we want to take 160 million people off their private health care plans. it's nuts, right? i mean, you saw - you saw what buttigieg said about decriminalizing border crossing. so let's just let everybody come. let's pay for everybody's health insurances. let's pay for all the problems of the rest of the world. it's crazy. you have biden who is their front runner, who literally can't get through a sentence without stumbling. the rest of them are totally insane. i mean this is not jfk's democratic party. this is a totally radical democratic party and quite frankly, i think they're handing my father the win.
rep. rashida tlaib, d-mich.: we're going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother (expletive deleted).
gregg jarrett, fox news legal analyst: well, i agree with you. it lends legitimacy to illegitimate articles of impeachment. the second one is an utter joke. obstruction of congress for asserting a legal right to resist a subpoena. if congress disagreed, their remedy is to go to federal court, it's always been that way. so that one should immediately be dismissed.

ingraham: well, apparently mitt romney doesn't think so and i don't know about susan collins and lisa murkowski, but if they could put aside their dislike for some of what the president says or does for the constitution and what's good for the country, they'd get thumbs up from me and a lot of other people. so, gentlemen, thanks so much.
the san francisco chronicle reported tuesday that the district attorney's office, under boudin's leadership, dismissed previous criminal strikes against mcalister and agreed to the five years he had already served for a 2015 robbery. marshall said the district attorney's office reviewed the case carefully, including substantial mitigation presented.

brennan, worked with john brennan for a time.
yet, the pathologies of modern rural america are familiar to anyone who visited downtown baltimore in the 1980s: stunning out of wedlock birthrates. high male unemployment. a terrifying drug epidemic. two different worlds. similar outcomes. how did this happen? you'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. but mostly they're not. they don't have to be interested. it's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born americans who are slipping behind.
carlson: no, that's -- i mean, i think that's there's not any room for improvement there at all. but the question of speech, do you think the country has become freer or less free in the last year?
sanders: it's not just -- it's not that. but you also have to look at the six bills. those aren't the budget that we submitted, either. there are a lot of discrepancies between what we --
lies and fraud are at the center of this murder of the middle class. president obama and various big government politicians need to distract the middle class from their real agenda. lies are their wmd- weapon of mass distraction.

this is not necessarily the same thing as saying the second vaccine doses should remain in federal deep freeze. in fact, i have no problem whatsoever with the biden plan providing that the recipients adhere to the terms of the fda's conditional approval. in other words, increase the vaccine supply, but ensure proper administration based on current science and federal law.

carlson: richard goodstein. good luck. well, comrade sanders and old man joe were not the only democrats running for president and not the only ones embarrassing themselves.

but mexico and china are also linked to the deaths of americans. each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. so, does that mean we get to bomb oaxaca? can we start assassinating generals in the people's liberation army? maybe. maybe ben sasse will call for that, too. he's a former consultant and a very tough character. but before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the united states richer and more secure. there are an awful lot of bad people in this world. we can't kill them all. it's not our job. instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of american citizens. period. that's why we have a government. so, has the killing of soleimani done that? maybe. no one in washington has explained how. instead, like ben sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. he clearly was. so? that's irrelevant. meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. we're praying they don't, but they could. how do we know that? because we've seen it before. we fought quite a number of wars around the middle east in recent decades. we attacked saddam hussein twice, as you know. in the end we killed him. we invaded an occupied afghanistan. we toppled moammar gaddafi in libya.
i will re-ask that question this coming week. i have some other concerns about his views on criminal justice and civil rights. but the mueller investigation, the rule of law, his willingness to defend the appropriate independence of the department of justice will be critical to my vote.
that didn't happen on wednesday. it hasn't much since the election, and

president trump's lawyers could make a motion to dismiss or one of the senators could make a motion to dismiss and take a vote right away. whether they decide to do that or not will be up obviously to the members of the senate, maybe to the chief justice initially. but i have absolutely no doubt that the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power which every president since adams has been accused of, by their political opponents and obstruction of congress, which is another way of saying, the president exercised separation of powers and checks and balances in an entirely proper way should never come to actual trial.

many democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. it is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.
now, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.

can they nominate -- will they perhaps nominate someone who's got bloomberg's record? and we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in new york, crime did go down. he's given tremendous amounts of money on a lot of issues that democrats like, climate change, a lot of women's groups. can, in the me too era, the democratic party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?
carlson: begging -- and if you're not, you're not grateful. you're a bad person.

trump: it's kind of interesting how that works, they all get into - they all get into business when their father becomes vice president or their brother becomes vice president. we get out of business when our father becomes president, it's kind of interesting. but for the bidens, this is a business. i mean there's no question they became a business. you see his brother doing it and by the way, if you actually tracked down the schools, laura, they ended up all failing, right? i mean it was - it was another it was another democratic policy that ended up going into total ruins because all the schools ended up failing. so not only did he profit off of it but the system didn't ultimately work. they didn't get the end results which reminds me of most of joe biden's policy.

douglas macgregor: well, i'm told that tomorrow the iraqi parliament is going to vote overwhelmingly to demand the removal of our forces from iraq. if that's the case i sincerely hope that president trump will take advantage of it and get us out. we should've been out of iraq and syria a long time ago as the president pointed out, as you have reiterated. we gain nothing by staying in the country whatsoever. if these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. but if we are going to fight the iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. as for the active killing soleimani, i think we can say with some certainty that iran will respond. probably not in the way that we would. the iranians are not like us. they do not emote. you've been listening to people emote about how much they hate soleimani and blame the failure in iraq on soleimani. that's nonsense. we failed in iraq. the generals and the politicians are responsible for the loss of american life and the squandering of our opportunities in iraq. soleimani simply took advantage of it and iran now controls iraq.
carlson: trace gallagher. amazing story. we will get more on the coronavirus later this hour and how the trump administration is planning to respond.

the other thing is, i don't understand how the democratic party is going to sit back and take it. is it really worth it to this democratic party in the age of the #metoo movement, black lives matter, you had the first african- american president, you have completely squeezed out and spat out the candidates of color this time, cory booker. julian castro, kamala harris, they are out of the race. you're left -- you're left with a bunch of white people, old white people at that with the exception of your next guest, mayor buttigieg, and you're going to go backwards because michael bloomberg will spend money and will take and will consult donald trump?

there have been many calls for an independent, bipartisan investigation into the nursing home tragedy, especially after an internal nys health department study (conducted by cuomo's own administration) dismissed the covid-19 recovering patients as the reason for the thousands of deaths, and instead blamed staff members and visitors. the governor's investigation of himself was panned for its complete whitewash of his failed response.

tucker carlson: and quickly and finally, do you think it's likely if the iraqi parliament issues a demand that americans leave iraq tomorrow, that we will?

you know, the senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. it is up to us in 2020. it is our only shot. and as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. we dare not get this wrong. and that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the senate.

wallace: and how big an issue do you think this would be in a general election? clearly they think it would be an issue. the idea that -- that you would need -- and you have reached out to social conservatives, many of whose votes you'd need -- but who might have concerns about your sexual orientation?

brazile: i should be a mess right now.
so, sometimes, we will vote after their caucus, would be wednesday or
joining me now are two gop congressman lee zeldin, house foreign affairs committee member and matt gaetz, house judiciary committee member. congressman zeldin, let's start with you. why do you think the democrats especially the speaker, she's usually smarter than that? i mean i don't agree with her on a lot, but she's usually smarter than that. that was actually surprising even to me and i've been in this town longer than both of you probably combined, which is scary. but what do you think?
ingraham: the field of shattered dreams, that's the focus of tonight's angle.
so, it's not -- it's disingenuous to say that people -- presidents don't comment on criminal matters.
the government shutdown is now in week four, the longest in u.s. history, a record no one here in washington can be proud of. hundreds of thousands of federal workers face their first payday friday without getting paid. talks to reopen nine federal departments have broken down and lawmakers are out of town until tomorrow afternoon.
wallace: mike bloomberg reacting to president trump's barrage of attacks this week, but the former new york city mayor also facing incoming about his long record in public life.
coons: democrats will invest in border security. i'm not going to sit here on your show and negotiate on behalf of speaker pelosi, but i'll tell you that what lindsey graham himself just told the president is a great place to start here.
cicilline: well, that's a question the speaker will have to answer, but i think what she means by that is it doesn't reflect our values as a country, that america has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants, people who are fleeing violence and war.
about this with secretary pompeo on friday.
we sent a team of producers to san francisco for an in-depth exclusive investigation into what is happening there. and the effect it is having on the dwindling pool of middle class residents.
today, had absolutely nothing to do with anything that was actually wrong.
dana loesch: good to see you, tucker. thank you.
jarrett: and he has every right to invoke it.
ingraham: yes, something for that. all right, new york times' michael shear had this to say about the president's defense thus far.
boudin, meanwhile, has blamed the san francisco police union, its president, and individual officers for spreading what he called lies and misinformation. his office has received the same number of burglary cases from police for possible prosecution, despite burglaries increasing nearly 50% between 2019 and 2020, he said.
new judge who has been put in place, and he picks one of the guys that was
the point is across the country, in city after city, murder rates have surged dramatically compared with just five years ago. this is happening.
ingraham: gregg, here's what romney said, senator romney from utah said about having more witnesses testify.
so, what you're going to have is harry reid and chuck schumer's desire to stack the court on their democratic watch has come back to haunt them.
wallace: yes, let me just really quickly explained that when the democrats with the majority, majority leader harry reid changed it for judicial nominees short of the supreme court and for cabinet appointees.
rep. rashida tlaib, d-mich.: when your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won. bullies don't win. and i said, baby, they don't, because we're going to go in there and we're going to the mother (expletive deleted).
explained, justified cutting off the president. i want to put up a couple
bartiromo: the economy there has already weakened quite a bit. you talked
the obama administration largely watched from the sidelines as the venezuelan regime ran the country into the ground. it stood silent as then-vice president tareck zaidan el aissami, an alleged drug-trafficking kingpin, worked hand in glove with los zetas and other regional drug cartels. it was not until trump came into office that the treasury department imposed sanctions on el aissami.
mac donald: well, the activists are for it, the academia is for it. again, the universities are the source of this narrative that says that everything about america today is defined and created by racism. and i guess, the public does not have a voice.
however, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds.
twitter and what about the decision of amazon and other big tech companies
we never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, pg&e which was at one time as you remember as a californian, the best utility in the united states. it's ossified. it's calcified. it's over regulated. it's got all these green mandates. it's got to use expensive energy production.
wallace: let me just interrupt for a second, because speaker pelosi and democratic senate leader schumer have been hinting at this on friday after the meeting, is that the democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government?
alisyn camerota, cnn anchor: the feeling from this administration is that we are in a full-blown crisis and that they are overwhelmed by it. how do you think?
february 3. bernie sanders is in first place. and what this does is, this
mulvaney: yes, (inaudible) sort of sit here and say yes or no, but i would
katrina foley, costa mesa mayor: i can't think of one situation that would lead us to believe that this is an appropriate location. why? why costa mesa? why now?
tucker carlson: sounds that way. benjamin hall. we're out of time tonight. we'll be back monday. have the best weekend.
rep. nancy pelosi (d-ca), speaker of the house: if the vice president and
graham: less damage than if we don't fix a broken immigration system. you've got to bad choices here. continue to stalemate and see parts of the government shutdown, it will be inconvenient and it can create problems. into the federal workforce, i'm sorry you caught up in this mess. but the real damage is people coming across the border, selling drugs, killing americans, that needs to come to an end. so, the real damage is a broken border compared to a partial shutdown.
this is a reversal of what the trump administration has been doing.
cuomo is certainly good at giving out advice but fails miserably when it comes to following it.
by the i.g. report. this is the crime of the century. this was an attempted coup on a sitting
a california department of corrections and rehabilitation spokeswoman told the associated press that mcalister has been incarcerated in state prisons numerous times. in april 2020, he was sentenced in san francisco county to five years for second-degree robbery and was released on parole for time served.

boudin, 40, was elected to the district attorney's office in 2019 having never prosecuted a case and never run for elected office.
williams: no, that was fencing. it was fencing and barriers, not wall.
police response on wednesday as compared to some demonstrations -- well,
nearly three-quarters of a century ago, winston churchill described socialism as the equal sharing of misery. venezuela under maduro shows that description holds true today.

republicans and conservatives that there's really something wrong with the
wallace: with nancy pelosi back as speaker, we'll discuss the new challenges facing the president in this era of divided government with white house press secretary sarah sanders.
wallace: donna, haven't democrats learned their lesson? move on from impeachment and investigations?
ben folds, musician and author: because there seems to be a hierarchy, which you would think exists where the symphony is the great thing and the -- the -- the rockers of the dumb ones. but it's not that simple and each have something to offer the other.

colorado's crime rate did rise a bit. but many things influence crime rates. washington state's violent crime rate rose a little but slightly less than the national average.
mills: right. so i think the president of the united states' convictions on this matter are sincere, but i think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with.
make this announcement tomorrow morning. let's take a short break. we have got a lot more with steve bannon when we come right back. stay with us.
it doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when i was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now.
carlson: last week on the show, we covered the sentencing of roger stone who is perhaps the most undeserving of all the casualties of the russia collusion hysteria.
think this trial, he ought to go big. he ought to demand witnesses. i think
but it's my suspicion that that will ultimately lead to the least suspenseful trial in all of trials because we all know that the result will be the president being exonerated because he did nothing wrong in his call with president zelensky.
i've asked him those questions, and i'm very comfortable with those answers. so, i think you'd be a great attorney general, great job by the president to pick mr. barr. i see no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and the russians, but that would be up to mr. mueller to make his report to attorney general and he soon will i hope.
wallace: how serious is he about that? has the white house drafted an emergency order? a resolution that he could, that he could -- that he could announce tomorrow -- we're going to declare a national emergency; we're going to build the wall. has he set a deadline for when he's going to end talks and simply say, i'm going to go off on my own and do it? and is he really prepared --
record numbers of americans are not in the workforce (over 92 million).
unidentified male: on the iran front, could he bumble himself into war?
ingraham: california, we have to walk across the hypodermic needles and the homeless crisis to actually find people to interview, leo, and you know that is the case. all right, so i wouldn't hold out california as a shining beacon of what is sane these days. i love california, it is a beautiful state, but they are ruining --
bannon: the people that want freedom and democracy against these dictators
wallace: there are a lot of very well-intentioned people in that building behind me and somehow it doesn't get done.
trump: i can reveal that i believe it would have been four embassies.
tucker carlson: yeah, i think that's right, and thanks for reminding us of that. johnny thanks for coming on tonight.

spunt: house speaker nancy pelosi says she will move forward with
cain: allow me to answer the question, leo, without you interrupting me.
coons: i have talked with republican colleagues about finding a way that we have a clearer process for welcoming and vetting and making part of the confirmation process any such allegations so they don't arise at the last moment. i think there was a great deal of consternation over the timing of those allegations and then how seriously they were taken and investigated - - or not.
congressman chaffetz, you were -- are a former congressman from utah. what do you make of -- of mitt romney, before he is even sworn in, having an op- ed in the washington post that -- that basically says this president is living -- not living up to his responsibilities as president, certainly in the image department, and what's the reaction been back home?
nancy messonnier, director, national center for immunization and respiratory diseases, c.d.c.: ... include dividing students into smaller groups or in a severe pandemic, closing schools and using internet based tele-schooling to continue education.
carlson: a major coronavirus outbreak in this country is now inevitable. that's the finding of the c.d.c. today. so how do we respond? how is the trump administration working to fight this? a member -- a key member of administration joins us to answer that question after the break.
ingraham: i'm great. isn't the economy good enough across all demographics considerations to swing black voters, at least some to president trump?
having said all that, i'm going to ask the fbi director, was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the russians? i find it astonishing and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the fbi, mccabe and that crowd. i don't trust them as far as i throw them.
when i look back on our own family experience it comes down to this: the dangerous people (those who were recovering from covid-19) were forced into nursing homes, putting others in extreme danger. and people that could make a difference in the residents' physical and emotional well-being (the family members) still, as of this date, are not being allowed into those facilities.
that's why i said, and i'll say it again, that it's a shame that the hard
scott: yes, let's get to the bottom of it. but, look, the bottom line is, we're going to do this.

unidentified male: they nominees are so white this year's oscars are being held at pottery barn.
mnuchin: it is. and let me just say, ambassador lighthizer has led a very, very large team
sanders: we have to look at it across the board.
wallace: thanks for coming in today. always good to talk to you.
it's so humiliating that i personally couldn't do it.
what's remarkable is how the rest of us responded to it. we didn't question why sandberg was saying this. we didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. our corporate media celebrated sandberg as the leader of a liberation movement. her book became a bestseller: lean in. as if putting a corporation first is empowerment. it is not. it is bondage. republicans should say so.
tedros delivered a speech praising zimbabwe as, a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide healthcare to all. now, that's lunatic. but bad politics aside, tedros has endangered human lives, which is a weird resume point for a man running a world health organization.

siegel (on camera): we still have very few coronavirus test kits around. so we don't know how much of the virus there is. we also still don't know exactly how contagious it is. and we don't know how deadly it is.
insurrectionists, to go to the capitol.
swan: well, he does have a base that will follow and support him. it will
set that deadly assault on the capitol in motion.
carlson: so months after jeffrey epstein's death, however, that occurred, his alleged fixer is still free. where is she? new reports tonight about where and who is protecting her? remarkable story. trace gallagher fills us in after the break.
we were all confused. and scared. but none of us knew the tragedy was yet to unfold.
she is a judge who should be outraged that a foreperson on a jury that convicted a man on seven counts may have lied to her, may have exhibited such jury bias that it would demand a new trial. but no, she is mad at you. she is mad at the president. she wants to have a hearing on whether or not there was jury bias in private because she doesn't want anyone intimidating the jury.
wallace: but is it fair game for president trump when he's made sexist comments too?
so, this was the beginning of a conversation that still has i think a lot left to be worked out. they're going to meet again later this afternoon, and hopefully, they'll continue to make progress and continue to move the ball down the field.
ingraham: i like that phrase, partisan inflammations, it sounds like you need a really strong--
prager: your cat liked it. i asked you specifically how it went over in the corolla home. you said the cat loved it.

and if cuomo had admitted early on that he was caught by surprise by a once in a lifetime pandemic, we would have understood.
but we had those successes and we were very proud of the work that we were

just after 3 p.m., as the victims were still telling their stories, cnn anchor brooke baldwin interrupted the coverage, the washington examiner reported at the time. at almost the same time on msnbc, anchor chris jansing broke into the live coverage. 'of course their stories are indeed tragic,' she said, before moving on to a segment that disputed trump's assertion that there is widespread crime committed by illegal immigrants.
wallace: let me ask about women, because there's a long story in the washington post today.
carlson: i can't resist pointing out that at the very moment when we're literally letting arsonists go free, roger stone is facing life in prison for what? it's not even clear.
former presidential favorite joe biden still hasn't won anything in the race so far, but he is counting on south carolina to be his firewall.
wallace: all right. let's talk about the merits of a border wall. here's what new speaker nancy pelosi says.
graham: the plan is to do a deal. he is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. see if we can do a deal around the tps recipients who are going to lose their legal status.
you are dipping into the kool-aid and you don't even know the flavor.
conway: he is small potatoes. he will always be seen as a serial liar and a leaker, as will those who covered for him.
if you think of someone like elizabeth warren and medicare-for-all, that got the full treatment, but julian castro, ever since 2012 thought that he was going to be on that stage, maybe the nominee? i think that he will, though, be on the vp shortlist, even if he really doesn't deserve to be, but his name will be on the list.
supporters of america's long war on drugs said legalization would create disaster. has it? no.
and the american people, now we're seeing the golden age. freeman the other
what do you know about her background? did she want to get on that jury? and everything in my gut tells me she wanted to get on that jury and denied doing anything that was partisan. shame on the judge.
williams: he said mexico will pay for this this.
terrell: laura, can i just make one point?
arroyo: the bias in hollywood is not this. the bias in hollywood is ideological, and it's why passion of the christ and eddie murphy were not nominated and probably won't be, too politically incorrect. and if you had to nominate someone for an oscar, laura, i would choose prince harry. over the last few weeks and that bombshell announcement that harry and meghan markle were planning to withdraw from their royal duties, now video has emerged from july at a movie premiere, where harry is seen pitching his wife to disney ceo bob iger for best support performance supporting your wife so she can support you. here is prince harry.
walked this, because she wants in the middle of the trial -- and i can see
wednesday. but there was a fatigue everything post-election of the
cain: here is leo's problem. california, new york city, and parts of new jersey, washington, d.c., do not represent the rest of america. those are the people that i talk to every day. and those of the people i'm listening to.
obama: and if we can change the city, it can change the state.
upon how they set it up, they would most likely be subject to secondary

we have the numbers. here's what they are. in philadelphia, a city we've taken a close look at in the show under the direction of soros funded da, larry krasner, the city recorded 359 murders for the year. that's the most in more than a decade.
mnuchin: maria, let me first say it wasn't changed in translation. i don't
blower complaint that started the inquiry in the first place.
coons: -- should deliver a report publicly, and that will be the topic of the barr nomination hearings this coming tuesday.
wallace: simple question. does the president think the mccabe case should be reopened?
we will make mistakes in life. we try not to, but we do. the key is to be strong and secure enough to admit your mistakes and admit your shortcomings. – new york gov. andrew cuomo in november 2020 speaking at riverside church in manhattan after releasing his book about leadership in the middle of a pandemic.
this icig actually has connections, was a lawyer for some of the very
what did he lie about? well, on about october -- at the end of october, 2016, he authorized a leak to devin bartlett, then a reporter at the wall street journal. and the leak was about the ongoing investigation into hillary clinton's emails.
victor davis hanson is a lifelong californian. he is a fellow at the hoover institution and we're happy to have him tonight. professor, thanks a lot for coming on. do you think that wildfires besetting your state mean that people should not be allowed to own their own homes?
rove: take a look -- let me finish. let me finish. let me finish. let me finish.
ingraham: president has an obligation to safeguard the american people's money. and he was doing it in ukraine. and that's one of the reasons why he was elected. it is great to see you both tonight. thanks for both coming on.
slotkin: you know, i'm going to suggest michigan beer. you might want to try it. but --
wallace: ok, i want to move on just because i've got so many other questions to ask you.
joining us now, house majority whip jim clyburn.
joe biden, president-elect for the united states: i am focused now on us
will mr. trump, going forward, respect barr's request for him to stop commenting on current cases, whether it's -- whether it's in terms of on the air, you know, public statements, or tweets?
unidentified male: nineteen of the 20 acting nominees are white people. no women were nominated for best director. that's fewer minorities than in donald trump's cabinet.
jobs to national security. and so i do think that there's a strong sense
meanwhile, in china, an aggressively nationalist country that if nothing else, definitely doesn't hate itself, authorities acted immediately and with force.
sanders: look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. but you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? he never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to officer singh of california's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. this shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.
green: i think what we, as a class, the freshman class, brings, particularly the congresswoman and i, is, you know, a life of service to the country. you know, she's prior military, i'm prior military and we want solutions. and we're just sick and tired of it not happening. and our constituents sent us here to get it done. so we're -- we're rolling up our sleeves and going to -- going to get it done.
schwedhelm: i think the u.s. has done a nice job in working through preparedness in the last year, but long ways to go. there's -- i'll go ahead.
a show trial. and, again, i don't want to get into this too heavily today.
bartiromo: secretary steven mnuchin joining me. coming up, the house voting to limit the president's war powers. minority leader kevin mccarthy will join me next with exclusive reaction. follow me on twitter @mariabartiromo, @sundayfutures, and on instagram
wallace: congressman, there are -- i -- i understand the reasons to vote
unidentified male: the intelligence showed that they were looking at u.s. facilities throughout the region. the threat was imminent. i saw the intelligence.
and joining us now, mick mulvaney, president trump's former chief of staff
he's not allowed on this show. she's threatened to send him to prison if he defends himself. meanwhile, he's being attacked daily by cnn. how can that happen in this country? i don't understand.
earth, what do you think you're going to be able to accomplish over the
wallace: jonah, this clearly, in the very first week that the house democrats took over and had done a lot of very careful things in terms of messaging, stepped on their message, the fact that we're talking about it, the fact that cable news has feasted on this. and i think, one, what do you think of that, and, two, the fact that this really indicate how much trouble nancy pelosi is going to have controlling some of the firebrands in her party?
the additional sanctions that we put on this week and the additional
was just telling you what the facts are.
as a result, i believe all members of congress should be required to obtain a security clearance that can be taken away if they violate the public trust.
be killed, including people that have been on president trump's legal team.
jarrett: it is a cause for concern because they're essentially asking for the senate to which is a jury to do the job of prosecutors in the house--
and this is with the chinese communist party trying to put their thumb on
i think the thing about joe biden is that a lot of people will give him the benefit of the doubt and they will think, well, joe means well. okay, like, he doesn't really -- he doesn't want us to be without jobs. he cares about us -- like, he has that.
trump: it was continued on by mayor bloomberg, and it was terminated by a current mayor. but stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of new york city, tremendous beyond belief. so when you say it has no impact, it really did. it had a very, very big impact.
tucker carlson: threats in the region. if you don't live in washington, here's the translation. that would be in hostile middle eastern countries, places where american troops would never be in the first place were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like max boot [spelled phonetically] and john bolton. but nevermind. no one in washington is in the mood for big picture questions right now. questions, the obvious ones, like is iran really the greatest threat we face and who's actually benefiting from this and why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit? by the way, if we're still in afghanistan 19 years -- sad years later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of iran? and so on. nobody is thinking like that right now. instead, chest beaters like senator ben sass of nebraska are making the usual war-like noises, the ones they always make. this is very simple, ben sasse wrote in a statement last night, general soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered americans, which is essentially true. soleimani was certainly a bad guy but does that make killing him very simple? it does not. nothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever very simple and any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. yes, soleimani was linked to the deaths of americans. nobody mourns his passing.
carlson: it might happen. washington is lobbying for turkey. if that's disqualifying, you've got nowhere to have lunch with as you know.
already happened that left five people that on wednesday, but that they
none of that was true, but saying it was less painful than rethinking the failed theology of globalism, so they went with it.
conway: the president thinks that andy mccabe should have been punished because he lied and he lied several times to the investigators and many people feel the same way.
mulvaney: yes, i think the 25th amendment is a very clumsy tool. we've
the u.s. justice department announced in october that it is investigating whether new york is undercounting coronavirus deaths among nursing home residents, and demanded detailed data from hundreds of private facilities. but as of this report, a senior justice department official confirmed to me that new york state has failed to provide any data as of their october request.
there's no doubt he's lost some -- and josh probably has a better read on
wallace: up next, reaction from a top house democrat - what's their plan to end the shutdown? and what about those calls to impeach the president?
a united statement against iran. this is a challenge and a strategy that president trump has laid out that
folds: i don't know. you know, like i'm -- if i was going to say, hello, chris wallace, you know, then i find it. so it would be, hello, chris wallace, how are you today. you know, like then i would -- i would find it on the piano.
speaking very directly to this for the first time on the senate floor. you
mccarthy: well, we first have to name the managers and vote on it.
tucker carlson, host: (audio gap) judge in the roger stone case has attacked this show by name in court today. i'll give you an update on exactly what she said and respond in just a moment.
elleithee: the president will -- will -- will cave and democrats will actually find a way to help him cave a little bit less painfully is -- is what's going to be really interesting.
jim antle: right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. and so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in afghanistan and syria, and the vast majority of republican senators voted to rebuke him. and in the case of syria, we're talking about a war that congress never voted to authorize in the first place. well, here we are in iraq, and we have most republican senators saying that they don't want congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. i think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of cold war 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped trump win in 2016.
wallace: it has to be the kind of compromise.
i've been saying this all week and i'm going to keep saying it. joining me now is ari fleischer, former white house press secretary, fox news contributor. also with me is tom fitton, president of judicial watch. ari, looking at trump's legal team, what's your take away?
perino: i think that it's showing that you have some -- i mean, think about bill clinton, right? i feel your pain. he didn't really, right?
cain: the answer is, they don't want to put up with the ostracism -- being ostracized by people who think that all blacks should vote democrat.
schemes. somebody may have just talked about it.
tucker carlson, host: good evening and welcome to tucker carlson tonight.
and our power player of the week, a fixture of the late '90s alt rock scene goes classical.
end of last year, we were expecting that there would be a snap-back
think it is -- the day of the signing, we will be releasing the english
the shutdown, which enters its 21st day friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.
conway: i'm not going to spend a lot more of my life on andy mccabe.
points this year. but we -- we look forward to very healthy growth in 2020.
i understand the issue with president trump and he certainly has reversed course a few times. what i'm asking you now, and this is -- we are in week four of the shutdown, so the situation has become dire.

bartiromo: how long are you expecting this trial to go? do you think that
america has moved on and we should have politics of belonging that welcomes everybody. that's what the american people are for. and i am saddened for what the republican party has become if they embrace that kind of homophobic rhetoric.

the irony is, is that there are serious public policy compromises that could be found here on daca. there are serious restriction, like my friend mark krikorian (ph), who argued for, you know, things like e-verify that are much more important than a wall. but the problem is --
we're going to protect our families, we're going to protect our children, and we're going to protect the industry, president trump said tuesday.
david spunt, fox news correspondent: chris, there was a very real
and our power players of the week. two new members of congress and how they intend to work across the aisle to get things done.
ingraham: lee, this is hurting clearly, if this goes at any length of time. even the last few weeks - the three or four weeks that this has been going on. this has to help biden and hurt those who are going to have to stay in washington during the senate trial. so, a lot of people think nancy in her own way is putting her finger on the scale against warren, against sanders and for biden. do you think there's anything to that?
stop here and now. he's taken a very churchillian stand, like churchill

the president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border. and here is secretary of homeland security nielsen. take a look.
michael anton, former national security council spokesman: well, the fundamental problem the democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. so it seems like all the energy on the basis is for bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.
meanwhile, president trump is enjoying the show from the white house. it sure looked like he was having fun friday during our interview.
graham: this is wrong, it's a responsible and will do damage to our efforts to fix a broken immigration system. this is a tremendous presidential overreach.

the number of working age americans without a job has increased by about 10 million in obama's first 5 years as president. that means each and every year of obama's presidency, 2 million more americans disappeared from the workforce.
and this is shocking, investigative journalist lee smith is going to tell us that he has evidence that the obama administration sent notes to the now deceased terrorists qasem soleimani and he's here exclusively with those details. wow. and my can't miss angle on the state of the 2020 democrat field, that's going to come a little later on in the show.

bernard kerik, former new york city police commissioner: well listen, i've been, you know, talking about this for the last year where i think the city, the state of new york is irresponsible in creating these laws where they're not holding people accountable.
folds: here's the happy version. hello, chris wallace, how are you today? we make it minor and it becomes sad because he has more work to do.

green: i think we find, you know, some common ground with what is border security and we get it done. i mean that's really what we have to do. and, you know, the president has looked at this and has said, this is what we need to do and, you know, i'm supporting him in this -- in this effort.

irrespective of what side of that question you'd be maybe on, you know
ingraham: so you live by the racial litmus test, you die by the racial litmus test. instead of focusing on who the best candidate is, whatever color or gender, background, democrats obsess on immutable characteristics. and they should never be the basis for promotions or jobs or political losses, not immutable characteristics, no. ever heard of merit or experience or political talent?
i can personally tell you, from the work that i have done on the southwest border, that physical barriers, that walls actually work, said brandon judd, the president of the national border patrol council, following brief remarks from the president.

america's progressive class is so busy talking up the supposed virtues of socialism, it has no time to acknowledge responsible efforts to address socialism's terrible wrongs.

kasraie: what most people don't know is that the regime intimidates people into going to these types of rallies.

he was told to stay home during the last government shutdown in 2013. but this time, he had little time to prepare for a missed paycheck or tie up loose ends with the cases he is working on, he said.
rao: the reason i can do all of this is because i'm a kid. kids come up
douglas macgregor: again, i hope so. we have to recognize that iran is a sovereign state. it has a sovereign government, whether we like it or not. if they tell us to leave, we should get out. absolutely. no question. and i think president trump should seize the moment, frankly, and get us out.
stier: well, it is the columbia school of public health here in manhattan. so it's pretty troubling and, you know, she got her piece placed on cnn.com, so at least, she has an outlet.

washington state – where the pair live and where amazon is based – is a community property state, as opposed to an equitable distribution state, like new york. in a community property state, all assets acquired during the marriage are considered marital property and subject to a 50-50 split. that means mackenzie bezos could be entitled to half of the entrepreneur's $137 billion fortune.

dana perino, fox news host: and then i wonder if the media organizations are going to send out a bunch of reporters all across the nation to find out what actually is happening in this country as they did after the 2016 election results.
she will have, i think, some challenges bringing together this moderate block of democrats who re-won the house in places like michigan. elissa slotkin, coming up later on the show, she's one of them. she is a moderate. she is not an abolish ice democrat. combine that with aoc and the liberal wing of the party, going into a presidential election --

juan williams, political analyst: well, i think it's pretty clear right now, if you look at the polls this morning, that the president and republicans are being blamed overwhelmingly for shutting down the government. and as chris coons pointed out to you this morning, chris, mitch mcconnell and the republicans had a unanimous support, republicans and democrats, for a bill that would have opened the government, kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward. it's the president who has made it a point to say, i'm shutting down this government over the wall.
guy benson of fox news radio; charles lane from the washington post; former dnc chair, donna brazile; and former trump national security council spokesman michael anton.
calling it the trial the century. he calls it the crime of the century. it
ingraham: just so everyone understands what he just said. john kerry, former secretary of state just said that iran deserves credit for being restrained and reserved after that attack, attempted attack on our embassy, after everything they've done to kill american soldiers, build ieds, the terrorism throughout the gulf region. our former secretary of state just siding with iran.
coons: well, that was a concerning, even alarming report and it suggests to me that the mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion. i'm grateful for the partnership of senator graham, now the chairman of the judiciary committee, in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with senators tillis and booker to protect the mueller investigation, and i think that report by the new york times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place.
stocks book five straight days of gains, exit correction territory.
ned ryun: we have entrusted them with political power and our monies to promote our interests, not the interests of non-citizens. i have to tell you, tucker, this is idiotic on so many different levels, but this is how red states become blue and how america ceases to be america. you can't continue this behavior. at some point there are consequences. these are red state republican governors doing this and trump is doing all the right things and they're abandoning him on this.

heather mac donald has thought a lot about this question. she is the author of the book, the diversity delusion, a frequent guest on the show, and she joins us tonight. heather, thanks so much for coming on.
wallace: so, let's -- you're exactly right. i -- you have voted for a border barrier in the past and i've been looking at your records, so let's put it up on the screen. in 2013, as part of comprehensive immigration reform, you supported $46 billion for border security, including 350 miles of new fencing. in 2018, last year, you and most senate democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.
wallace: i mean, in fairness, we heard congressman cicilline today say exactly that, and jerry nadler, who is the chair of the house judiciary committee, which is where this issue of impeachment, if it's going to come up, would come up, said the same thing this week.
the vast majority of the american people -- i saw the full results this
rove: well, he may -- he -- maybe he should do it in order to get us out of the boxed canyon, because if he does do it, it will go to court and quickly, i think, the courts will say, you don't have the authority in this instance.
prager: that's right, defensive line. you are right and that was a boo- boo.
let me tell you something: the way michael bloomberg treated employees, female employees who were under his wing, who were relying on him for their -- for their livelihood, for their health benefits, for their 401(k)s, to have created that kind of culture, that unsafe workplace, to feel that you're being harassed because of your gender, that is problematic, and i think you're going to hear more of it.
whitaker: there's a drug for that.

evidence. they're running around trying to get more evidence, because they
this isn't speculation. this is not propaganda from the evangelicals. it's social science. we know it's true. rich people know it best of all. that's why they get married before they have kids. that model works. but increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in america can afford.

but many users are unaware the cocaine or meth they consume is laced with fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, even in small amounts.
holmes: he basically played a role for eight years as minority leader in the senate were democrats control the senate.
j.d. vance: well, tucker, i'll give you a cynical answer and then a less cynical answer. i mean, the less cynical answer is basically that a lot of people just aren't very good and very smart at what they do and honestly i actually hope that's the answer because the more cynical answer is that as our country has successfully bungled or sorry successively bungled middle eastern wars and allowed china to rise, there is of course a group of people who've gotten very wealthy off of china's growing power and that's the financial elites who actually run the country who donate to the think tanks of course that produce the policy papers that so many of our politicians rely on and so i do think that one way of recognizing that there's been a massive failure here is that the people who have not been in service of the american national interests are still collecting a paycheck and the people who have gotten it right are still largely on the fringes and i think that's fundamentally a story of incentives and a story of who donors are benefiting from and who donors are paying to effectively issue what is propaganda.
as of now, there are going to be five white candidates on this next debate stage. is that sustainable for the democratic party?
yet, he won't lose access to this information because members of congress are far too often treated as a special political class, exempt from the rules that apply to the rest of our country. in this case, members of congress are granted access to classified material without needing to go through the extensive security clearance process used to determine access to classified information that every civilian and member of the military goes through.

bannon: he did economic war with the tariffs against china. he put
interpreted on twitter as support for the mob that attacked the capitol.
goldberg: right. and so i -- to answer the question about the pressure point thing, it seems to me that if you actually end up -- right now it's a lot of posturing from the tsa and their union. but it seems to me that if - - if -- if airports start essentially shutting down and rip people out and the rest of the country start to feel the bite, that is where i think the pressure really starts to build. that moves markets. that's going to cause congressman to start buckling.
guy benson, townhall.com: no, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the democratic party, right? here is a new york billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a democrat, and mike bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. all right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. that combination, is that going to sit well with the democratic electric? are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat president trump? that's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.
but that has nothing to do with what we're --
something had gone off the rails.
friday, with the jobs numbers coming out,although it is slowing down from
the answer used to be obvious. the overriding goal for america is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. but is that still true? does anyone still believe that cheaper iphones, or more amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from china are going to make us happy? they haven't so far. a lot of americans are drowning in stuff. and yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in gdp is an idiot.
i don't think mitt romney's going to challenge donald trump in 2020. that's just my instinct. i do think john kasich might. i think jeff flake might. and a lot will depend on the mueller report. this is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and once we get that, i think you'll see some republicans make some decisions about that primary.
trump: i think it's the most insulting thing i've ever been asked. i think it's the most insulting article i've ever had written.
that's why the bernie voters are not going to take that. i predict. he'll keep winning contests. he's like president trump in that he's got a committed base of loyal voters who aren't going to go elsewhere.
wallace: the president tweeted right after that came out: wow, bloomberg is a total racist, and he expanded on that in a radio interview with geraldo rivera.
shutting down the government is not a policy that should be followed, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told a boisterous crowd of protesters in washington, d.c., on thursday. some near the white house chanted, do your jobs, so we can do ours.

to this week's signing ceremony for the phase one of the u.s.-china trade
cicilline: i think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders. we have appropriated $1.7 billion over the last two years for border security. the department has spent less than 6 percent. but we are prepared to do more because we need to do more, but we want to do it in a way that's effective.
but i think the legislative path is just about shut off because nancy pelosi, the leader of the house, said, even if you open up the government, i will give you $1 for the wall. as long as that's the case, we are never going to get a legislative package no matter what the senate does.
your predecessor as white house chief of staff says he gave this advice to
j.d. vance: well, i think for a couple of reasons. one, we have an entire generation of american intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the middle east was just the most important region of the world. and so, one way of thinking about american policy really for the past 20 years, the george w. bush administration, of course the barack obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. we basically had one new war per term, iraq, and then -- excuse me, afghanistan, then iraq, lebanon and syria during the obama terms and that's obviously terrible and i think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for america's national interest but viewed from the chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for america's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that china was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. i think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the american foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.
sanders: -- they can try to do harm to americans, then he is not going to be the president that he knows himself to be, and he has shown himself to be over the last two years.
for example, disgraced national security adviser, john bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with iran and tonight, bolton may be finally getting his wish. should you be happy about that? that's the question.
and what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file fbi men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including andy mccabe, who are at the top levels of the fbi in 2016 trying to prevent donald trump from being president.
i'm living proof that capitalism, american exceptionalism, judeo christian values, faith in god, country and work ethic and the great american dream all work. but there is an evil plot to destroy them all.

listen to what barr said in that interview with abc. here he is.
ingraham: all right, and up next, it's friday, and you know that means. are the oscars too white and too male? and the royals make a play for hollywood, and we have video evidence. raymond arroyo breaks it all down, next.
in 2010, for example, mitt romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. he paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 percent. for normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. no wonder mitt romney supports the status quo. but for everyone else, it's infuriating.

bezos' most prized asset is amazon. he is amazon's largest shareholder with a 16.3 percent stake. if his wife gets half of that ownership, it could change the company's dynamics.
carlson: well, it is kind of the end of the road for identity politics. i mean, he is running on who he is rather than what he would do or what he believes in, but he's really going to have to for this to work, convince people that he is a biracial community organizer. i don't think he can pull that off.
prager: no, you said you did feed it.

but, you know, let me pick up with you, michael, on the point i was making with mayor buttigieg. you've got bernie sanders over here on the left and with elizabeth warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path. and, meanwhile, you've got this center lane all clogged up with buttigieg and klobuchar and biden and bloomberg about to get into it.

but first, the city of san francisco has just declared a state of emergency in response to coronavirus, and yet, you'll remember that for a month western leaders told us that the virus was under control and was unlikely to cause serious problems for anyone in our hemisphere.

laura ingraham, fox news host: i'm laura ingraham. this is the ingraham angle from washington, tonight. the senate might not be starting their trial today but the president is wasting no time. ari fleischer, tom fitton and matt whitaker are going to break down the new members of his legal team, the strategy that they're going to be employing. why democrats may come to regret demanding witnesses? we got a lot to unpack. also tonight, top 2020 democrats, they're struggling. hillary clinton's new documentary, and another biden looks to cash in on sleeping uncle joe. well, eric trump is here to react to that and how long can democrats deny the advancement for black america under trump and just how much of the vote of african-americans could trump capture? herman cain and leo terrell, oh my goodness, i cannot wait for this. they're going to debate this new wall street journal piece, it's making a lot of waves and it's friday so you know raymond roy is here. we got the oscars. apparently they're too white and to male. and also plus hypocrisy of course out completely out of control plus prince harry's embarrassing groveling to the disney boss, all caught on tape, we'll get all of that but first. as the senate jockeys over the rules for next week's impeachment trial, the president today announced his defense team and it's stacked with some serious legal minds.
whitaker: this is the first time that a president's been impeached where there's underlying crime and on a purely partisan vote. so we don't have any elements of those crimes with which we can compare the facts that were you know, sort of developed in the house and this is why this is a very troubling time in american history, if you take a step back and understand, we've entered a new era of partisan impeachments which is not good for our republic. and so i hope that the senators understand that and that they cannot turn this into a very partisan circus which is what we saw in the house.
here we have a president who doesn't really i think even know about it, and flouts it through social media, broadcasting his desire to see this or that person benefited by justice, somebody else should go to jail, and that, as bill barr said is totally threatening to that norm.
buttigieg: and if we light up this country, then everyone can make sure this country will now shine as a beacon around the world once more.
banning drugs doesn't stop teens or adults from using them. anyone who wants the stuff knows how to get it. one survey found that teens said it's easier to buy weed than alcohol. alcohol is rarely sold in schools, but banning marijuana creates fat profits that inspire dealers to recruit students to sell to their peers.
i got to ask you about that, because you are asking him, calling for him to
ingraham: but what about the progressive? as we've reported this week, an all-out war has broken out between radical hopefuls elizabeth warren and socialist bernie sanders and there's fact, it's likely going to get nastier. vermont's former governor, peter shumlin telling politico, bernie and his team feel they're holier than the rest. in the end they'll play dirty. even if he considers you a friend like elizabeth warren, bernie will come first. joining me now, eric trump, executive vp of the trump organization. eric, great to see you tonight. no wonder the democrats are pulling out all the stops to remove your father from office given what's happening in this top tier of candidates. it's wild - i've got to say this, it is wild watching this.
all right, raymond, thanks so much.

what caused this nightmare? liberals didn't even want to acknowledge the question. they were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner-city dysfunction and it made sense: big government. decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what conservatives called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.

i want to put up some statistics. in november of 2017, a year plus ago, the border patrol apprehended 7,000 family units at our southwest border. this past november, two months ago, they caught 25,000 family units coming across.
so i don't think the president has the authority to do that, and i hope you will continue to try to work with congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first. this -- the government will reopen when the republicans in the senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn't be shutting down the government if they don't get their way.
in fact, if anything, castro could have celebrated that is proof that immigrants assimilate into american study as they have for hundreds of years. that's a good thing. we used to be for that.

dana loesch: right, right. no, i agree. and by the way, i said harris earlier, and i have no idea where that came from, tucker. i mean, jack wilson. but this whole situation with legacy media and many other individuals looking down their noses at good people who want to be able to protect themselves. i mean, for crying out loud, let's look at maryland, for example. maryland, back in just a couple of years ago, when they passed their national firearms act, i think this is 2013, 2014. it was all with the promise that, look, law enforcement is going to take care of you. the state is going to protect you. you don't need your firearms to protect yourselves. and then look what happened. baltimore's homicide rate, their violent crime rate spiked by 300 percent. it's insane. people want to be able to defend themselves because they know that the state, even though the state promises them that they're going to do this, they never make good on it. in fact, some of the biggest errors that we have seen with previous mass casualty incidents had been because people in government have dropped the ball.

for democrats, supporting marijuana legalization is a way to mobilize young and minority voters. for all their charges that republicans are in the pocket of big pharma, marijuana will become a booming industry that will endear many cannabis workers, investors and users of the drug to the democratic party and its candidates.

in getting deservedly tough with maduro and his henchmen, trump was wise not to push for oil sanctions. hitting the energy sector would hurt the venezuelan people far more than their socialist masters—a tactic not calculated to lead to a new government more friendly to the u.s.

roberge: why? how does that protect -- you're trying to protect the public, though.
in his speech at riverside church just before thanksgiving, the governor said to always remember this advice when it comes to leadership:

trump: absolutely. we can do it. i haven't done it. i may do it. i may do it.

yes, there are about 400,000. they are going to lose their legal status soon. he's willing to extend that. the daca recipients, they are all tied up in court but i think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable if you could get wall funding.
johnny joey jones: well, i think it's impossible to separate the emotional appeal of killing someone who deserved to die and the overall strategic kind of cautionary tale of what are we going to do next? you know, i wrote for foxnews.com today that the tactical decision to send troops into iraq that i was a part of, the troop surge got the al-qaida out of al anbar, but would we do next? what was the strategic goal after that? same thing, i was a part of a troop surge in afghanistan when i lost my legs. we got the taliban out of the poppy fields, away from the opium trade, but what did we do the next day? and that was the problem, and i think a lot of this is that politicians that hold each other accountable, they throw each other under the bus. so, when we change presidents, sometimes we change policy for that purpose -- so that we can be a contrast, not necessarily more right or more wrong. and so, it's not so much that i take issue or really have an opinion over killing this guy yesterday. it's what are we doing next? what is the strategy, not the tactical, what did in this one operation, but what's the overall point here?
that you felt, quote, embarrassment and shame. do you feel any

boudin has defended his office's choices, saying that charging mcalister with a new, nonviolent crime would not have necessarily put the serial offender behind bars. he instead blamed law enforcement agencies, saying they could also have acted differently to avoid a terrible and devastating tragedy but vowed to make concrete changes in his office.
breathers need to be there. we can't worry about the decorum of the senate.
the whole thing is orwellian. and by the way your tax dollars are paying for it. the u.s. gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the who. it amounts to a huge percentage of their budget. so how do they spend the money?
but he was so ignored that he could say that and people were like, oh, yeah, okay. you know, whatever. i just want to ask you --
at the end of the day, chris, we're going to have a nominee by the end of march.
wallace: stay tuned to this station and fox news channel for the latest on the continuing government shutdown.
last week, the president praised the justice department for changing the way it's handling the case against former trump associate roger stone. stone was convicted in november on multiple counts of lying to congress. prosecutors plan to ask for a 7 to 9-year sentence, but senior justice officials overruled their recommendation and planned to push for a shorter sentence.
really a technical issue. and the language will be released this week. so i
convinced that goes away at all.

i would say the deep concern is, look, a general in the iranian forces being assassinated is not necessarily something to mourn or begrudge the u.s. getting involved in.
and elections have consequences. the rules of the senate were changed not by me, by them, and we had to do it on the supreme court because they would not give us any votes to nominate anybody and kavanaugh was a fine man, they tried to destroy him. all this is going to come back to haunt them one day.
and joe biden doesn't do any of that. he bypasses it and says something they could learn to code, which i think will come back to haunt him.

tucker carlson: i mean, just a macro question to end on. why is it so hard for our elites to police themselves? if someone is consistently wrong about the big things, why is he still in the same job? if we allowed our heart surgeons to keep working with that kind of track record no one would survive surgeries. so, why do we allow our policymakers to be wrong time and again?
want to ask you specifically about it. on november 7th, four days after the

the field has been whittled. and i think what we're left with now is not just left versus right, we're trying to make sure that we elect someone who will give us the kind of country that we deserve, not someone like donald trump. and, therefore, it is clogged. it is clogged.

holmes: yes, i think it's obvious, right? i mean if you're talking about a $4 billion discrepancy, there's got to be a way to get -- come to the middle of it. certainly if you were in the democratic party right now, there are concessions that you're interested in accomplishing, right? and if that is the case, you ought to wonder down to the speaker's office and minority leader chuck schumer's office and give them a piece of your mind.
and then starting 2020, starting an election year, she's coming out of the gate with a miscalculation with regard to these articles of impeachment and winning extra-long in order to send them over. a lot of miscalculations done by. i think it's going to be paid at the polls in november. and what she should be doing if she was smart, because she has all these democrats in districts that donald trump won. she should be talking about delivering them wins to go back to their district, but instead all those trump voters have to be fuming at these democrats who represent, because they didn't send them to washington to impeach the president--
wallace: he's still sharing his lightning bugs and spreading joy.
new articles of impeachment? and she said, well, let's just see what the

1963: the beatles' single please please me (b side ask me why) is released in britain by parlophone.
ingraham: well, i think they've divided up witness by witness and argument by argument from the constitutional to the fact based arguments so i think that's already in process. tom fitton, what we've heard from the media are cipollone is not a - he's not a media person. he's not done a lot of you know, sexy trial work so they're trying to like i guess, raise expectations, lower expectations for him. but i love the fact and you know, full disclosure, he's a close friend of mine so i know he's going to be fantastic but i love the fact that he's kind of an enigma to them because he's not someone who seeks the limelight. well, any basic research into his background, he's an experienced attorney. my guess is he can handle politicians in the senate and that process. you can see though why nancy pelosi didn't want the senate trial to happen and that's why she obstructed it because now you're going to have all these politicians that they have pointed as impeachment managers come over and have to deal with real lawyers. i fear we're going to have a kavanaugh type situation because in the ordinary course, the president's going to be vindicated in short order so they're going to think of ways to subvert that. this is why your motion for dismissal is a good idea. this is why they should knock schiff out because he's conflicted.
wallace: you called it punk rock for sissies.
so much work has been done to advance the cause with democrats that pro-pot groups are now turning their sights to republicans.
conway: article ii provides our president, yes, ladies and gentlemen, including president trump vast powers. and the president is making a point, and the attorney general bill barr is backing him up on this, that he has not interfered in any criminal case.

corke: from the situation room, rose garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the eisenhower executive office building, president trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.

wallace: is he really prepared -- it's still the same question, which is - - how serious is he? is he really prepared to go off on his own and use money that was authorized for military construction and build a wall instead?
coons: i think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. look, chris, you know me, i work with republicans regularly. i've been on the phone with a half-dozen democratic and republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by vice president mike pence.

so, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. but the fact of the matter is i think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.
bannon: well, no, but here's the reason.
and the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do american citizens harm.
graham: well, what president obama did, he didn't declare a national emergency about the daca recipients. he took his power to pardon an individual or a smaller group and applied it to 1.8 million people. ever president -- not every, a lot of presidents have declared emergencies. after 9/11, we did and they have taken money and powers to deal with a national emergency.
unidentified male: the democratic field is obviously big. it's more diverse than many other years.
there are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in america. in countries around the world — france, brazil, sweden, the philippines, germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. these are not isolated events. what you're watching is entire populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.

mac donald: because they're in the grips of a false narrative, which says that the criminal justice system is racist. this massive wave of de- incarceration, decriminalization that is going on across the country as you point out, tucker, is being done in the name of racial justice.

the president has shown a willingness to compromise. you heard it. in a funding request to the senate appropriations committee this week,he asks for items important to democrats, including, $800 million for humanitarian needs at the border, such as medical support and additional facilities to house migrants - which, frankly, a lot of americans probably think would be better spent on inner-city youth and on our veterans.
i think it was aoc's chief of staff who said the new green deal was really not about climate change, but changing the american economy along socialist lines. this had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, tucker.

police say troy mcalister, 45, was intoxicated when he ran a red light in a stolen car, killing elizabeth platt, 60, and hanako abe, 27. the san francisco police officers union says a plea agreement for a robbery set mcalister free on parole in april, and that boudin's office failed to prosecute mcalister's multiple arrests in the aftermath, including one dec. 20 for alleged car theft.

the fbi, the bureau investigating whether the president was a russian agent.
ingraham: the uphill battle that these democrats face is november isn't because they are not diverse enough. it's because they are not pragmatic enough. free health care, free college, free preschool, frozen fossil fuel industry, open borders, higher taxes -- it is not going to grow the economy. it's not going to grow your 401(k), your bank account, or whatever, as jill biden would say. empowering governments means taking away power from you. more power for the government means less freedom for you. by the way, it's the same government that thinks wasting millions on dead- end investigations and impeachment is more important than infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices. the 2020 democrat field of dreams has turned into a mud pit, one that most voters just want to avoid.

the evidence is clear: the mainstream media don't want the american people to know the truth about the ongoing tragedy at the border, so they fill the airwaves with misinformation and then accuse president trump and his supporters of lying when they state the facts that liberal journalists are so desperate to keep under wraps.

essential government workers, like tsa agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. while furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.

wallace: running workshops for tens of thousands of students.
dana loesch: no, i agree with you, tucker. and thanks for having me. i find it horrifying that anyone at usa today would actually find it horrifying to save lives, to defend innocent people, because that's exactly what happened. i was also, and the reason to remind everyone that we have this video to go by, is because sadly, the church was live streaming their service that sunday morning, as they always do, and it ultimately was captured. but you see in that video, tucker, there are about five other law-abiding individuals who also draw their weapons, which is probably what would happen at my church. and i'm one of the law-abiding people who carry in my church, and we are encouraged to do so. but five other people also drew their lawfully carried, lawfully owned firearms, and they held. they watched and waited and took in everything that was happening before then, which indicates a level of training and a skillset that shouldn't horrify people. in fact, it should encourage individuals, because we were always told that if there is more than one firearm present in an area such as this, that there's a mass casualty incident or someone armed comes in to do murderous intent, that it would turn into the wild west. well, it didn't. it took jack harris one shot and six seconds to neutralize this threat. god bless them and god bless texas.

and we're quoting now, the idealization of individual homeownership created the scorching landscapes we face today. individual homeownership should be seriously questioned.
but then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. and nancy pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides republicans, that peels off republicans. and the one thing that will keep republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. if it just becomes -- if the democratic party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the republican party, which i think is a real concern, of just the anti-trump party, than that will unify the republicans.

carlson: so what exactly will a coronavirus pandemic mean for this country? well, of course, you can't really say, it's impossible to predict with precision.
but republicans now represent rural voters. they ought to be interested. here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. all that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. in many places, women suddenly made more than men.

a country that listens to young people who don't live in brooklyn. a country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. a country where lewiston, maine seems almost as important as the west side of los angeles. a country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. a clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. and above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up in no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. a country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.

habitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught. with no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend.
wallace: guy, first of all, your reaction to donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general? or is it a bit of theater as some people have suggested, where barr is saying this because he needs to shore up his position at the justice department and there's kind of an inside agreement, tacit agreement between the white house and justice?
if you want to put america first, you've got to put its families first.
the order stated that if a hospital determined a patient who needed nursing home care was medically stable, the home had to accept them, even if they had been treated for covid-19. nursing homes could not test incoming residents to see if they were newly infected or perhaps still contagious.
and to my republican colleagues: stand behind the president as this is his last option. he ran on this as a centerpiece of his presidency, and it is a crisis. and if you don't see the crisis, you are not looking very hard.
kind of a brilliant documentary about the american anti-speech movement.
so i think people should be very wary of dismissing trump as somebody who
remove him. the resolution could be introduced as soon as tomorrow.
and we're going to listen to both sides. and then we will make a decision
but we have incorporated provisions in phase one that we think are
coons: well, frankly, i think the confirmation of justice gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end. what made the confirmation hearings of justice kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing.
there are also the whispers that cuomo has his hopes on an even higher office someday with a presidential seal. his victory tour continues while many of us watch in horror.
ago. i got elected to come up and try to solve problems.
tucker carlson: of course, of course. trust us. you'll be fine. yeah, okay, no thanks. dana, great to see you tonight. thanks so much.
i know, bolton is a bugbear for you. but in some ways, bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious. he actually was a bit of a problem for the iran hawk crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like robert c. o'brien, bolton's successor might actually be more effective at trojan horsing, what i think would be a tragedy in the middle east.
they did a great job. i just wish they had the leadership at the top that
jim antle: -- campaigned on the idea that we were going to shrink our footprint in the middle east. i think that's what he'd like to do. i think he's trying to balance the fact that he would like to do that with the desire to be tough. the desire to protect american personnel that are still in the region, but he has a lot of advisers who are committed to the things that he ran against. he has a lot of george w. bush retreads who are giving him advice on what to do with iraq and with iran, and the danger is that once you've done some of these things, once you've committed to some of these moves, you're going to draw more troops in rather than drawing down, as i think the president would prefer to do -- that there is no easy exit strategy; that there is no easy way out. so, the hope is that this strike is going to cripple iran's capacity to be able to threaten our people. we can move on, and if iraq does, in fact, decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, as was always likely once we put a shiite government in charge of iraq, that they were going to be friendlier to iran than washington was ever going to prefer, that we use that as a reason to get out, having accomplished everything that we're going to accomplish there.
president and then we'll decide later or the senate will decide later what
as that ruling works its way to what analysts say will be an inevitable supreme court showdown, newsom said he would reimpose it in order to subsidize state health care.
this entire impeachment gambit, it's just been an embarrassing failure from day one. so naturally, she's lashing out at trump. here's how she reacted when abc's george stephanopoulos showed her a clip from our interview.
up next, our power player of the week. you're going to want to watch this
hunter biden was doing. this all started with hunter biden.
this so quickly, before end of the year. and now nancy pelosi has been
cicilline: but i think the reality is this is actually a fight the president has created to distract from the real issues that he's facing. the fact is the republicans were in control of the house, the senate and the white house for two years.
we've see how fluid it is. of course i don't have billions of dollars of my own money to pour into the airwaves. but what we do have is a vision that as we've demonstrated in new hampshire and iowa, can bring people together in a commitment, as we come to more racially diverse states to speak to the concerns of voters who are here.
they have gotten president trump -- posters of president trump as superman
i see every single day that this economy is not working for average americans.
will bezos' divorce affect amazon? - the divorce of the world's richest man, amazon ceo jeff bezos, and his wife of 25 years, mackenzie bezos, could leave the fate of the pair's massive fortune - and amazon itself - potentially in the hands of washington state courts ... tmz reported thursday that the couple did not have a prenuptial agreement detailing terms of a possible split. that does not preclude the possibility there was some type of post-nuptial agreement put in place.
in california, people i interviewed said legalization made the streets safer. it's cleaned up the corner, said one woman. marijuana stores have a lot of security (and) pay attention to who's on the sidewalk.
terrell: it does. but let me ask you this, if blacks are coming out in droves to vote for trump, why do they have to whisper it? shout it. be proud. be proud.
tucker carlson: i don't understand how this works. well, so people who hate christianity are demanding that in the name of christianity christian governors admit refugees, but the governors aren't actually housing any of the refugees in their own homes or paying any of their own money so how is it christian virtue to take in other people's money by force and give it away?
wallace: one, why doesn't he just go ahead and do that? he seems to think that's a way out of this.
how can middle class people survive, without becoming dependent on government? ah, that's the point. government acts exactly like a drug dealer, hooking you on government checks for survival, just like drug dealers addict you to cocaine.
marie, is there some tortured reasoning there to ban president trump from
wallace: is this any worse -- is this any worse than the access hollywood tapes?
senator, welcome back to fox news sunday.
of course, the reason why you wouldn't tell someone is the fear that they're not going to give you any consent. so the state that talks about affirmative consent when it comes to hiv infection, all of a sudden they're saying, oh, you know, it's not that important.
wallace: are you, are the democrats willing to make a compromise that includes money for a border wall fencing -- a border barrier i will call it -- in return for some concessions from the president on people in this country illegally?
joe biden (d), president-elect: no one can tell me had it been a group of
and then all of a sudden, people started to complain about it and i spoke to a senator who told me that he had already pledged his support of this particular bill, but didn't actually read it or know what was inside of it.
more people in colorado tried marijuana after legalization, but that's not a surprise.
blower complaint this morning. plus, florida senator rick scott joins me to discuss the senate impeachment
ingraham: now, before we get back to victor, you said in this new piece of yours that the goal for the obama administration was never to stop iran from getting a nuclear weapon. it was to stop them from building it during the obama term. that's quite an accusation.
elleithee: and i do think it is premature. i think most members of house democratic leadership agree with that. most members of house democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way tom steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. there may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and bob mueller will let everyone know when that time is.
i spoke to two people who have talked to the president in the last 24
the rise of china. to appease the mullahs in iran. and that's why you saw
president trump ought to demand. there's no witness on the other side of bolton or mulvaney. there's nothing

to realize how fumbled the current vaccine rollout is, we can look to back to 1947, when a single case of smallpox in new york city led to a mass vaccination program of 6 million people in less than a month, using glass syringes as opposed to modern techniques.
carlson: well, assuming civilization endures until then, the south carolina democratic primary will be held this saturday. mark your calendars.
wallace: but again, mick, a lot of people say it didn't change on
wallace: i'm not talking about your statement, mick. i'm talking about why
and tucker, the president has been working on this from the day that he pulled down the planes from china on, i think, it was january 29th. we're focused like a laser beam on this to keep the public secure. we're hoping for the best, preparing for the worst and we're doing it all on trump time.
so i just wanted to again, commend you.
has gone on to solve some of the world's problems.
ingraham: -- promotions, military. we want all people to get an equal shot regardless of skin color, ethnicity, because the best is always going to rise to the top. and the new generation of americans, they don't even think about race. the really for the most part don't even think -- it's the most diverse country we've ever had.
statistics provided by the department of labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of december, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.
that confirmations have to happen immediately. and then paired with that is
really did believe that at the time.
be, act, and speak like a great president should, win or lose.
about the barrier on our southern border, this is the wall many will

donna brazile, fox news contributor: extremely.
now she's earned a new title. here's our power player of the week.
these fisas, she claimed, at the end of the year, which was great, oh, my

the important thing, tucker, in contrasting this with the china situation is, if it comes here, what you want to do is stretch out the amount of time where people get contagious and infected, that will give our healthcare system the ability to process that.
senator bernie sanders from the opportunity to become the nominee.
one of the biggest lies our leaders tell us that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. economics is a topic for public debate. family and faith and culture, meanwhile, those are personal matters. both parties believe this.
in new hampshire, the so-called moderate candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote of voters in that state, but -- which was double what bernie sanders got, but he won in new hampshire because he had that left lane, the more liberal lane, all to himself while the so-called more moderate lane was kind of clogged up by you and -- and biden and klobuchar, all of whom split up the votes.
unidentified female: he has a fractured skull. he has been sliced, like through his neck. he has a shattered arm. the doctors do not have high hopes for him. he may never be -- i mean, if he wakes up, he may never be able to walk, talk or even process speech again.
graham: well, number one, i wish her well and hope she recovers and continues to serve for many years. but here's what will happen if there's a vacancy, no matter from the liberal wing of the court, there'd be a lot of pushback from the left.
but there's no guarantee that that's going to be the case. and the big risk is that unwittingly, just as barack obama thought the iraq war was a mistake. donald trump thought the iraq war was a mistake, but the people end up doing some of the same mistakes, repeating some of the same mistakes that they campaigned against. what we really want to do is avoid an iraq-like war with iran.
as well. what about the nato countries, including france, that seem to be
those sort of stylistic things that people like john kelly just really
the question of additional covid relief for americans. he has talked about
joining me now is lee smith, investigative journalist, author of the plot against the president and victor davis hanson, senior fellow at the hoover institution.
deregulation, tax legislation, and the trade changes that you are making

purchases, and has a real enforcement mechanism. so this is a big win for
heather mac donald, author: thank you, tucker.
wallace: which indicates that the shutdown's going to go on a long time.
i was not afraid at all.
bannon: the reason he's being impeached is because of michael bloomberg's
on a larger scale, communities and cities may need to modify, postpone or cancel mass gatherings.
my finances, bank records and more were also scrutinized.
two. but this is the first time we have had a comprehensive agreement with
the senate, a razor thin majority in the house.
wallace: people who came in from disasters.
methamphetamine is still big business in minnesota and drug trafficking organizations bring meth to major metropolitan hubs like chicago and minneapolis then break down the product for mid-level dealers, said faribault police chief and violent crime coordinating council chair andy bohlen was quoted as saying. eventually, the drug continues to spread and ends up in all communities across the state.
fleischer: you know, what gave me so much doubt about watching him in those interviews that he was giving is, when people start to say, everyone's in on it. you know he had to be aware of it. everyone's aware of it and they offer no specifics. so he says the vice president was in on it, the attorney general knew everything about it, without ever saying, in a meeting on such and so date at such and so place, the vice president was informed by such and so. total lack of specificity so it's one of these sweeping generalizations statements that candidates make. witnesses don't because he didn't witness the specifics. he has nothing specific to provide and that maybe just shrug my shoulders and say this is a guy who curries up to anybody and everybody, he tells anybody and everybody what they want to hear. he did it with rudy giuliani and now he's doing that with the democrats and with their favorite tv shows so i don't think he'll advance the ball one bit.
we can't deal with utility or wildfire damage, then you say climate change did it and we've got to become socialists.
swamp isn't very big, but there are several million people that live in

iran, i think is a problem for the u.s. and its allies in the region. but it is not an existential threat, like china or russia. china or russia, particularly china would love to see another decade or two of americans my age, dying in the sand for no particular purpose.
the problem, tucker that we have now is if somebody has symptoms, they have to go to a hospital, take a sample, send it to a lab and wait 48 hours for that. what we're trying to do is adapt existing handheld devices to the coronavirus so that workers out in the field can get instant results.
we were in quarantine, unable to visit them, hold their hands or comfort them. my in-laws never had last rites performed by a catholic priest, they died alone. and, besides a quick graveside burial service, we never had a wake or funeral.
it is disturbing to consider that even as vaccine science itself advances so dramatically, the deployment of our new best weapon against the burgeoning pandemic might be better accomplished using a simpler more old-fashioned historical model.
trump: we can call a national emergency, because of the security of our country, absolutely. no, we can do it. i haven't done it. i may do it. i may do it. but we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly.
holmes: well, i think if you cut away from the sort of conspiracy and all the invective that this new york times article actually injects into our public discourse, what we've learned here is the mind-set of the fbi at the time. we learned nothing about the fact pattern that the president of the united states engaged in. in fact, we've known all of this for months.
wallace: i want to just pursue this emergency option one more time because in 2014, president obama used his executive powers to try and protect 5 million immigrants, and here's what you said at the time.
we would be president ultimately. that began to chip away. and as the
prager: no, i know. it's a horrible, horrible dilemma.
she is sending the articles for impeachment over to the senate. we're going
in the words of governor andrew cuomo himself, the guy behind this, 90 percent of criminal defendants will now be back on the street right after being arrested.
and i think to say that you're going to continue this for years over an argument, an immigration argument that is actually not proven to be effective, that is sort of in -- where there has bene a wall, we have seen breaches time and time again, almost 10,000 breaches among certain sectors of the wall that exist now. rather than taking that money and investing in actual technologies that would provide real border security, investigating in more border patrol agents, that, to me, seems like a better way to go.
turn their attention for the next few days on how they can fight back
ingraham: all right, gentlemen, thanks so much. great to see you both tonight. so what's next? what's going to happen next week? well, first, senators are going to vote on tuesday on the resolution we've been discussing this week, almost every night and that resolution will govern the rules of the senate trial. so set out length of questioning, rebuttal and so forth and now at that point, senators will be able to vote on whether individual witnesses will be called. there'll be a debate that happens and that's when things get very dicey. so if democrats get their way, they'll do everything in their power to exploit these witness votes.
the tech giants so eager to assert control over what is allowed to be shared don't have a great track record when it comes to deciding what information is accurate.
and the most interesting part of twitter's statement, actually, i think,
trump: listen, my father's a sponge. he watches everything. i mean his ability to retain information is incredible. it's the best i've ever seen so yes of course, he's going to be watching, i'm sure parts of it. but listen, these people are crazy. if you look at pelosi, right? i mean pelosi, i keep on saying is handing him the win. we're raising tremendous amounts of money. i was in ohio all day, yesterday. the amount of people that are coming forward, saying, listen, these people do not represent us anymore. we can't relate to these people and you know people see it for what it is. my father's signing trade deals with china. he's signing usmca. he's signing all these great deals. we've got the greatest economy in the history of the world. we've got the lowest unemployment that we've ever had. you know, 401ks are through the roof. i can go on and on and on and she's sitting behind a desk trying to impeach him because she knows that none of the candidates that we were just talking about before, can actually beat him, right? so this is their 'hail mary.' they're trying to throw a ball up. they know they're probably going to fumble it, at the end of the day. they know they're not going to win because you know no one on that stage actually has any sparkle. they don't have any twinkle in their eyes. they don't have any charisma.
wallace: well, let me follow up on that because kellyanne conway was, i think, trolling democrats and saying, boy, this part that talks about all of these principles in the me too era, are they going to nominate somebody like michael bloomberg with his record of things he's done, for instance, towards women in the workplace, just because they think he can beat donald trump? what would that say about what the democratic party really stands for?
rove: we can stay stuck in this and we can argue about nancy pelosi saying it's an immoral wall, which she voted for the wall last year and did not declare when -- when barack obama wrote -- built 133 miles of wall that that was immoral.
congressman chaffetz, there was an interesting development in the last couple of days. a few -- three, as i could them, senate republicans who were up for re-election in 2020 are now beginning to break with the president and say, we need to reopen the government. cory gardner of colorado, susan collins of maine, tom tillis of north carolina.
never used it under these circumstances. we typically used it when a
carolla: i have a slightly different feeling on it. yes, well, here's what i think. i feel like the pendulum is starting to swing back the other direction.
how well is this setting up for bernie sanders to be the democratic nominee?
prepares to take office in just ten days.
but there is bad news: the driving death rate increased in colorado and washington after legalization. but the data isn't clear -- driving deaths are up even more in some neighboring states like idaho, where weed is still banned.
look, the american people are not going to be fooled by anybody from the trump white house when it comes to these issues. so i'll leave it to my competitors in this race to speak for themselves, but one thing we can all agree on is that we can do a lot better than this president.
at the end of the day, though, democrats have said over and over again that they support border security, that they support protecting american citizens -- now, it's time to fulfill some of those statements that they've made -- work with the president, let's get this done; let's open the government back up.
and it's time now for our sunday group.
unidentified female: it's going to be an overwhelmingly white debate, an all white debate.
and what they did in this -- with these new laws where they're letting people back out on the street, it's going to diminish quality of life and it's going to enhance violence.
but frankly, diversity is the least of the democrats' worries, if you ask me. their top three candidates, those old white folks, they are struggling to find a coherent message, and at this point are just at each other's throats. the sanders campaign is reportedly telling volunteers manning the phone backs or knocking on doors to frame warren as the candidate of the elites. when she heard this, warren went on the warpath.
one, what do you make of tlaib's statement, plus her refusal afterwards to apologize? and how much of a fever is there in the house democratic caucus to move right now and impeach donald trump?
leadership that this president has been portraying. and there are a lot of
rep. elissa slotkin, d-mich.: thanks for having us.
i mean, look, that's why -- i said this last night in a tweet. the court
i know a little bit about the law. i practiced law a long time ago. it
ingraham: first of all, i don't think he said they were coming out in droves.
or some sort of superhero. this is the trump policy. it's ironic that, this
under our current system, an american who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate as someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. we tax capital at half of what we tax labor. it's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of our rich people do.
tonight, there seems to have been another big step toward that war. we will be asking a question nobody seems to be raising. is it a good idea?
ingraham: what is this? what's in the water in utah. that's my question. i love utah, so don't send me emails. what about this, gregg? there are reports that four republicans now want more testimony.
dershowitz: right. then it goes to court and the courts will decide.
ingraham: i just can't. sometimes, though, through all of that, sometimes voters probably just forget which biden is actually running.
secondly, there are a lot of your gop colleagues who say that would be a terrible precedent because someday, there's going to be a democratic president and they're going to say, well, you know what, it's a national emergency, so let's fund climate change. it's going to be a national emergency, so let's fund income inequality.
so i think that that's, you know, the potential to be a lot more contagious.
wallace: where are you both on donald trump?
impeachment if vice president mike pence decides against invoking the 25th
ingraham: yes, speaking of biden's brother, you referenced it and the $1.5 billion from china, he got right for his fund, it was not clear that it went to him personally but that's what we want to find out. we want to find out exactly how much he personally profited hunter biden which i don't think anyone really knows but it's obviously a lot of money. joe biden's brother has been caught now, you've referenced in passing, trying to profit off of his family name, just like old hunter. abc news reporting, frank biden touted his famous last name and prominent connections in washington to help land a series of charter contracts from local officials in florida to open charter schools, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars over a five-year period. they brought him in for his name one critic said. well, eric you made all the money and then your family went into politics, not you but these folks are doing it the other way around. they had no money. they went into politics and then their family members cashed in.
clyburn: absolutely. and i think that everybody in the country,
sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., minority leader: this is ridiculous and it's cruel and it needs to end now.
look, this is a guy -- i mean, what else can you do now? but it's not just that. it's tweets that were similar with that speech. he was tweeting the same out, but it's also the cadence. it's not even just plagiarizing the words. it was the rhythm of the delivery, and even some of the gestures, the way that he held his face.
as artistic adviser to the national symphony orchestra in washington, his late night sold out declassified concerts are the platform for his special mix.

this election isn't about any of us candidates. it is about voters' lives. and we're the ones trying to get voters a raise. we're the ones trying to make sure that there is paid family leave, working to end endless war, serious about climate change --
it was the democrats looking for an excuse and they found one line in a
carlson: it doesn't seem like he is.
that's one of the other benefits. it's sad perhaps for the pete supporters, but this is what i think also is insulting. he has got about i think 10 percent now black support in south carolina. it is that he may believe here, that if he copies an african-american who is well regarded by the black communities here in america, that he can somehow trick them into voting for him.
could become their nominee, because he will be stuck in a chair, because
and the question is, why not sign that bill, fund those agencies that have nothing to do with the border wall, and not hold those hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and the services they provide, hostage?
unidentified female: thanks so much, we are here with senator kamala harris, who, of course, a former 2020 presidential candidate and one of the jurors in this trial.

ingraham: when we come back, president trump and lsu's coach o, a dynamic duo at the white house. do you think they got along? find out next.
this is a guy who wants to be president, who doesn't even have the confidence to be himself. this is a man where there's apparently has no confidence in his own ideas or his own rhetoric or his own ability to inspire people.

on thursday afternoon, the senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown. according to statistics provided by the department of labor, 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of december, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.
senate. when would you expect that?
wallace: you both talk about trying to get things done, trying to compromise, to break the gridlock in washington. be specific.
whether or not they were up there before, whether they got some other
ingraham: it's supposed to be about them, mr. president. i'm just teasing. did you notice, by the way, coach o gave him the nicest fist pump there? that's what i like to see. that's all the time we have tonight.
slotkin: i think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that i love. and, for me, that's critically important. i don't like policy by twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. if we're only anti-trump, we are not doing our job.

plus, is the white house already preparing its supreme court short list in case justice ginsburg steps down from the court? all that, next.
the sacramento bee reported on several of newsom's recent hires, which seemingly signaled he's serious about his push to bring universal health care to california. chief of staff ann o'leary worked in former president bill clinton's administration on the children's health insurance program (chip), which offers affordable health care to children in families who exceed the financial threshold to qualify for medicaid, but who are too poor to buy private insurance.
the first daughter confirmed a wednesday report during the summit that president trump will soon be proposing a $42 million budget increase for 2021 to support victims and efforts to prosecute criminals who take part in human trafficking.
and when it comes to lgbtq issues, this is, i think, the most important thing is not the treatment of candidates, it's what's happening to individuals and families across the country from brave service members who have their careers threatened --
on the streets of the world.
we need to increase the number of refugees that we take into this country.
sanders: as we've said for the last several weeks, we're looking and exploring every option available that the president has, whether --
we're ok with that? we shouldn't be. libertarians tell us that's how markets work -- consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. ok. but it's also disgusting. if you care about america, you ought to oppose the exploitation of americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on wall street.

wallace: up next, how long will the shutdown drag on? we'll bring in our sunday group to discuss the deadlock and when most americans will start feeling the pain.
but drug warriors are not convinced. paul chabot, a former anti-drug policy advisor for presidents bill clinton and george w. bush, tells me that legalization has been a disaster.
wallace: should president trump be removed from office in these final 10
october. at that time, we moved into impeachment in the house.

wallace: well, of course, the question is -- is the wall the best way to do it? and i'm going to ask you about that in a minute.
wallace: so why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?
and we'll find out what house democrats hope to accomplish from congressional leader david cicilline.
wallace: that's 16 days from now. some white house officials are talking about this extending into february.
negotiations to end the shutdown stalled on thursday, as trump, during his visit to the u.s.-mexico border in texas, argued a barrier made of steel would deter human trafficking and other violent crimes.
shutdown reality sets in: approximately 8,000 federal workers on friday will face their first payday without a paycheck due to the ongoing government shutdown ... roughly 420,000 employees have been deemed essential and are working unpaid. an additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the white house and across the country on thursday to end the shutdown.
wallace: now, you are telling the president, urging the president to use his executive powers to fund the wall and the president on friday said not so fast.
carlson: poor guy. we feel guilty even running that sound. but it gets even worse. last week, biden told you that he was arrested in south africa for trying to see nelson mandela under apartheid.

in new york, where democratic gov. andrew cuomo and new democratic majorities in the state legislature are pushing for legalization, a recent proposal even espoused the laughable proposition that revenue generated by pot legalization could be used to fix the new york city subways.

and i'm sensitive to cory gardner, who's a great member of the united states senate, but now is the -- congress always gravitates to deadlines and pressure points. and that's what i think is ultimately going to get this solved is the need, the desire to solve this now rather than continuing to punt it down the road.
american crisis landed on the new york times bestseller list in october and has lined his pockets as he continues to profit off the deaths of tens of thousands of new yorkers.
so we'll learn soon from mueller what's going on here.
my life didn't start out looking very hopeful, she said. i was born into a situation that set me up to fail. at the age of 8, i was introduced to drugs, and at the age of 12, i was exploited. ... i thought this was just the way that life was supposed to be until about five years ago when she was discovered by wellspring and taken in for recovery.
but here's one forecast that caught our eyes from the atlantic. it is titled, you're likely to get the coronavirus. that piece quotes extensively a harvard epidemiologist. the article describes him as a cautious professional, the kind of person who carefully considers every word and then backs it with data.

and so, it was partisan in the house. they created the rules of engagement, making it partisan, rushing to judgment and then delaying judgment and suddenly they expect the senate to ignore partisan affiliations. in an ideal world that would happen, but in the political world created--
he later appeared on an iranian news program to reassure the country that everything was under control, and then he coughed on the woman interviewing him.
in 2019 he issued an executive order allowing cities and states to opt out of refugee resettlement. that's the last time we checked in on this story. here's the amazing part. for some reason no republican governors are taking advantage of that. instead, you probably didn't read this in the new york times but 18 republican governors have explicitly requested that more refugees be sent to their states. have their voters demanded this? no. so what's going on here? ned ryun is the founder of american majority and author of restoring our republic. he joins us tonight. so, ned, i don't think there's any evidence that republican voters in the states have been begging their republican governors to move more refugees in. so, why are these governors literally asking the federal government to do this?
wallace: and -- and in 30 seconds, is bernie sanders a suicide pact?
the governor, it would seem, is a big fan of props. at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, he introduced a wall of masks during a press conference while hospitals were complaining of ppe shortages. then in may, his giant q-tip comedy routine with brother chris began on cable news. the governor also had someone make a bizarre giant plastic covid mountain to go with his poster demonstrating at a press conference how he had flattened the curve of coronavirus cases in new york.
ingraham: the most important thing about this, and we are going to get to mark in a second, the most important thing people have to understand, an assault style weapon -- people hear that and they think, oh, my god, a machine gun. no. what is an assault-style weapon under the statute? as i'm reading the statute, it's any semiautomatic weapon that holds 10, correct, 10 in the clip, 10 or more in the clip? most sig sauer, we have pictures of them, sig sauer 9-millimeter, glock 9 millimeter, ars, ak style weapon, the most popular hunting rifle in the united states is the ar-15, correct, depending on the size of the clip would be banned, those style guns?

that's not surprising. romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called bain capital. bain capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. romney became fantastically rich doing this.

i can't get inside his head. it's obviously a sore subject for him politically, and maybe personally, too. admitting to a significantly higher death toll in nursing homes will undercut his self-image as an effective leader in a crisis, confirm that he has been distorting statistics and hiding facts, and give ammunition to his bitterest political enemies. flouting the freedom of information law looks bad, but he evidently calculates that the alternative is worse.
