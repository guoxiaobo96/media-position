Then, in late August, I was invited with my husband and his sister Donna to join many lawmakers in Albany to push legislation to create an independent commission to investigate the nursing home deaths. The passage was sponsored by Sen. Jim Tedisco, R-Glenville, and Assemblyman Ron Kim, D-Queens, in hopes of establishing a panel with subpoena power to perform a top-to-bottom review of the deaths reported in New York's elder care facilities at the height of the pandemic.

Thirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and many other places and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal.
And jobs? You were told in June we created 288,000 new jobs. What the media forgot to tell you is that 525,000 full-time middle class jobs were LOST in June and 800,000 part-time crappy low wage jobs were created. Does that sound like good news to you? No, it's more murder of the middle class.

There has been no factual basis for these allegations against Joe Biden to ask the Senate, do these investigations that the President fraudulently sought to get Ukraine to conduct would merely turn the Senate trial on its head. Now that's something the President would love. But that's not a fair trial. That's a sham trial.

So thank you, President Trump, for having moral courage to make such a hard decision.

The problem is that socialist theory provides no checks and balances in socialism to keep the ideology from devolving into what Churchill called the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy. In practice, power to the people in places like Venezuela quickly starts channeling into more and more power in the hands of government.
Ned Ryun: This is unreal, Tucker. I mean, again, you pointed out that Trump gave him a strong backstop back in September and said you can opt out of this with his executive order and now you have these 18 Republican governors saying no, we want more. And they're saying well, we're following our hearts. This is, you know, Christian charity in action. I got to say this, Tucker, as a active devout evangelical Christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with Christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors and quite frankly a perverse incentive for these government-funded charities that are acting as refugee contractors grifting off the American taxpayer. Michelle Malkin has written about some of this but the U.S. State Department is paying these refugee contractors over $2,100 per refugee of which they get to keep 45 percent and then they're doing this campaign on these governors saying you have to put your Christian charity into action and in an act of cowardice most of these governors from red states are giving in to this. First of all, --

The development is, in part, an outgrowth of the crackdown on opioids in the U.S., and the result of cartels finding other drugs. The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment (NDTA), released last fall, noted the rise of more potent forms of meth and cocaine in the United States.
Our leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other.

You can do it in a church where we have a person licensed to carry weapons as we had in Texas or Florida where people are allowed to carry a weapon that has an extended clip in it that's 10 or 12. And you can defend a lot of people getting killed with a clip that's 10 or more period. So the idea the government is going to tell you that you can't defend with a type of clip or magazine is obscene.

But just hours ago, Warren went on record saying it's true, and that Sanders, quote, disagreed during their meeting that a woman could win the nomination.

CICILLINE: Look -- I'm not going to -- look, it's kind of odd to hear people on the Republican side who have not condemned the president's language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language. Like, look, this is a private event, she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate. The fundamental issues Democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we're going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives, and we're going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way.
Why? Because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in Washington.
President Trump is also requesting $675 million for new technology to detect and stop the flow of illegal drugs over the border. Democrats have long said they wanted that. But Democrats don't want to have an honest conversation about border security. They are now the party of obstruction, and everything must bend to their resist Trump goals. The Hill reports that their latest strategy is to jam up the Senate by refusing to consider any legislation until the government is reopened.

So here's the question: I understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of Democrats, including Pelosi, including Schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. So why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that Lindsey Graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on Dreamers and on TPS immigrants?

Then Jackson herself lied about the case. She claimed that Stone had been prosecuted because he covered up for the President, when in fact the charges against Roger Stone had nothing to do with that.
KASRAIE: The government of Iran has about 4 million employees. So obviously they gave the employees the day off. A lot of people that you see there are from rural villages. They bus people in, they give them incentives like food. And as you know, right now, the economy in Iran is plummeting. People are hungry, they are jobless. The value of the dollar has decreased tremendously. So the people that you see at the rally not only are paid to be there, but they are intimidated to come.
Yet again, however, the Pelosi Doctrine is do as I say, not as I do.
CHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. And let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if Biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. And he, so far, has not delivered.
These are just a few examples of many that show a clear trend: Speaker Pelosi is more interested in maintaining her position atop the Washington, D.C. political class and satiating the radical desires of her followers than protecting our country's national security.

In the meantime, Cuomo's excess regulations and prioritizations and threatened fines clearly slow the wheels of progress towards widespread vaccinations that will lead to herd immunity.

The economy is in crisis and collapse. The GDP for the first quarter was NEGATIVE 2.9%, one of the worst showings in history, six years after Obama's trillion dollar stimulus promised to save the economy. That stimulus went to Obama's voters (the poor) and Obama's donors (the super rich). But the bill (in the form of debt) goes to the middle class for decades to come.

I'll tell you what happened, I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally Democratic, but socially conservative community. More than I had the first time that I ran for office.
And what really happened was that infusion of cash and the cessation of those sanctions created a terrorist whirlwind from Iran into Lebanon, into Syria, into Yemen. And they're embarrassed about it, because this plan was bankrupt, it was crazy. And I think Secretary Pompeo and Trump realize that and yet they know that our real interests are in China with - in dealing with China and there's existential threat. So, they're sort of like sheriff's backing out of this Middle East saloon and saying, this place is a mess, but we're going to have a revolved result and restore deterrence. And that's hard to do.
It wasn't fine. We know that now. At least 35 countries have confirmed cases of coronavirus as of tonight. Last Friday, Italy reported six, yet at midday today, they had 283 and then by tonight, that number had risen to 322. That is a steep trajectory.

But I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.

CICILLINE: I mean, I think we believe the government must reopen immediately. I mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the TSA. I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.
WALLACE: Wait, wait, wait -- I know the statistic; I didn't know you were going to use it. But I studied up on this.

On this broader issue of Barr and the Democratic reaction, I think your question was good. Have the Democrats learned their lesson? We have people talking about impeachment of Bill Barr, which I think is ludicrous.
Lee, you say there is a reason that the Obama officials seem very upset over the killing of Soleimani.
My friends, like everything else, this is all about politics for the Democrats. Pretty much every demographic group is doing better now than they were a few years ago. The Democrats don't have any have no answer. They've completely given up trying to outdo Trump on raising the standard of living for Americans. So, all they have to run on is this shutdown and their opposition to his wall. Oh, and Trump's a racist. That's all they have.

Tucker Carlson: They're thinking, let's get some. That's what they're trained to do. That's their job. Their job is to be there, be ready and to not question so much why as to how and when. That's their job. But when they go, and they experience war like I've done twice and they come back and maybe they have an injury, maybe they lost buddies. They get 10 years older, 10 years wiser. They pay attention a little bit more to politics. And they say, Why was out there? What was I accomplishing, and what was I told? And how much of it was true? I think President Trump at this very moment is as inclined for military as he is diplomacy. And he's thrown the ball in the court of Iran today with a tweet to say, Listen, you're not going to win a war, but you might win at the negotiating table, because I think that is his end goal. And he may have made it through advisers or through his own wisdom to the point that he understands maybe that's all Iran will respond to. That's our hope. That's our hope today. Is that Iran responds to military force. We really don't have a playbook to see if they will, and it's quite a risk and a gamble. And it's ultimately the gamble of men and women just like myself.

President Trump now says the government shutdown could go on for months or even years. With the standoff over the border wall now in its third week, White House officials and congressional staffers met Saturday to work towards a deal, but prospects for a breakthrough remain dim as the new Democratic majority in the House seems determined to stand up to President Trump.
Obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.

Benjamin Hall: Yes. Good evening, Tucker. As you point out, the whole region has been on high alert all day, waiting for some kind of retaliation from Iran. But actually, what we heard reports of in the last couple of hours are possible strikes by the U.S. These are unconfirmed, we've heard conflicting reports. But there are suggestions that two cars were hit just north of Baghdad a few hours ago and that they contained more Iranian-backed Shia militias, including a key finance facilitated close to Qasem Soleimani. But of course, it is Qasem Soleimani that everybody is talking about. The head of the Al Quds Force, some people say the second most powerful man in Iran and the man responsible for so many hundreds of U.S. deaths. He was killed leaving Baghdad Airport early this morning, having flown in from Lebanon. A U.S. Reaper drone was waiting to take him out. And alongside him, the man who was in charge of the storming of the U.S. embassy. Five others also killed there. People are saying now that this strike may really severely strain U.S.-Iraqi relations. And in fact, the Iraqi prime minister spoke out earlier today and didn't mince his words. He said he condemned the targeting killing as a violation of the terms which underpin the U.S. troop presence in this country. And he went on to say that he has submitted a formal request for parliament to convene in order to adopt necessary measures to protect Iraq's dignity and sovereignty.

Cocaine overdose deaths rose to about 14,500 in 2017, twice what they were in 2015. Some areas of the country have seen a sharper rise in cocaine- and meth-related deaths.

TRUMP'S EX-'FIXER' TO TESTIFY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney, has agreed to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Feb. 7, almost exactly one month before he starts serving prison time for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress about Trump's past business dealings in Russia ... In a statement, Cohen said he accepted the invitation to appear from Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's chairman, [i]n furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers. Cummings said the committee was in the process of consulting with Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller's office to ensure that Cohen's scheduled testimony would not interfere with the ongoing investigation into interactions between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.

But I don't think it's the case that, oh, therefore if they had found something right away it would have led to immediate charges against this president.
TRUMP: I think that's what they believe, at the same time as I said before, he can't get through a sentence without stumbling. He's got real problems. I mean here's a man that was in the Senate for longer than I've been alive, Laura, right? Yet he blames all of America's problems on my father. It's kind of ironic how that works. Here's a guy who gave Iran $150 billion. They ended up building missiles that they did shot at one of our air bases. Here's a guy a guy who has a son, who profited in you know off of the presidency of the United States, of a vice presidency of United States, took $1.5 billion from China just a couple days ago. ABC reported that his brother was doing the same thing as it came to charter schools in Florida. This guy's got a lot of problems. This guy has a lot of problems aside from the fact that he lacks charisma and again, he hasn't exactly been a good mouth piece for them because he keeps on stumbling and going off on these terrible rants. He's got real problems.

Human trafficking is believed to be one of the largest-scale crimes in the world, with 24.9 million people trapped by human traffickers who make more than $150 billion in annual profit for the industry, Ivanka Trump said, adding that there are no demographic limitations to human trafficking, which exploits society's most vulnerable populations like women and children.

Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.

The President has been focused on an agenda. He has a team. He's got Tony Sayegh, Pam Bondi, Patsy Baloney (ph). They've got great people to White House focus on impeachment. But the President himself is focused on an economy that is ripping right now. On the national security front, he takes out Qasem Soleimani and the Democrats are so invested into hating Trump that they can't root for the Iranians, the millions of Iranians who want to pursue a new direction and they're trying to make the President look bad, taking out Soleimani.

If they wanted the government reopened the Dems could negotiate with the president and reopen it tomorrow. He's already compromised on the structure of the wall and dropped his asking price. And while the Democrats feign concern over spending a few billion on a border wall - $5.7 billion - the Coastal Wonder Twins of their party, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Mayor Bill DeBlasio of New York, have all kinds of money — they'd spend pots of money - for the health care of illegal immigrants. They have no problem finding pots of money to spend on the well-being and health of illegal aliens.

BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. Look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. But the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to Washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.
I put forward this proposal to be included in the rules package for the House of Representatives this week, which are the procedures that the House of Representatives will operate by for the next two years. Apparently to defend Rep. Swalwell and other members who leak information to their allies in the liberal media, Speaker Nancy Pelosi blocked my amendment.
BRUCE: Well, that's it. I don't think he can, too. He wants to run as being who he is as a gay man, but then he also wants to run as being someone else. And that's really breaking the barrier when it comes to identity politics, isn't it?
A peace process between the Colombian government and rebels had the unintended result of spawning more land use for the production of coca leaf, as the previous president stopped aerial fumigation meant to destroy coca crops. Farmers then switched to coca in the hope of qualifying for a government offer to compensate those who were growing the crop.
I know you obviously have a lot of experience with this individual. The
Congresswoman Harman, how do you answer Greg?
MAC DONALD: They're scared. I mean, they're absolutely terrified of the racism charge. I was at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that talked about the criminal justice system. I was very disappointed in the Republicans. They just spouted bromides about our men and women in blue without actually combating the lie that the criminal justice system is racist.

Stone received more than three years in prison. He'll be over 70 when he gets out. Officially his crime was lying about e-mails, e-mails that were themselves entirely harmless.
But I think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. It doesn't achieve the objective. Democrats are committing to securing our borders. We have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.

Iran has confirmed 15 deaths plus 95 cases, although the real number is believed to be higher than that. One of those infected is the country's own Deputy Health Minister, who was seen sweating profusely on Monday at a press conference downplaying the outbreak.
PRAGER: I think he is right about the comedic community. That's correct. Outside of that, I don't think it's true. San Francisco 49'er color announcer -- and I'm not sure you could use that term any longer -- simply said in describing the Baltimore Ravens quarterback who is a terrific quarterback and who is black and he said, you know, there might be the slight half second advantage in a handoff because the ball is black and the uniform is black and he is black. So the offensive line doesn't see it quite as quickly.
They have never been in this position, Maria. Iran has never been in a

FITTON: I've been calling it the 'Gossip Girl' impeachment and Parnas has more gossip to add about things we already know about, that Rudy Giuliani was concerned about corruption in Ukraine. I don't understand what the news is here. Parnas is not providing any evidence of impeachable acts by the President of the United States. It's interesting in the gossip oriented way but the idea that he has any evidence to provide the Senate and that's one of the big issues here. You talk about a senator saying we have to consider the evidence. They don't have any evidence.
TRUMP: If he fought really hard against President Obama, like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you?
WALLACE: Well, wait, wait, let me -- let me -- as the shutdown drags into its fourth week, both sides are digging in harder than ever. Take a look.

Tomorrow, we're going to try and follow up with the idea that Chelsea Clinton is a Public Health Professor weighing in on the coronavirus. That ought to worry you.
CONWAY: Well, a couple things, very different to pick up the phone and ask your attorney general to do something in a criminal case, the president hasn't done that. He had -- he says he hasn't done it, Bill Barr said he hasn't done it, he hasn't done it.
Attorney General William Barr takes an unusual public swipe at President Trump over his criticism of the Justice Department.

INGRAHAM: Eric, the 'Real Clear Politics' average right now. Joe Biden, despite their attempts I think to kind of knock him down a peg or two, he's still way up there. 27 percent. Now this is a national poll so people focus on state by state so I understand but still an interesting snapshot. Sanders is at 19. Warren's at 16. Buttigieg, who we've relentlessly seen pushed by the media and Hollywood, way down below everybody at 7.2 percent. So is this Joe Biden's to lose in my view. Politico, I think it was Politico had a headline today, you know, they - all their efforts have to not. Biden's still at the top of the heap. Doesn't he have appeal to African-Americans and more middle of the road Democrats, maybe even some independent? You're worried about him, aren't you?

One of the challenges of negotiating with President Trump, as Lindsey Graham knows better than anyone else, is I feel like I've signed up for the Trump of the day club. I don't know what position we're going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two. It was Senator Graham who famously talked about Tuesday Trump and Thursday Trump when he and Senator Durbin brought a comprehensive resolution, a bill, to President Trump last year, he embraced on Tuesday and then walked away and announced it on Thursday.

Now, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war. And we have to say it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades.

ROVE: No. And we have a disconnect between I -- what I thought was an excellent speech by Pompeo. He opens up by saying, America is a force for good in the Middle East. Repudiates the Obama era doctrines. But there is a disconnect between that and pulling us out of Syria.
When coronavirus first broke out in China, China refused to admit international health experts into their country to assess it. To this day, it seems likely that China is lying about the number of infections and the number of deaths. Yet despite this, Tedros has publicly praised the Communist Chinese party for transparency.
It's all the doing of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, his successor Nicolás Maduro, and their fellow kleptocrats.
Congresswoman, I mean this was such a sore point when the president said we're going to pull out that James Mattis, the defense secretary, quit over it. Now they seem to be reshuffling it. Do you understand what the policy is?
There's White House Counsel Pat Cipollone; Trump's personal attorney, Jay Sekulow and just today, frequent guests on this show, it's like one of our legal panels, Ken Starr, Alan Dershowitz and Robert Ray, all added in various capacities. There's also Jane Raskin and Pam Bondi, both formidable female attorneys, they're just great attorneys, forget whether they're female or not. So you compare that all-star line-up, serious legal people, astute legal minds to the partisan hacks that Nancy Pelosi tapped for the prosecution. While six out of seven impeachment manager's hand-picked by Nancy, supported impeachment even before the whistle blower complaint. How's that for impartial? Further Schiff and Nadler and company couldn't prove that Trump committed a single crime and that's despite rigging the entire house inquiry and having the media in their corner. So do we really think Schiff is going to be somehow more convincing in the Senate chamber than Alan Dershowitz, a constitutional scholar who just so happens to be a liberal who didn't vote for Trump? Well, it's going to be a blow out for the Republicans and we're going to be covering it every step of the way. But here's the thing, the trial should even get this far. Mitch McConnell needs to put a motion to dismiss in the resolution that is going to govern trial rules. Now this impeachment is a complete farce, letting the trial play out with only validate the House's unconstitutional abuse of power.

In theory, under socialism, the community as a whole owns or regulates all the means of the production and exchange. The idea is that this will assure that the working class controls the economy and gets its fair share of its benefits—the goods and services they produce.

GRAHAM: Let's start with the president. I ask him, Mr. President if you want to go down the emergency path, I stand with you. He said just 30 minutes ago, that's my last option. I think the legislative route is the best way to go, let's make a deal, but I will do it if I have to.

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): The precedent in impeachment trials in the Senate is to have witnesses. To have no witnesses would be a dramatic break with precedent. It would mean the first impeachment trial of a President in history with no witnesses. The first impeachment trial of anybody that went to completion in the Senate's 200 and some odd year history without witnesses.
Pretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included. What does it mean?

MSNBC, in other words, saw no substance in letting the American people hear what the real experts had to say about border security.

We fought ISIS in Syria and then for some reason stuck around. We're still there. We joined humanitarian missions in Lebanon and Somalia. Our special forces have been quietly fighting in Yemen, Pakistan, Niger, who knows where all else. Many other places. In every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. The benefits? Often, they've been non-existent. A lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. Certainly, they did. Hope that makes you feel better. What do the American people think about all of this? Not that anyone cares. Well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. The killing of Soleimani happened just last night. But just five months ago after months of supposed Iranian provocation. American's didn't seem to view Iran as a major concern, not even close. In a Gallop poll taken last August, just 18 percent of Americans said that they backed military force to shut down Iran's nuclear program. Seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. So, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual Americans don't enter the equation at all. They're immaterial. In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well. He vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home, which are growing.
The two things the Democratic House have done now legislatively, they've introduced a bill to -- on voting rights, to get corruption out of Washington, and they've passed bills to reopen the government. So I think they put down a marker this week that they are not here to play. They have an agenda. They're going to push it forward.
TRUMP: Good to be with, Laura.
California church draws backlash for sign: 'Bruce Jenner is still a man.'
Romney's main complaint in the piece is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true, of course. But beneath the personal slights, Romney has a policy critique of Trump. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.

However, when it comes to legalizing recreational marijuana, Democrats sing a much different tune. Many of the same folks who have been pushing for healthier school lunches, soda bans, lower salt content in food and calorie disclosures at restaurants suddenly don't care about legalizing a substance that has been scientifically proven to worsen our national public health crisis.
Donald Trump: We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. We do not seek regime change. However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors must end and it must end now if Americans anywhere are threatened we have all of those targets already fully identified and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary.
CARLSON: Good to see you. As we go tonight, we have a fixture on the screen. It is the birthday of our executive producer Justin Wells. We can't tell you how old he is because we don't know, but we do know he is the single best producer in all of television.
For about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class. Eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging. They're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, over policed neighborhoods, whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more.
ROBERGE: Yes. Basically any of these guns that hold a resealable clip or magazine. The way you can read the statute, it's very vague. And they are purposely doing this because they want to take away millions and millions of these guns.

And so now especially that this country's energy independent we were promised for decades once we became energy independent we wouldn't have to focus all of our energy in the Middle East.

So, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. I am going to support him. Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.
INGRAHAM: Are you still parroting the - are you still parroting the - I'm not going to waste time on this, OK? Because he, I think on three different occasions clarified what the media had said he said in Charlotte. If you guys think you're going to win a Presidential election by going back to Charlottesville, it's just not going to happen. It's not going to happen.

JASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and I hope it's sooner rather than later. But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.

WALLACE: All right. We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on Romney's criticism of President Trump. Mike Johnson sent this on FaceBook.

SANDERS: Well, they made some progress yesterday. The fact that they're sitting down at the table is some progress, in and of itself. But, they've got a long way to go. I mean, Democrats set down, the first thing that one of the individuals from the Democrats' side said in the meeting was, we're not here to make an agreement.
We didn't find out about the order until it was too late. Perhaps if we had known sooner we would've had a chance to react, and save them.
SANDERS: It's by air, it's by land and it's by sea. It's all of the above. But one thing that you're forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border, and we have to protect it.
Look, this is a time where voters are looking for a president who can lead us out of the days when it was just commonplace, or accepted to have these kinds of sexist and discriminatory attitudes. And, you know, right now, this is our chance to do something different.

What kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old.
SANDERS: Whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful and we're looking at every option we can. This is something the president takes incredibly seriously, is very passionate about, and is not going to stop until he figures out the best way to make sure we're doing everything we can to make America safer and more secure.
Members of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the Democratic Party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow, they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.
The American people deserved to hear this riveting testimony, as well as the words of those who followed. But millions of viewers were robbed of this opportunity when one of the networks, MSNBC, cut away from the press briefing right after President Trump's remarks.

Sens.

Yet, they've all also used scientific arguments to justify their positions on climate change.

Tucker Carlson: Thousands of American troops are headed to the Middle East tonight after Iran's promise to retaliate for the death of General Soleimani. But thousands of U.S. forces already deployed in Iraq may soon be ordered out of the country. A lot going on tonight. Foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is in Jordan for us tonight.

Social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.

Dana Loesch: Well, and it's -- yeah. And it's anti-science. You know, when you talk about Castro and Beto O'Rourke and Michael Bloomberg and all of these other individuals that want to circumvent our Second Amendment rights, when they talk about criminal usage, we can't have a conversation about firearms unless we are also including, Tucker, defensive gun usages. These are individuals who are in lawful possession of their firearms. And these numbers – defensive gun usage is, according to the CDC from Barack Obama when he commissioned this in 2013. It has therefore, it's -- I mean, it's been affirmed many times over, as you know, that they vastly outweigh instances of criminal possession. So, why -- my actual fear is that people find this bad, that there are good people out there who take the time to educate themselves, to learn about their firearm and to train, as we saw all those congregants at the church do just a week or so ago with Jack Harris. And then Jack Harris probably trained some of them as well. Now, that's -- people should want to be able, they should be able to defend themselves. And we should encourage and empower people to do so instead of trying to shame them or smear them or malign their character. I find that disturbing.

But let's recognize our withdrawal empowers Russia, it empowers Iran, it empowers the Syrians. And the ultimate result of it may be Iranian-supported militias on the northern border of Israel, which is anathema to our interests and our allies.
Thankfully, the president recently held a news conference with several Border Patrol officials, giving them a chance to tell the public about the critical need for physical barriers at the border.
Look, I think there are many people in the Democratic Party who are looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. But the question in my judgment is his record. I mean, I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he's apologized. I get that. I'm for forgiveness. But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.

Also in September, authorities involved in a drug-related arrest in Banks County, Georgia, said they had made the largest methamphetamine confiscation in the county's history. Deputies seized 52.2 pounds of methamphetamine worth over $2.6 million, 6.9 pounds of cocaine worth $392,000, $22,000 in cash, and 10 firearms.

I think, given what we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings and everything else, you can -- you can say what you will, but this will be the first time that there is a seat that actually changes from a liberal held seat to a conservative held seat.

ERICA KASRAIE, IRANIAN ACTIVIST: Thank you so much for having me. What I want the American people to know is that the majority of the Iranian people view Qasem Soleimani as a terrorist who has terrorized the entire region, and they don't relate to the narrative that the left has been giving.

Peter and Daniel Arbeeny have been extremely vocal about their grief and calling out the governor whenever possible. In October they staged a mock funeral of Cuomo's leadership by putting over 6,000 photocopies of his book cover in a casket outside of the Brooklyn nursing home where their father contracted coronavirus and died. In an email, they both say an apology would be the first step in helping their family start to heal, but they're not holding their breath.
TERRELL: No and here's the reason why Laura and this is why Herman will probably talk about abbreviated history. We have had economic growth for 121 months. 8 years of the Obama administration plus and you can check it out, Herman. Unemployment was 10 percent when Obama became President. It was 4.6. The only thing President Trump has given us is $1 million deficit for this year. To my knowledge, there's only 7 African-Americans I know who's going to vote for Trump. Herman Cain, Ben Carson, Kanye West, Horace Cooper, Diamond and Silk and Candace Owens. Blacks are not going to support Donald Trump this year. He won't get less - more than 8 percent.

Thanks to stories like this one, Americans are warming shockingly to socialism. Six months from now, a socialist could be the Democratic nominee for president. In a few years, this could easily be a socialist country. What would that look like? Well, of course it would be a disaster. Socialism doesn't work. It never has worked, especially not in sprawling, diverse countries like this one. Under a socialist regime, hundreds of millions of Americans would see their lives get dramatically worse, while demagogic morons like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would become vastly more powerful. That's socialism. You think America is stratified and unequal now? Wait till we get a socialist system. It will be so much worse. That's coming, by the way and at high speed. Why? Because mindless Chamber of Commerce libertarianism has allowed greed and stupidity to flourish in corporate boardrooms and unless we rein that immediately, right now, we're going to lose the system that made this country great. As of tonight, America is sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East, but the Iraqi government may soon say that they are not welcome there. So, what will happen next? We'll tell you as our coverage of the Iran crisis continues.

WALLACE: Coming up, the shutdown standoff drags on.
This is the kind of stuff that we seek to find out in a voir dire. This judge should be outraged not at anyone other than that juror. And the fact that she decided that she wouldn't recuse herself when she has already prejudged the issue by saying, this jury acted with integrity and intelligence. How do you know, judge? Have you spoken to that juror? Do you know what was posted? Do you know how she answered the question?
Perhaps most shockingly, the left has willfully ignored studies like one published in 2017 in the American Journal of Psychology showing a strong connection between marijuana and future opioid use.

So the political penalties have gotten stiffer, but the penalties for violence and mayhem have almost disappeared in a lot of cases. But again, there's no constituency for this outside of like small pockets of affluence on the coast, like normal people are not for this. They never have been for it. So how do our leaders get away with it?
RACHAEL BADE, WASHINGTON POST REPORTER: She's clearly putting a positive spin on what a lot of Democrats have privately said was a failed strategy. I mean she and Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader in the Senate set out to number one, try to get a commitment from McConnell on witnesses, firsthand witnesses to have them testify in a Senate trial. She also said she wanted to see a resolution about how the whole proceedings would be governed. She got neither of those.

And even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe.
ARROYO: It's like saying the Democrats have too white a stage. They chose to knock out these candidates, not because they were Hispanic or black, but because they weren't good enough to beat Donald Trump. That's why they're out. And Laura, to prove there is no conspiracy among Oscar voters, two of your favorite people got a best documentary nod. Barack Obama tweeted out Glad to see American Factory's Oscar nod for best documentary. It's the kind of story we don't see often enough, and it's exactly why Michelle and I hope to achieve with higher ground.

Prison today remains a Lifetime Achievement Award for persistence in criminal offending. You have to work very hard to get yourself sentenced to prison, and yet, the elites are convinced and they're trying to persuade the rest of the world that America's endemic racism is willy-nilly throwing black people in prison and throwing away the keys. That is simply not the case.
The president-elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible, said Biden spokesman T.J. Ducklo. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now.
And then it all kind of imploded, and all these diverse candidates showed that they had lack of gravitas, they were downright silly, they fell away, and now you've got this kind of old white guys' parade that's left over.
A more stringent measure that may indicate whether someone was actually high at the time of an accident suggests an increase of 84 percent.

OK. I guess you think it was OK to speak with us.
JARRETT: The prosecutors in the House had a chance to subpoena people like Bolton or Mick Mulvaney or Rudy Giuliani. They didn't do it. The one subpoena they issued, they withdrew and now all of a sudden, Nancy Pelosi is trying to engage in a quid pro quo to extort the Senate to do the job that the House was supposed to do. At the same time accusing the President of an impeachable quid pro quo. The hypocrisy and irony is, lost on no one.

WALLACE: And there's every sign that she is.
MICHAEL SHEAR, NEW YORK TIMES WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: We have still never seen what the President's legal defense of all of this is. We have seen his political defense, right? We have seen letters from Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel which are largely political arguments and we've seen the House members, the Jim Jordans of the world making largely political responses. We've never yet seen an actual legal defense.
Why is a border wall immoral?

But the biggest lie of all is when politicians like Obama claim, It's all OK. Things are getting better. We're in a recovery. Look away, there's nothing to see here.
And that's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us.
God Bless America and save us from the murder of the middle class.
That's terrible, but the numbers of accidents are so small -- 35 in all of Colorado in 2017, up from 19 in 2014 -- it's hard to draw conclusions. That deserves more study.

The president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.

PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE DIRECTOR: So Tucker, there's a four part strategy that we're pursuing in Trump time, which is to say as quickly as possible. You start with the personal protective equipment. This is the masks, and the gloves, the Tyvek suits, things like that that our public healthcare workers need. We're making sure that we can secure those supplies tomorrow. H.H.S. is going out with an RFP to secure a half a billion face masks alone.
Your mistakes cost us the lives of our family members, governor. But rest assured, we, the People will be strong in our fight for answers and accountability. And the more you try to silence us, the louder our voices will become.

WALLACE: Sir, I understand all that, I'm just asking you if he agrees to a compromise that includes other things that the Democrats want, will the Democrats give way and include money for the border barrier? Yes or no?
Mike Pompeo: President Trump's decision to remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives. There's no doubt about that. He was actively plotting in the region to take action, a big action as he described it, that would've put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. And last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.
Newsom unveiled his new health-care plan hours after a protester interrupted his swearing-in ceremony to protest the murder of police Cpl. Ronil Singh shortly after Christmas Day. The suspect in Singh's killing is an illegal immigrant with several prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that so-called sanctuary state policies, like the ones Newsom has championed, contributed to the murder by prohibiting state police from cooperating with federal immigration officials.

Take a look at this, Sarah. Federal tax refunds will be delayed. Food stamps for 38 million Americans will be cut. Millions of people will lose rental assistance payments and union leaders say hundreds of TSA workers are already off the job because they can't afford to get to work. President Trump thinks the border wall is worth all of that?
CORKE: Now, 16 days into the shutdown, it is clear that despite increased face-to-face engagement, cooler heads haven't prevailed. In fact, the president turned up the heat, warning that he would consider using a national emergency to get his wall funding if Democrats won't budge.

CORKE: Quite a week here in Washington. By the way, Chris, the White House has asked the Army Corps of Engineers to look into additional possible ways to help fund border security, including an examination of the 2018 February emergency supplemental. They say that would actually draw funds from disaster relief. We'll see if that happens -- Chris.
MNUCHIN: And China is subject to sanctions, like everybody else.
WALLACE: The president said on Friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from Sarah Sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. If he goes ahead and does that, what will House Democrats like yourself do?
ROBERGE: It's a straw argument. It's a straw argument. It's a terrible argument.
The reason that they give behind this is what's most troubling to me. So they argue that by treating HIV as a negative by criminalizing HIV, that you're stigmatizing people who are living with HIV. That's a ludicrous argument.
It should also be noted that this stage of the 2016 election, at the same stage, the GOP actually itself had a more diverse field than the Democrats have now. They had an African-American candidate, Ben Carson, joining two Latino candidates, Cruz and Rubio. But remember, they are conservative, so they don't count in the Democrats' been counting.
CICILLINE: It was a bad couple of weeks. So what does the president do? He shuts the government down and he's distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown.

More recently here in New York, with COVID-19 numbers rising at an alarming rate, the governor's office has suggested they may use the Javits Center again in case the hospitals get overwhelmed. In the spring, nursing home residents recovering from the illness were sent back to virus ravaged elder care facilities instead of being transported to the Javits Center. The governor has never been pressed on why they were not used more efficiently to help stop the wildfire of COVID-19 from killing seniors.
KASRAIE: -- when we go to school, right? In Iran, children, their pledge of allegiance is saying Death to America and Death to Israel.

Where does the pressure come and is going to be a surrender by one side to the other? Are they going to sort of lay down the instruments of war? Or is there going to be a compromise that involves something that the president ends up giving to Democrats, whether it's on DACA, the dreamers, people with temporary protected status,, whatever?

I think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing.

But what we can say, and I -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have Mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. Michael Cohen is not going to testify before Congress. I think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. And right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

It is, again, a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the American people. But it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president.
WALLACE: And does he really think he has --
HANSON: That's not the first time, Laura. Remember that during our discussions of getting out of the Iran deal, he was meeting in a shadow capacity in Paris with Iranian officials, in a way that would weaken our ability to protect our interests and get out of that flawed deal. And it's part of a larger narrative. They're really angry about the Soleimani death. But Donald Trump was very deliberate. He explained what happened. He didn't go to the White House Correspondents Dinner like Obama did and joke about predator assassination.
INGRAHAM: All right. Leo. Those are - no, those aren't facts. That's a guess or a projection. I don't want to quibble with words on a Friday night. It's a long week but I'm just teasing Herman.

Or maybe not. After months of uninspiring stump speeches and lackluster debate performances, it became pretty clear, didn't it, that most of the candidates were duds.

There was a motion to dismiss in the Clinton impeachment trial. It failed, because there were nearly a dozen felony offenses identified as abuse of power by the independent counsel Ken Starr. Here, there are no felony offenses. There are no high crimes and misdemeanors. They talked ad nauseum about extortion and bribery and in the end, they realized, there was no evidence for that. So, they conjured this wonderfully amorphous term, abuse of power. And you know I agree there ought to be and there probably will be a motion to dismiss and it should be seriously considered and voted upon.
And then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA.

Tucker Carlson: Well, if you can remember that far back during President Barack Obama's second term, Republican leaders in the Congress made a big show of opposing the Obama administration's refugee policy. Obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled Syria's civil war in the United States and at the time 25 Republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. Now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. For example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. Often, it's impossible. Some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be Syrian. That was true for sure in Europe with the refugees. Some of them might be Islamic extremists. But terrorism was not the only worry they had. America's middle class is in decline. We already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. The last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. That's just true. And anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. As with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. So, before she became the most anti-American member of Congress, Ilhan Omar was a refugee. So, at the time the Republican governors got their wish and President Trump won the 2016 election.
GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave.

And, you know, one of the reasons why I'm seeing a lot of folks from the Republican Party or formally from the Republican Party ready to cross over is that they can no longer look their children in the eye and explain the behavior of the current president of the United States.
And if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why?

WALLACE: And then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on Super Tuesday you face another centrist candidate in Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, a big story in The Washington Post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.

VICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I think they're embarrassed Laura, because it wasn't just appeasement but they had an actual tapestry of a new Middle East in which Iran would balance all of our traditional allies, Israel and the moderate Gulf regimes and we would give them cash and they would bank it, they would get more technological information in exchange for that. They would have peace for our time and John Kerry and Barack Obama could wave a paper and say, we've got an agreement.

Cuomo does get kid-glove treatment from some in the media (especially when he does quick-hit appearances on national TV) but not from the Capitol press corps reporters who cover him on a daily basis. He and his P.R. staff are generally awful to deal with, so there is little love lost. If they don't ask about the nursing home issue more often, it's probably because they know they won't get straight answers and they have dozens of other issues to cover. They might be pushing behind the scenes, and many reporters have filed FOIL requests similar to mine.

Douglas Macgregor: Look. He walked into a room at Mar-a-Lago with Senators Rubio and Graham, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor O'Brien, the Secretary of Defense Esper, and I assume Jared Kushner. You're talking about a room full of neo-cons. You're talking about the people that you've been discussing that have been urging war with Iran forever. They seem to have persuaded him that this airstrike made sense and that we should take the opportunity and do it. And publicly he's said that. I think it was probably unnecessary for the reasons that I've already outlined. This is not going to do anything for us strategically. As far as sending the message is concerned, his deputy has already taken over. The deputy has been with him since '97. This is going to stiffen resolve against us, and it's going to make any attempt to reach any arrangement with Iran virtually impossible. So, from that standpoint, I don't think it made a lot of sense. It's not necessarily helping us and what the president says he wants to achieve in the Persian Gulf with Iran.

SLOTKIN: Sure. Well, the perfect example is the government shutdown right now. We have the basis of a deal, right? Both sides are saying they care about border security. They believe in national security. Start having a real negotiation about border security, border forces, more technology at the border, fencing if we needed it in some areas. It doesn't just have to be a wall. That's the essence of a negotiation.

You took over running the department when it had become safer, it was still safer after you left and now you're seeing it move in the opposite direction.

Alan what happens - well, I was going to say it this way, the Articles of Impeachment arrive in the Senate. Couldn't and shouldn't, this goes back to my advice I'm going to give and I'm going to throw it out to you. Couldn't Mitch McConnell dispose of this travesty right off the bat? I think this even setting a precedent for these two articles of impeachment abuse the process and obstruction, obstruction for not going to court, abuse of process on these nebulous flawed grounds is ridiculous. I would either dismiss it or decide it immediately. I wouldn't entertain this nonsense at all. Thoughts.

WHITAKER: I think there's a lot of excitement, especially from the media that's going to cover this. They want fireworks. They want folks arguing. They want a lot of witnesses and a lot of controversy. Mitch McConnell doesn't want that. A lot of the senators on both sides quite frankly don't want that. They don't - you know they have a constituency back home that they need to be impressive to and to get re-elected. But fundamentally, the Democrats from the House have the burden of persuasion and if they can't prove their case in their initial 24 or so hours that they get, I don't expect that there's going to be an appetite for most senators to go further with documents or witnesses.

But first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.

AISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Aishah Hasnie. Former New York Congressman Chris Collins has been sentenced to 26 months in prison for insider trading. Collins' attorneys were looking to avoid prison time and push for probation, but earlier today a federal judge rejected their pleas. He must surrender to the Federal Bureau of Prisons on March 17th. The Republican was the first sitting member of Congress to endorse President Trump. He resigned from office in September. A mysterious and deadly virus has led to screening of airline passengers arriving at three U.S. airports from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

Now back to The Ingraham Angle.
KASRAIE: Well, with all due respect to my friends on the left, I feel like, since President Trump has been elected, he can do no right. They have blamed him for everything. And frankly, I think it is time for us to have genuine discussions and debates. And I felt like, for me, the reason I even made that video was because a lot of my friends were calling me and were like, hey, what you think about what is going on? And what is your opinion? And I just made a little video because I just wanted my friends did on my network, the Iranian and people are happy. And I was genuinely just nauseated. Why do we have sympathy for a terrorist, when I'm getting videos and pictures from people inside Iran that are happy?

What I will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. And when you look at the way that Latino voters here in Nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to Washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump. We are ready to go out and have that conversation.
COONS: I'm keeping an open mind. We had a very constructive meeting this past week. I did ask him a number of questions right along those lines and will ask them again in the public confirmation hearing.

J.D.

And we know of course that they're planting various infrastructure and economic institutions all over Africa, all over Asia, that their entire economy is growing and flourishing and yet again we risk focusing on this small region of the world that is obviously important but not nearly as important as our biggest geopolitical rival continuing to gain strength and power.

INGRAHAM: Iran's Supreme Leader -- I don't like saying that, but I said it -- today, made a rare appearance in public to call Trump a clown who can't be trusted, and praised the missile strikes against U.S. forces. The comments came two weeks after President Trump ordered that killing of Qasem Soleimani via air strike, and in the days since, of course, Democrats and the media have sworn up and down that this was ill-advised and had only united Iran. Is that really the case? We recently spoke to Iranian-American activist Erica Kasraie, whose viral video explaining how actual Iranian citizens feel has amassed nearly 5.6 million views. We started by asking her to respond to this from some in the media.

WALLACE: What you think about the report in The New York Times that in 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was a Russian agent?
FLEISCHER: It's just such a joke on its face because what they're trying to pretend is as if they're a real court of law and they're not. If the founders wanted to put this in a real court of law for a real trial, they would have done so. Then impeachment would have gone to a jury. It's not, it's going to a political body. It's gone to the House and now it's gone to the Senate. The framers intended it to be political because they want politicians who are accountable to the people to make these final decisions about whether you overthrow the people's determination from an election so stop pretending this is a court of law. If it's a court of law, why are they reading newspaper articles about it? Why are they appearing on TV? Jurors are not supposed to read articles about the cases in which they're hearing. So aren't all those Democrats who read newspaper stories biasing themselves? No, because it's not a real trial and none of us should look at it the way, we do and the Democrats should stop this silly game. No one 's buying it.
The sweeping proposal appeared destined to push California -- already one of the nation's most liberal states -- even further to the left, as progressive Democrats there won a veto-proof supermajority in the state legislature in November and control all statewide offices.

WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the president's thought about declaring a national emergency we got this tweet from Greg Engle. By declaring a national emergency, will this open the door for future -- future presidents to do the same over topics such as climate change, health care, or even gun control laws because of mass shootings? Is this really a national emergency or just fulfilling a campaign pledge?
Tucker Carlson: As well as in the campaign against ISIS. Though he was little known to the American public, Soleimani was among the most famous living figures in Iran and also among the most powerful. According to some accounts, second only to the supreme leader of that country. The Iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge against the U.S. in response to his death. Now whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. But it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs we could be engaged in a conflict, a real conflict, with Iran. From Iran's perspective we're already there. If Iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff, for example, would you consider it an act of war? You would. So, what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've seen in Syria, it was a pivot point. Neo-cons in Washington understood that immediately. Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qasem Soleimani, tweeted disgraced former national security advisor John Bolton. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran. That of course has been the neo-con objective all along. The president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that regime change and war are not the point at all.
I do not have a radical vegan agenda.
And then there is the frontrunner, Joe, what state am I in, Biden. Other than remind everyone that he was Obama's vice president for either years, what exactly is he doing to excite the Democrat base? He is a human gaffe- omatic, pulled his string and some crazy nonsense will come out.

REP. LEE ZELDIN, R-N.Y.: A lot of miscalculation.

Tucker Carlson: Thank you. For more than 100 years the Boeing company has led international aviation. To this day it's measured by dollar amounts. Boeing remains America's single largest foreign exporter. But now like so many American institutions, Boeing is in trouble. Last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. There's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. Production is being suspended. In business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. How did it happen? Well, at least part of the responsibility lies with CEO Dennis Muilenburg who has been in charge at Boeing since 2015. Fittingly, Muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. Someone in corporate America is finally being held accountable for screwing up. But before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. According to recent SEC filings, Muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. That's his punishment. And by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. Here's some context for how much money that is. A rank and file employee at Boeing might make $60,000 a year. That's a decent salary in many places. It would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced Dennis Muilenburg is getting in his severance package.

But, until then, Democrats have a policy agenda to push. They've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. And they have an election to win. If they want to beat Donald Trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. They've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. That should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.

Secondly, I travel all the time and I have people whispered in my ear, I love the Trump results. I love the Trump results. I go to a very large black church. Thirdly, look at what this President and his administration have done to directly impact black people. Criminal justice reform. Opportunity zones which impact more directly black communities and this is the only President including the last administration to basically authorize $400 million for historically black colleges and universities because they are struggling. Those are the absolute facts.

The mandate forces individuals to purchase health care coverage or pay a fee that the Supreme Court described in 2012 as a tax, rather than a penalty that would have run afoul of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Last month, though, a federal judge in Texas ruled the individual mandate no longer was a constitutional exercise of Congress' taxing power because Republicans had passed legislation eliminating the tax entirely -- a move, the judge said, that rendered the entire health-care law unworkable.

For an added bonus, they believe this stalemate with the shutdown furnishes them with another political weapon to further their impeachment agenda.

There was a very interesting moment on Friday because President Trump came out to the Rose Garden after his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on Democrats who want to impeach.

Something like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions.

TRUMP: I haven't done it yet. I may do it. If this doesn't work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.
INGRAHAM: Well, the Clinton impeachment resolution included a provision for a motion to dismiss before the witness vote took place. Now it ultimately failed but it was an important point. I mean, it's a really weird thing like if they think it's absolutely going to be defeated so what, just put it in anyway.

While the Democrats strain to squeeze the last bit of political juice from this shutdown, the president is doing the right thing. He is focused on the security and the sovereignty of the American people and their prosperity. It is a posture that is good policy, but in time it's going to prove to be good politics as well.
Internalizing all this will not be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process.

even after President Trump leaves office?
HOLMES: Well, it's -- I think this is important to know because at that point he had an obligation to do a deal with an administration that didn't see eye to eye with his conference. That is precisely the role that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi find themselves in at this particular juncture. And instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government, Nancy Pelosi's telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up -- open up the government and fund the wall. That's ridiculous.
The president is not going to give in. No wall, no deal, but he's ready to deal. And your next guest I am sure would provide funding for a barrier where it made sense if he could get something for it.

WALLACE: No, but I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you --
HARMAN: It's not a national emergency. It is fulfilling a campaign pledge. The wall is a primal scream. In your conversation with -- your very good conversation just before with Lindsey Graham and Chris Coons, both of them made clear that there are ways that Congress can make a deal. That's the right answer. And I'm going to get in a fight with Josh because I think that Mitch McConnell, his old boss, who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called Playing the Long Ball, is bunting here and he could, if he chose to, rouse a veto proof majority in the Senate to pass what the Senate passed in the last Senate, which is the collection of CRs and then just leave one, that would be the Department of Homeland Security bill, with a shorter time frame to negotiate, have Lindsay and, as far as I'm concerned, Chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on TV, which maybe Trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it.
With two children and a mortgage, child support and alimony payments, Atkinson said he has taken out a personal loan to cover two paychecks, just to be safe. But if the shutdown stretches into February, he may need to take out another.
It's sort of the same subject is racism. As racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well.

Why is Mitch McConnell completely absent from these negotiations? It's because he doesn't really know what the president will accept.

The president spoke to FOX News in Texas, on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he visited the border region to argue that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the United States.

At one point, he seemingly blamed the seniors themselves: Older people, vulnerable people, are going to die from this virus. That is going to happen. Despite whatever you do.
I don't want to speak for the president. I don't want to lock him in, but I'm confident what I just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the White House. And a lot of Democrats -- and I'm just so frustrated -- we can't get in a room and hammer it out.
WALLACE: I didn't say he didn't. I'm saying, what does he think is his authority?
SANDERS: You don't get -- it's not a quiet -- truth is truth. All right.

So Dana, you keep hearing from Democrats, this grave disappointment in their own primary electorate suggesting that they're bigots for supporting, I guess, Biden and Bernie, what do you make of that?
San Francisco, for example, facing an epidemic of shoplifting and car robberies, it has made life unbearable for many taxpayers. We've got a series on that running next week, which you won't want to miss.
The contrast should be glaring for anyone who watched. The president was really sober -- he genuinely believes that a wall is needed as part of a larger border security policy. That's what he won on. Democrats don't give a damn about securing the border. For them this is all about scoring political points and of course, 2020.

Donald Trump is a guy who, you understand, he hurts you. Even my testosterone sometimes makes me want to feel like punching him.
WALLACE: How damaging, if you don't show strong support among Latinos in Nevada, African-Americans in South Carolina -- because that question of whether or not you can get support from those minorities, of course, is the big knock on your campaign?
INGRAHAM: Victor, speaking of former Obama folks, your favorite Victor, John Kerry was on television tonight. Don't you know? Watch.

The president and his top health officials had said they would ban flavored e-cigarettes back in September because those fruity flavors appeal to teens and children.

MNUCHIN: The Europeans are adhering to our primary sanctions. Again, as we
Do you find any of those arguments persuasive?
INGRAHAM: We've got to go, but the government has no right to determine this, no right to do this. And they are not going to allow people to hold these guns.
And I generally agree that we obviously have to have compassion for people who are living with HIV, but we should not extend that compassion or understanding to criminals to go from a felony to a misdemeanor. And keep this in mind, in Washington State, particularly Western Washington, they don't prosecute misdemeanors.
TRUMP: The southern border is a dangerous, horrible disaster. We've done a great job, but you can't really do the kind of job we have to do unless you have a major powerful barrier.
On January 1st, just two days ago, you know, we signed into law and it's gone into effect where people that burglarize, that Rape 3 -- Rape third class, and a number of different crimes, violent crimes are now being considered not violent. And people aren't held when they get locked up.
I mean the administration in 2017 and 2018 has said, on the record, no terrorist organization has sent people to the United States through Mexico. So hard to declare it a national security emergency.
In other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, Muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 American households. And if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. Since 1978 CEO salaries in America's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. Meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. In 1965, CEOs in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. As recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. Today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. No wonder people are sending money to Bernie Sanders. That's what happens when you abuse the system. You discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. Now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. In Europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. Airbus CEO Tom Enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. That's a lot, but it was half as much as Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg made, and Airbus planes didn't even crash. This is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. It's dangerous for our country. Why? Well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like Dennis Muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. Attitudes are changing fast.
BARTIROMO: Eight Democrats opposed this resolution. Six are in the swing
PELOSI: Everything that he has done whether it is in Syria vis-a-vis the Turks, whether it's been in Ukraine in terms of withholding assistance as they try to fight the Russians. His denial about their role in our election then and now all roads lead to - and sometimes I wonder about Mitch McConnell to what's he - why is he an accomplice to all of that.
WALLACE: Now the president weighs declaring a national emergency and funding the wall.
What do you get the sense he's going to push first? What do you think he'll
CICILLINE: Look, I think we need to move forward on our agenda. At the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. I'm one of the people who think we have to wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.
President-elect Joe Biden released a crucial element of his new coronavirus vaccine plan Friday, as his office announced he doesn't intend to hold back doses of the authorized vaccines to ensure that people already vaccinated have a waiting dose for a second shot.
Some workers are relying on donations, including launching GoFundMe campaigns. A food pantry has opened up at a Coast Guard base in Boston.
HOLMES: Well, I mean the behavior that you described just now, Chris, is
Mitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support those goals enthusiastically.
I will also say this, Chris -- I was very concerned by President Trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that Vladimir Putin's Russia had interfered in our 2016 election. There's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of President Trump to complement President Putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from Syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for President Putin.

GOLDBERG: No, I think that's right. I think there are two issues here. One, the expletive, which she should have apologized for and just moved on. I don't think President Trump has an enormous amount of credibility condemning that kind of language or debasing discourse in any way.

Tucker Carlson: We don't know where the situation with Iran is going but we can be certain that if it breaks into a full-blown war a few things will be true. It will likely cost much more than they tell you, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars. At the end America's likely to be weaker than it was in the beginning and we know this for certain, our biggest rival will be stronger. Who's our biggest rival? It's not Iran, despite what they tell you in Washington. It is needless to say, China. Well, we're continuing to squander money and blood in Baghdad and many other capitals in that region. China is growing its economy at home even as it expands its reach throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, even the heartland of the United States. One person who's paying close attention to this, one of the few who cares, is J.D. Vance, the author, of course, of Hillbilly Elegy and we're happy to have him on our show tonight. J.D., thanks so much for coming on. I don't think anybody mourns the death of Soleimani in this country anyway, but I wonder what the Chinese think as they watch this.
The Fed claims quantitative easing is to save the economy…when the real goals are printing enough fake money to pay for $3.7 trillion in government handout bribes to Obama's voters…and making billionaire crony capitalists like Warren Buffett far richer last year, by turning Wall Street into a fixed craps game that makes bankers and CEO's filthy rich…while our children and unborn grandchildren owe back trillions in debt. By the way Obama's buddy Warren Buffett made $12.7 billion last year. How'd you do?
The best way forward for the Trump administration, then, is to do more of what it's been doing. For example, it can engage Spain, Colombia and Panama—havens for the regime's ill-gotten games—and ask them to issue stronger targeted sanctions.

This billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that Michael Bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at Woodstock when he was a teenager.

CAROLLA: What we have to do is all stop apologizing at the same time. I mean, if there's one guy with a gun, we just have pool cues and we all need to charge them at once. If we do it one by one, we'll be taken out one by one.
Making sure healthcare is affordable and accessible for every Californian, including undocumented community members whom the federal government has unjustly shut out of care, is essential to reaching that vision for our future, the organization said.

You know, I -- I think the actions that he's taken are spectacular and I can't see an area where I would disagree with him at this point.

Bernie, for all his craziness, is nevertheless authentic. In fact, this is one characteristic he shares with Trump. People who meet Trump, people who encounter Trump, say this guy is real, he's the real deal. He is what he is. Bernie is what he is. Now, I don't like what he is. I just read an article about how Bernie was thrown out of a commune because he didn't want to do any work. He wanted to talk about politics all day. The commune was all about self-sufficiency, growing your own food. So Bernie is making the case for being a bum, and there's a little bit of us that wants to do that. We don't want to get off the couch, we don't want to go to work. So there is a little bit of us that is Bernie, and I think that's the secret of Bernie's appeal.
And so, what we are saying to the president is open up the government. These other departments have nothing to do with this. Do not punish the American people by shutting down government if you don't get your way.
GAETZ: Yes, boy. He's covering stuff up faster than a cat in a litter box. I mean when you look at the Biden behavior, it is exculpatory for the President. Think about it. If the Biden's are truly corrupt, it could never be an impeachable offense to investigate corruption or to ask our friends to investigate corruption pursuant to our treaties and so, we will put that evidence on if witnesses are allowed in this trial and we will I think be able to prove dispositively that this President as he has always done was putting the interests of the American people and the American taxpayer first. These were legitimate questions.
Speaker Pelosi is not stopping there. A third provision in the rules package codifies censorship over members of the House, subjecting them to disciplinary action if they post or share information deemed to be distorted or manipulated.
There were little pictures of all the things Cuomo loved about himself. His sports car, his dog, his staff members, the boyfriend of one of his daughter's depicted hanging off a cliff and a giant nose with a cotton swab inside of it. The giant nose image was perhaps a reference to a giggly interview with his news anchor brother Chris on CNN about getting a COVID test while body bags were piling up in storage trucks outside of funeral homes in the state.

We just don't know how we're going to get there right now. So as I look at what the Senate is trying to accomplish, it is trying to keep a solid group of Republican senators together that keeps its train on the tracks. If they can't, then we could have Hunter Biden, we could have a whole host of folks be witnesses and that's when, I think the credibility of the Senate is really - could take a serious hit.
Let's take the shutdown. The wall that the president says has to be a wall or, you know, some version of a wall. You hear Nancy Pelosi say a wall is immoral. How do you compromise from that kind of rhetoric?

The only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since Comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, Mueller is appointed. This was probably immediately subsumed by Mueller -- the Mueller investigation and has been, I suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.

The larger point here, Chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between Democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. Far from it. All of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. And the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the Senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.

And then the other candidates like Elizabeth Warren and others, Beto, aspiring to be diverse, and pretending to be diverse in ways that they were not. So it was a diversity parade and a diversity charade.

He didn't say what those measures would be. But while some people are suggesting they might ask U.S. troops to leave the country, the U.S. is, in fact, sending more troops over. 4,000 to come into the region. They're coming from the Eighty Second Airborne. They're heading to Kuwait. 750 have already come into Baghdad to protect the embassy there. So, somewhat conflicting ideas at the moment. President Trump saying that he does not want war, that they killed Qasem Soleimani to avoid bloodshed because he was planning more attacks on Americans. But at the moment, suddenly heightened, heightened tensions here. Tucker?
Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post that savaged Donald Trump's character and leadership.

It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see.

The -- I spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and I think that is wrong and I don't think Democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize Democrats for acting like him. So I wish he wouldn't have used that language.
INGRAHAM: That is just a joke, but it was kind of like with Bill Clinton at the Ron Brown funeral. I'm really going back in time.
Nancy Pelosi slow-walked this. One was to find more evidence, OK, because
WALLACE: I'll let you answer about the fencing answer. But -- but, I mean, here's the problem it seems to me. If the -- if Nancy Pelosi were to say tomorrow, all right, we're going to give you the money for the wall, she'd be thrown out as speaker. Her -- her House Democratic caucus would not stand for that. If the president were to say, you know what, I give up on the wall, his political base, that 39, 40 percent would turn on him.
But I think, you know, if we've seen anything from Nancy Pelosi in the few months since Democrats retook the House, it's that she can bring those members together. And as long as Donald Trump's in the White House, I think she's going to be pretty effective. And she's shown that this week in holding the line.
But I do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment.
HARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.
We have to stop kicking the can down the road and just continuing to say, let's do it again in 30 days. Let's do it in 45 days.

Let's pay for all the problems of the rest of the world. It's crazy. You have Biden who is their front runner, who literally can't get through a sentence without stumbling.

CARLSON: No, that's -- I mean, I think that's there's not any room for improvement there at all. But the question of speech, do you think the country has become freer or less free in the last year?

But Mexico and China are also linked to the deaths of Americans. Each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of Americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. So, does that mean we get to bomb Oaxaca? Can we start assassinating generals in the People's Liberation Army? Maybe. Maybe Ben Sasse will call for that, too. He's a former consultant and a very tough character. But before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. Our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the United States richer and more secure. There are an awful lot of bad people in this world. We can't kill them all. It's not our job. Instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of American citizens. Period. That's why we have a government. So, has the killing of Soleimani done that? Maybe. No one in Washington has explained how. Instead, like Ben Sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. He clearly was. So? That's irrelevant. Meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. We're praying they don't, but they could. How do we know that? Because we've seen it before. We fought quite a number of wars around the Middle East in recent decades. We attacked Saddam Hussein twice, as you know. In the end we killed him. We invaded an occupied Afghanistan. We toppled Moammar Gaddafi in Libya.
I will re-ask that question this coming week. I have some other concerns about his views on criminal justice and civil rights. But the Mueller investigation, the rule of law, his willingness to defend the appropriate independence of the Department of Justice will be critical to my vote.

President Trump's lawyers could make a motion to dismiss or one of the senators could make a motion to dismiss and take a vote right away. Whether they decide to do that or not will be up obviously to the members of the Senate, maybe to the Chief Justice initially. But I have absolutely no doubt that the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power which every president since Adams has been accused of, by their political opponents and obstruction of Congress, which is another way of saying, the President exercised separation of powers and checks and balances in an entirely proper way should never come to actual trial.

Many Democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. It is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.
Now, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.

And we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in New York, crime did go down.

Can, in the Me Too era, the Democratic Party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?

You see his brother doing it and by the way, if you actually tracked down the schools, Laura, they ended up all failing, right? I mean it was - it was another it was another Democratic policy that ended up going into total ruins because all the schools ended up failing.

Douglas Macgregor: Well, I'm told that tomorrow the Iraqi parliament is going to vote overwhelmingly to demand the removal of our forces from Iraq. If that's the case I sincerely hope that President Trump will take advantage of it and get us out. We should've been out of Iraq and Syria a long time ago as the president pointed out, as you have reiterated. We gain nothing by staying in the country whatsoever. If these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the Iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. But if we are going to fight the Iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. As for the active killing Soleimani, I think we can say with some certainty that Iran will respond. Probably not in the way that we would. The Iranians are not like us. They do not emote. You've been listening to people emote about how much they hate Soleimani and blame the failure in Iraq on Soleimani. That's nonsense. We failed in Iraq. The generals and the politicians are responsible for the loss of American life and the squandering of our opportunities in Iraq. Soleimani simply took advantage of it and Iran now controls Iraq.
CARLSON: Trace Gallagher. Amazing story. We will get more on the coronavirus later this hour and how the Trump administration is planning to respond.

There have been many calls for an independent, bipartisan investigation into the nursing home tragedy, especially after an internal NYS Health Department study (conducted by Cuomo's own administration) dismissed the COVID-19 recovering patients as the reason for the thousands of deaths, and instead blamed staff members and visitors.

So I'm not saying it's going to be easy, and I've seen it already, you know, that sucking sound of people trying to get you to be very political, you know, salute the party instead of the country. You've got to be strong enough to push back. And that happens when you have people that you can link arms with and say, no, we're not going to do it that way, and I think we have that.
Tucker Carlson: And quickly and finally, do you think it's likely if the Iraqi parliament issues a demand that Americans leave Iraq tomorrow, that we will?
Tucker Carlson: It's just so interesting that you could look at this scenario and say of people who are literally in church on Sunday, you're the most decent, responsible people in our entire society.

Tomorrow morning, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will huddle in their weekly caucus meeting and I expect it to be more tense than a family meeting at Buckingham Palace, because you've got these Democrats and Trump districts who feel like they've been walked off the cliff. They were told that this was imminent, this was urgent, this was a clear and present danger. And then even some of the more seasoned Democrats like Adam Smith, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee where I serve telling Nancy Pelosi, let's get on with it. This is starting to look ridiculous. Let's transmit the articles.
You know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.

WALLACE: But let me just -- no, let me ask -- I don't want to go do history.
WALLACE: And how big an issue do you think this would be in a general election? Clearly they think it would be an issue. The idea that -- that you would need -- and you have reached out to social conservatives, many of whose votes you'd need -- but who might have concerns about your sexual orientation?

BRAZILE: I should be a mess right now.
So, sometimes, we will vote after their caucus, would be Wednesday or
Joining me now are two GOP Congressman Lee Zeldin, House Foreign Affairs Committee Member and Matt Gaetz, House Judiciary Committee Member. Congressman Zeldin, let's start with you. Why do you think the Democrats especially the Speaker, she's usually smarter than that? I mean I don't agree with her on a lot, but she's usually smarter than that. That was actually surprising even to me and I've been in this town longer than both of you probably combined, which is scary. But what do you think?
INGRAHAM: The field of shattered dreams, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.
So, it's not -- it's disingenuous to say that people -- presidents don't comment on criminal matters.
The government shutdown is now in week four, the longest in U.S. history, a record no one here in Washington can be proud of. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers face their first payday Friday without getting paid. Talks to reopen nine federal departments have broken down and lawmakers are out of town until tomorrow afternoon.
WALLACE: Mike Bloomberg reacting to President Trump's barrage of attacks this week, but the former New York City mayor also facing incoming about his long record in public life.
COONS: Democrats will invest in border security. I'm not going to sit here on your show and negotiate on behalf of Speaker Pelosi, but I'll tell you that what Lindsey Graham himself just told the president is a great place to start here.
CICILLINE: Well, that's a question the speaker will have to answer, but I think what she means by that is it doesn't reflect our values as a country, that America has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants, people who are fleeing violence and war.

Dana Loesch: Good to see you, Tucker. Thank you.
JARRETT: And he has every right to invoke it.
INGRAHAM: Yes, something for that. All right, New York Times' Michael Shear had this to say about the President's defense thus far.
Boudin, meanwhile, has blamed the San Francisco police union, its president, and individual officers for spreading what he called lies and misinformation. His office has received the same number of burglary cases from police for possible prosecution, despite burglaries increasing nearly 50% between 2019 and 2020, he said.

The point is across the country, in city after city, murder rates have surged dramatically compared with just five years ago. This is happening.
INGRAHAM: Gregg, here's what Romney said, Senator Romney from Utah said about having more witnesses testify.
So, what you're going to have is Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer's desire to stack the court on their Democratic watch has come back to haunt them.
WALLACE: Yes, let me just really quickly explained that when the Democrats with the majority, Majority Leader Harry Reid changed it for judicial nominees short of the Supreme Court and for cabinet appointees.
REP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: When your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won. Bullies don't win. And I said, baby, they don't, because we're going to go in there and we're going to the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).

BARTIROMO: The economy there has already weakened quite a bit. You talked
The Obama administration largely watched from the sidelines as the Venezuelan regime ran the country into the ground. It stood silent as then-Vice President Tareck Zaidan El Aissami, an alleged drug-trafficking kingpin, worked hand in glove with Los Zetas and other regional drug cartels. It was not until Trump came into office that the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on El Aissami.
MAC DONALD: Well, the activists are for it, the academia is for it. Again, the universities are the source of this narrative that says that everything about America today is defined and created by racism. And I guess, the public does not have a voice.
However, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds.

We never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, PG&E which was at one time as you remember as a Californian, the best utility in the United States. It's ossified. It's calcified. It's over regulated. It's got all these green mandates. It's got to use expensive energy production.
WALLACE: Let me just interrupt for a second, because Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Schumer have been hinting at this on Friday after the meeting, is that the Democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government?
ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: The feeling from this administration is that we are in a full-blown crisis and that they are overwhelmed by it. How do you think?
February 3. Bernie Sanders is in first place. And what this does is, this

KATRINA FOLEY, COSTA MESA MAYOR: I can't think of one situation that would lead us to believe that this is an appropriate location. Why? Why Costa Mesa? Why now?
Tucker Carlson: Sounds that way. Benjamin Hall. We're out of time tonight. We'll be back Monday. Have the best weekend.
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: If the vice president and
GRAHAM: Less damage than if we don't fix a broken immigration system. You've got to bad choices here. Continue to stalemate and see parts of the government shutdown, it will be inconvenient and it can create problems. Into the federal workforce, I'm sorry you caught up in this mess. But the real damage is people coming across the border, selling drugs, killing Americans, that needs to come to an end. So, the real damage is a broken border compared to a partial shutdown.
This is a reversal of what the Trump administration has been doing.

Colorado's crime rate did rise a bit. But many things influence crime rates. Washington state's violent crime rate rose a little but slightly less than the national average.
MILLS: Right. So I think the President of the United States' convictions on this matter are sincere, but I think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with.

It doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when I was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now.
CARLSON: Last week on the show, we covered the sentencing of Roger Stone who is perhaps the most undeserving of all the casualties of the Russia collusion hysteria.

But it's my suspicion that that will ultimately lead to the least suspenseful trial in all of trials because we all know that the result will be the President being exonerated because he did nothing wrong in his call with President Zelensky.
I've asked him those questions, and I'm very comfortable with those answers. So, I think you'd be a great attorney general, great job by the president to pick Mr. Barr. I see no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but that would be up to Mr. Mueller to make his report to attorney general and he soon will I hope.
WALLACE: How serious is he about that? Has the White House drafted an emergency order? A resolution that he could, that he could -- that he could announce tomorrow -- we're going to declare a national emergency; we're going to build the wall. Has he set a deadline for when he's going to end talks and simply say, I'm going to go off on my own and do it? And is he really prepared --

INGRAHAM: California, we have to walk across the hypodermic needles and the homeless crisis to actually find people to interview, Leo, and you know that is the case. All right, so I wouldn't hold out California as a shining beacon of what is sane these days. I love California, it is a beautiful state, but they are ruining --

CAIN: Allow me to answer the question, Leo, without you interrupting me.
COONS: I have talked with Republican colleagues about finding a way that we have a clearer process for welcoming and vetting and making part of the confirmation process any such allegations so they don't arise at the last moment. I think there was a great deal of consternation over the timing of those allegations and then how seriously they were taken and investigated - - or not.
Congressman Chaffetz, you were -- are a former congressman from Utah. What do you make of -- of Mitt Romney, before he is even sworn in, having an op- ed in The Washington Post that -- that basically says this president is living -- not living up to his responsibilities as president, certainly in the image department, and what's the reaction been back home?
NANCY MESSONNIER, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL CENTER FOR IMMUNIZATION AND RESPIRATORY DISEASES, C.D.C.: ... include dividing students into smaller groups or in a severe pandemic, closing schools and using internet based tele-schooling to continue education.
CARLSON: A major coronavirus outbreak in this country is now inevitable. That's the finding of the C.D.C. today. So how do we respond? How is the Trump administration working to fight this? A member -- a key member of administration joins us to answer that question after the break.
INGRAHAM: I'm great. Isn't the economy good enough across all demographics considerations to swing black voters, at least some to President Trump?
Having said all that, I'm going to ask the FBI director, was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the Russians? I find it astonishing and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the FBI, McCabe and that crowd. I don't trust them as far as I throw them.
When I look back on our own family experience it comes down to this: The dangerous people (those who were recovering from COVID-19) were forced into nursing homes, putting others in extreme danger. And people that could make a difference in the residents' physical and emotional well-being (the family members) still, as of this date, are not being allowed into those facilities.
That's why I said, and I'll say it again, that it's a shame that the hard

SANDERS: We have to look at it across the board.
WALLACE: Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk to you.
It's so humiliating that I personally couldn't do it.
What's remarkable is how the rest of us responded to it. We didn't question why Sandberg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandberg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It is not. It is bondage. Republicans should say so.
Tedros delivered a speech praising Zimbabwe as, A country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the center of its policies to provide healthcare to all. Now, that's lunatic. But bad politics aside, Tedros has endangered human lives, which is a weird resume point for a man running a World Health Organization.

CARLSON: So months after Jeffrey Epstein's death, however, that occurred, his alleged fixer is still free. Where is she? New reports tonight about where and who is protecting her? Remarkable story. Trace Gallagher fills us in after the break.
We were all confused. And scared. But none of us knew the tragedy was yet to unfold.
She is a judge who should be outraged that a foreperson on a jury that convicted a man on seven counts may have lied to her, may have exhibited such jury bias that it would demand a new trial. But no, she is mad at you. She is mad at the President. She wants to have a hearing on whether or not there was jury bias in private because she doesn't want anyone intimidating the jury.
WALLACE: But is it fair game for President Trump when he's made sexist comments too?
So, this was the beginning of a conversation that still has I think a lot left to be worked out. They're going to meet again later this afternoon, and hopefully, they'll continue to make progress and continue to move the ball down the field.

Just after 3 p.m., as the victims were still telling their stories, CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin interrupted the coverage, The Washington Examiner reported at the time. At almost the same time on MSNBC, anchor Chris Jansing broke into the live coverage. 'Of course their stories are indeed tragic,' she said, before moving on to a segment that disputed Trump's assertion that there is widespread crime committed by illegal immigrants.
WALLACE: Let me ask about women, because there's a long story in The Washington Post today.
CARLSON: I can't resist pointing out that at the very moment when we're literally letting arsonists go free, Roger Stone is facing life in prison for what? It's not even clear.
Former presidential favorite Joe Biden still hasn't won anything in the race so far, but he is counting on South Carolina to be his firewall.
WALLACE: All right. Let's talk about the merits of a border wall. Here's what new Speaker Nancy Pelosi says.
GRAHAM: The plan is to do a deal. He is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status.
You are dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor.

WILLIAMS: He said Mexico will pay for this this.
TERRELL: Laura, can I just make one point?
ARROYO: The bias in Hollywood is not this. The bias in Hollywood is ideological, and it's why Passion of the Christ and Eddie Murphy were not nominated and probably won't be, too politically incorrect. And if you had to nominate someone for an Oscar, Laura, I would choose Prince Harry. Over the last few weeks and that bombshell announcement that Harry and Meghan Markle were planning to withdraw from their royal duties, now video has emerged from July at a movie premiere, where Harry is seen pitching his wife to Disney CEO Bob Iger for best support performance supporting your wife so she can support you. Here is Prince Harry.

WALLACE: OK, I want to move on just because I've got so many other questions to ask you.
Joining us now, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.
JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: I am focused now on us
Will Mr. Trump, going forward, respect Barr's request for him to stop commenting on current cases, whether it's -- whether it's in terms of on the air, you know, public statements, or tweets?

Meanwhile, in China, an aggressively nationalist country that if nothing else, definitely doesn't hate itself, authorities acted immediately and with force.
SANDERS: Look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. But you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? He never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to Officer Singh of California's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. This shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.
GREEN: I think what we, as a class, the freshman class, brings, particularly the congresswoman and I, is, you know, a life of service to the country. You know, she's prior military, I'm prior military and we want solutions. And we're just sick and tired of it not happening. And our constituents sent us here to get it done. So we're -- we're rolling up our sleeves and going to -- going to get it done.
SCHWEDHELM: I think the U.S. has done a nice job in working through preparedness in the last year, but long ways to go. There's -- I'll go ahead.

WALLACE: Jonah, this clearly, in the very first week that the House Democrats took over and had done a lot of very careful things in terms of messaging, stepped on their message, the fact that we're talking about it, the fact that cable news has feasted on this.

And this is with the Chinese Communist Party trying to put their thumb on
I think the thing about Joe Biden is that a lot of people will give him the benefit of the doubt and they will think, well, Joe means well. Okay, like, he doesn't really -- he doesn't want us to be without jobs. He cares about us -- like, he has that.
TRUMP: It was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg, and it was terminated by a current mayor. But stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.
Tucker Carlson: Threats in the region. If you don't live in Washington, here's the translation. That would be in hostile middle eastern countries, places where American troops would never be in the first place were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like Max Boot [spelled phonetically] and John Bolton. But nevermind. No one in Washington is in the mood for big picture questions right now. Questions, the obvious ones, like is Iran really the greatest threat we face and who's actually benefiting from this and why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit? By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan 19 years -- sad years later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran? And so on. Nobody is thinking like that right now. Instead, chest beaters like Senator Ben Sass of Nebraska are making the usual war-like noises, the ones they always make. This is very simple, Ben Sasse wrote in a statement last night, General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans, which is essentially true. Soleimani was certainly a bad guy but does that make killing him very simple? It does not. Nothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever very simple and any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. Yes, Soleimani was linked to the deaths of Americans. Nobody mourns his passing.
CARLSON: It might happen. Washington is lobbying for Turkey. If that's disqualifying, you've got nowhere to have lunch with as you know.

None of that was true, but saying it was less painful than rethinking the failed theology of globalism, so they went with it.
CONWAY: The president thinks that Andy McCabe should have been punished because he lied and he lied several times to the investigators and many people feel the same way.
MULVANEY: Yes, I think the 25th Amendment is a very clumsy tool. We've
The U.S. Justice Department announced in October that it is investigating whether New York is undercounting coronavirus deaths among nursing home residents, and demanded detailed data from hundreds of private facilities. But as of this report, a senior Justice Department official confirmed to me that New York state has failed to provide ANY data as of their October request.

ELLEITHEE: The president will -- will -- will cave and Democrats will actually find a way to help him cave a little bit less painfully is -- is what's going to be really interesting.
Jim Antle: Right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. And so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the Republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in Afghanistan and Syria, and the vast majority of Republican senators voted to rebuke him. And in the case of Syria, we're talking about a war that Congress never voted to authorize in the first place. Well, here we are in Iraq, and we have most Republican senators saying that they don't want Congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against Iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. I think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of Cold War 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, Republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing Democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped Trump win in 2016.
WALLACE: It has to be the kind of compromise.
I've been saying this all week and I'm going to keep saying it. Joining me now is Ari Fleischer, former White House Press Secretary, Fox news contributor. Also with me is Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch. Ari, looking at Trump's legal team, what's your take away?
PERINO: I think that it's showing that you have some -- I mean, think about Bill Clinton, right? I feel your pain. He didn't really, right?
CAIN: The answer is, they don't want to put up with the ostracism -- being ostracized by people who think that all blacks should vote Democrat.

MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.

And as Chris Coons pointed out to you this morning, Chris, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans had a unanimous support, Republicans and Democrats, for a bill that would have opened the government, kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward. It's the president who has made it a point to say, I'm shutting down this government over the wall.

Our former Secretary of State just siding with Iran.
COONS: Well, that was a concerning, even alarming report and it suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion. I'm grateful for the partnership of Senator Graham, now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with Senators Tillis and Booker to protect the Mueller investigation, and I think that report by The New York Times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place.

WALLACE: So, let's -- you're exactly right. I -- you have voted for a border barrier in the past and I've been looking at your records, so let's put it up on the screen. In 2013, as part of comprehensive immigration reform, you supported $46 billion for border security, including 350 miles of new fencing. In 2018, last year, you and most Senate Democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.
WALLACE: I mean, in fairness, we heard Congressman Cicilline today say exactly that, and Jerry Nadler, who is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which is where this issue of impeachment, if it's going to come up, would come up, said the same thing this week.

HOLMES: He basically played a role for eight years as minority leader in the Senate were Democrats control the Senate.
J.D. Vance: Well, Tucker, I'll give you a cynical answer and then a less cynical answer. I mean, the less cynical answer is basically that a lot of people just aren't very good and very smart at what they do and honestly I actually hope that's the answer because the more cynical answer is that as our country has successfully bungled or sorry successively bungled middle eastern wars and allowed China to rise, there is of course a group of people who've gotten very wealthy off of China's growing power and that's the financial elites who actually run the country who donate to the think tanks of course that produce the policy papers that so many of our politicians rely on and so I do think that one way of recognizing that there's been a massive failure here is that the people who have not been in service of the American national interests are still collecting a paycheck and the people who have gotten it right are still largely on the fringes and I think that's fundamentally a story of incentives and a story of who donors are benefiting from and who donors are paying to effectively issue what is propaganda.

But it seems to me that if - - if -- if airports start essentially shutting down and rip people out and the rest of the country start to feel the bite, that is where I think the pressure really starts to build. That moves markets. That's going to cause congressman to start buckling.
GUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.

The answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. And yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.
I don't think Mitt Romney's going to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. That's just my instinct. I do think John Kasich might. I think Jeff Flake might. And a lot will depend on the Mueller report. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and once we get that, I think you'll see some Republicans make some decisions about that primary.
TRUMP: I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written.

CICILLINE: I think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders. We have appropriated $1.7 billion over the last two years for border security. The department has spent less than 6 percent. But we are prepared to do more because we need to do more, but we want to do it in a way that's effective.
But I think the legislative path is just about shut off because Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House, said, even if you open up the government, I will give you $1 for the wall. As long as that's the case, we are never going to get a legislative package no matter what the Senate does.
your predecessor as White House chief of staff says he gave this advice to
J.D. Vance: Well, I think for a couple of reasons. One, we have an entire generation of American intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the Middle East was just the most important region of the world. And so, one way of thinking about American policy really for the past 20 years, the George W. Bush administration, of course the Barack Obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. We basically had one new war per term, Iraq, and then -- excuse me, Afghanistan, then Iraq, Lebanon and Syria during the Obama terms and that's obviously terrible and I think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for America's national interest but viewed from the Chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. Of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for America's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that China was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. I think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the American foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.
SANDERS: -- they can try to do harm to Americans, then he is not going to be the president that he knows himself to be, and he has shown himself to be over the last two years.
For example, disgraced National Security adviser, John Bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with Iran and tonight, Bolton may be finally getting his wish. Should you be happy about that? That's the question.
And what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file FBI men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including Andy McCabe, who are at the top levels of the FBI in 2016 trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president.

Well, Eric Trump is here to react to that and how long can Democrats deny the advancement for Black America under Trump and just how much of the vote of African-Americans could Trump capture? Herman Cain and Leo Terrell, oh my goodness, I cannot wait for this. They're going to debate this new Wall Street journal piece, it's making a lot of waves and it's Friday so you know Raymond Roy is here. We got the Oscars. Apparently they're too white and to male. And also plus hypocrisy of course out completely out of control plus Prince Harry's embarrassing groveling to the Disney boss, all caught on tape, we'll get all of that but first. As the Senate jockeys over the rules for next week's impeachment trial, the President today announced his defense team and it's stacked with some serious legal minds.
WHITAKER: This is the first time that a President's been impeached where there's underlying crime and on a purely partisan vote. So we don't have any elements of those crimes with which we can compare the facts that were you know, sort of developed in the House and this is why this is a very troubling time in American history, if you take a step back and understand, we've entered a new era of partisan impeachments which is not good for our Republic. And so I hope that the senators understand that and that they cannot turn this into a very partisan circus which is what we saw in the House.
Here we have a president who doesn't really I think even know about it, and flouts it through social media, broadcasting his desire to see this or that person benefited by justice, somebody else should go to jail, and that, as Bill Barr said is totally threatening to that norm.
BUTTIGIEG: And if we light up this country, then everyone can make sure this country will now shine as a beacon around the world once more.
Banning drugs doesn't stop teens or adults from using them. Anyone who wants the stuff knows how to get it. One survey found that teens said it's easier to buy weed than alcohol. Alcohol is rarely sold in schools, but banning marijuana creates fat profits that inspire dealers to recruit students to sell to their peers.

INGRAHAM: But what about the progressive? As we've reported this week, an all-out war has broken out between radical hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and socialist Bernie Sanders and there's fact, it's likely going to get nastier. Vermont's former governor, Peter Shumlin telling Politico, Bernie and his team feel they're holier than the rest. In the end they'll play dirty. Even if he considers you a friend like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie will come first. Joining me now, Eric Trump, executive VP of the Trump organization. Eric, great to see you tonight. No wonder the Democrats are pulling out all the stops to remove your father from office given what's happening in this top tier of candidates. It's wild - I've got to say this, it is wild watching this.

What caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't even want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner-city dysfunction and it made sense: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what conservatives called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.

I want to put up some statistics. In November of 2017, a year plus ago, the border patrol apprehended 7,000 family units at our southwest border. This past November, two months ago, they caught 25,000 family units coming across.
So I don't think the president has the authority to do that, and I hope you will continue to try to work with Congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first. This -- the government will reopen when the Republicans in the Senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn't be shutting down the government if they don't get their way.

Bill Hammond is the senior fellow for health policy at Empire Center, an independent, nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank located in Albany. Hammond has been one of our biggest allies in trying to find out the total number of seniors that died having contracted COVID in nursing homes.

When the state rejected the appeal, the Empire Center responded by suing for the information.

But this whole situation with legacy media and many other individuals looking down their noses at good people who want to be able to protect themselves. I mean, for crying out loud, let's look at Maryland, for example. Maryland, back in just a couple of years ago, when they passed their National Firearms Act, I think this is 2013, 2014. It was all with the promise that, look, law enforcement is going to take care of you. The state is going to protect you. You don't need your firearms to protect yourselves. And then look what happened. Baltimore's homicide rate, their violent crime rate spiked by 300 percent. It's insane. People want to be able to defend themselves because they know that the state, even though the state promises them that they're going to do this, they never make good on it. In fact, some of the biggest errors that we have seen with previous mass casualty incidents had been because people in government have dropped the ball.

Johnny Joey Jones: Well, I think it's impossible to separate the emotional appeal of killing someone who deserved to die and the overall strategic kind of cautionary tale of what are we going to do next? You know, I wrote for FoxNews.com today that the tactical decision to send troops into Iraq that I was a part of, the troop surge got the al-Qaida out of Al Anbar, but would we do next? What was the strategic goal after that? Same thing, I was a part of a troop surge in Afghanistan when I lost my legs. We got the Taliban out of the poppy fields, away from the opium trade, but what did we do the next day? And that was the problem, and I think a lot of this is that politicians that hold each other accountable, they throw each other under the bus. So, when we change presidents, sometimes we change policy for that purpose -- so that we can be a contrast, not necessarily more right or more wrong. And so, it's not so much that I take issue or really have an opinion over killing this guy yesterday. It's what are we doing next? What is the strategy, not the tactical, what did in this one operation, but what's the overall point here?

Last week, the president praised the Justice Department for changing the way it's handling the case against former Trump associate Roger Stone.

All this is going to come back to haunt them one day.

And if that is the case, you ought to wonder down to the speaker's office and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office and give them a piece of your mind.
And then starting 2020, starting an election year, she's coming out of the gate with a miscalculation with regard to these articles of impeachment and winning extra-long in order to send them over. A lot of miscalculations done by. I think it's going to be paid at the polls in November. And what she should be doing if she was smart, because she has all these Democrats in districts that Donald Trump won. She should be talking about delivering them wins to go back to their district, but instead all those Trump voters have to be fuming at these Democrats who represent, because they didn't send them to Washington to impeach the President--

He's not done a lot of you know, sexy trial work so they're trying to like I guess, raise expectations, lower expectations for him. But I love the fact and you know, full disclosure, he's a close friend of mine so I know he's going to be fantastic but I love the fact that he's kind of an enigma to them because he's not someone who seeks the limelight. Well, any basic research into his background, he's an experienced attorney. My guess is he can handle politicians in the Senate and that process. You can see though why Nancy Pelosi didn't want the Senate trial to happen and that's why she obstructed it because now you're going to have all these politicians that they have pointed as impeachment managers come over and have to deal with real lawyers. I fear we're going to have a Kavanaugh type situation because in the ordinary course, the President's going to be vindicated in short order so they're going to think of ways to subvert that. This is why your motion for dismissal is a good idea. This is why they should knock Schiff out because he's conflicted.

And the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do American citizens harm.
GRAHAM: Well, what President Obama did, he didn't declare a national emergency about the DACA recipients. He took his power to pardon an individual or a smaller group and applied it to 1.8 million people. Ever president -- not every, a lot of presidents have declared emergencies. After 9/11, we did and they have taken money and powers to deal with a national emergency.
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Democratic field is obviously big. It's more diverse than many other years.
There are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago.

In a funding request to the Senate Appropriations Committee this week,he asks for items important to Democrats, including, $800 million for humanitarian needs at the border, such as medical support and additional facilities to house migrants - which, frankly, a lot of Americans probably think would be better spent on inner-city youth and on our veterans.
I think it was AOC's Chief of Staff who said the New Green Deal was really not about climate change, but changing the American economy along socialist lines. This had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, Tucker.

Police say Troy McAlister, 45, was intoxicated when he ran a red light in a stolen car, killing Elizabeth Platt, 60, and Hanako Abe, 27. The San Francisco police officers union says a plea agreement for a robbery set McAlister free on parole in April, and that Boudin's office failed to prosecute McAlister's multiple arrests in the aftermath, including one Dec. 20 for alleged car theft.

INGRAHAM: The uphill battle that these Democrats face is November isn't because they are not diverse enough. It's because they are not pragmatic enough. Free health care, free college, free preschool, frozen fossil fuel industry, open borders, higher taxes -- it is not going to grow the economy. It's not going to grow your 401(k), your bank account, or whatever, as Jill Biden would say. Empowering governments means taking away power from you. More power for the government means less freedom for you. By the way, it's the same government that thinks wasting millions on dead- end investigations and impeachment is more important than infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices.

The evidence is clear: The mainstream media don't want the American people to know the truth about the ongoing tragedy at the border, so they fill the airwaves with misinformation and then accuse President Trump and his supporters of lying when they state the facts that liberal journalists are so desperate to keep under wraps.
And this is what happens when you change the rules. This has come back to bite them. I predicted it would, and we'll see.

I personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. What I think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the Trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. The humanitarian crisis I think may have been what she was referring to.
The whole Cuomo family was suddenly in our lives.

Essential government workers, like TSA agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. While furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if Congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.

Tucker Carlson: So, it turns out disarming you is just one part of the plan to remake your life. Imagine a place where the streets are lined with syringes and human feces, where the police no longer have power and criminals operate with impunity. Where there are literally more drug addicts living on the streets than there are high school students enrolled. There's no need to imagine a place like that. Unfortunately, it already exists. It's called San Francisco. For a century, San Francisco was the crown jewel of the West Coast, the single prettiest place in America's richest state, our Cape Town. Well, today it's become a kind of hellhole that only left-wing leadership could create. And make no mistake, activists want to make certain that your town becomes San Francisco. So, on Monday, this coming at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we're debuting an exclusive five-part investigation into what exactly has happened to San Francisco, into its collapse. We sent a crew out there for a week. The footage and interviews, they came on with our shocking. Here's a preview. Viewer discretion is advised.

Sure enough, lower and middle-class workers have seen significant wage increases under this administration.

But it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face. I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.
WALLACE: Running workshops for tens of thousands of students.
Dana Loesch: No, I agree with you, Tucker. And thanks for having me. I find it horrifying that anyone at USA Today would actually find it horrifying to save lives, to defend innocent people, because that's exactly what happened. I was also, and the reason to remind everyone that we have this video to go by, is because sadly, the church was live streaming their service that Sunday morning, as they always do, and it ultimately was captured. But you see in that video, Tucker, there are about five other law-abiding individuals who also draw their weapons, which is probably what would happen at my church. And I'm one of the law-abiding people who carry in my church, and we are encouraged to do so. But five other people also drew their lawfully carried, lawfully owned firearms, and they held. They watched and waited and took in everything that was happening before then, which indicates a level of training and a skillset that shouldn't horrify people. In fact, it should encourage individuals, because we were always told that if there is more than one firearm present in an area such as this, that there's a mass casualty incident or someone armed comes in to do murderous intent, that it would turn into the Wild West. Well, it didn't. It took Jack Harris one shot and six seconds to neutralize this threat. God bless them and God bless Texas.

And we're quoting now, The idealization of individual homeownership created the scorching landscapes we face today. Individual homeownership should be seriously questioned.
But then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. And Nancy Pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides Republicans, that peels off Republicans. And the one thing that will keep Republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the Mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. If it just becomes -- if the Democratic Party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the Republican Party, which I think is a real concern, of just the anti-Trump party, than that will unify the Republicans.

But Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation.

A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up in no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.

LEE SMITH, AUTHOR, PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT: Qassem Soleimani was in many ways the cornerstone of the nuclear agreement that they made in July 2015. The Obama administration made that deal not with the imaginary moderates, but with the hardliners and no one was a harder man in that regime than Qassem Soleimani. He really was the cornerstone of the deal in many ways.
Habitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught. With no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend.
WALLACE: Guy, first of all, your reaction to Donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? Do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general?

The order stated that if a hospital determined a patient who needed nursing home care was medically stable, the home had to accept them, even if they had been treated for COVID-19. Nursing homes could not test incoming residents to see if they were newly infected or perhaps still contagious.

COONS: Well, frankly, I think the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end. What made the confirmation hearings of Justice Kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing.

I know, Bolton is a bugbear for you. But in some ways, Bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious. He actually was a bit of a problem for the Iran Hawk Crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like Robert C. O'Brien, Bolton's successor might actually be more effective at Trojan horsing, what I think would be a tragedy in the Middle East.
They did a great job. I just wish they had the leadership at the top that
Jim Antle: -- campaigned on the idea that we were going to shrink our footprint in the Middle East. I think that's what he'd like to do. I think he's trying to balance the fact that he would like to do that with the desire to be tough. The desire to protect American personnel that are still in the region, but he has a lot of advisers who are committed to the things that he ran against. He has a lot of George W. Bush retreads who are giving him advice on what to do with Iraq and with Iran, and the danger is that once you've done some of these things, once you've committed to some of these moves, you're going to draw more troops in rather than drawing down, as I think the president would prefer to do -- that there is no easy exit strategy; that there is no easy way out. So, the hope is that this strike is going to cripple Iran's capacity to be able to threaten our people. We can move on, and if Iraq does, in fact, decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, as was always likely once we put a Shiite government in charge of Iraq, that they were going to be friendlier to Iran than Washington was ever going to prefer, that we use that as a reason to get out, having accomplished everything that we're going to accomplish there.

Tucker Carlson: I don't understand how this works. Well, so people who hate Christianity are demanding that in the name of Christianity Christian governors admit refugees, but the governors aren't actually housing any of the refugees in their own homes or paying any of their own money so how is it Christian virtue to take in other people's money by force and give it away?

ELLEITHEE: And I do think it is premature. I think most members of House Democratic leadership agree with that. Most members of House Democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way Tom Steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. There may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and Bob Mueller will let everyone know when that time is.

In New Hampshire, the so-called moderate candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote of voters in that state, but -- which was double what Bernie Sanders got, but he won in New Hampshire because he had that left lane, the more liberal lane, all to himself while the so-called more moderate lane was kind of clogged up by you and -- and Biden and Klobuchar, all of whom split up the votes.

Donald Trump thought the Iraq war was a mistake, but the people end up doing some of the same mistakes, repeating some of the same mistakes that they campaigned against.

Methamphetamine is still big business in Minnesota and Drug Trafficking Organizations bring meth to major metropolitan hubs like Chicago and Minneapolis then break down the product for mid-level dealers, said Faribault Police Chief and Violent Crime Coordinating Council Chair Andy Bohlen was quoted as saying. Eventually, the drug continues to spread and ends up in all communities across the state.
FLEISCHER: You know, what gave me so much doubt about watching him in those interviews that he was giving is, when people start to say, everyone's in on it. You know he had to be aware of it. Everyone's aware of it and they offer no specifics. So he says the Vice President was in on it, the Attorney General knew everything about it, without ever saying, in a meeting on such and so date at such and so place, the Vice President was informed by such and so. Total lack of specificity so it's one of these sweeping generalizations statements that candidates make. Witnesses don't because he didn't witness the specifics. He has nothing specific to provide and that maybe just shrug my shoulders and say this is a guy who curries up to anybody and everybody, he tells anybody and everybody what they want to hear. He did it with Rudy Giuliani and now he's doing that with the Democrats and with their favorite TV shows so I don't think he'll advance the ball one bit.

The problem, Tucker that we have now is if somebody has symptoms, they have to go to a hospital, take a sample, send it to a lab and wait 48 hours for that. What we're trying to do is adapt existing handheld devices to the coronavirus so that workers out in the field can get instant results.

HOLMES: Well, I think if you cut away from the sort of conspiracy and all the invective that this New York Times article actually injects into our public discourse, what we've learned here is the mind-set of the FBI at the time. We learned nothing about the fact pattern that the president of the United States engaged in. In fact, we've known all of this for months.

turn their attention for the next few days on how they can fight back
INGRAHAM: All right, gentlemen, thanks so much. Great to see you both tonight. So what's next? What's going to happen next week? Well, first, senators are going to vote on Tuesday on the resolution we've been discussing this week, almost every night and that resolution will govern the rules of the Senate trial. So set out length of questioning, rebuttal and so forth and now at that point, senators will be able to vote on whether individual witnesses will be called. There'll be a debate that happens and that's when things get very dicey. So if Democrats get their way, they'll do everything in their power to exploit these witness votes.
The tech giants so eager to assert control over what is allowed to be shared don't have a great track record when it comes to deciding what information is accurate.

TRUMP: Listen, my father's a sponge. He watches everything. I mean his ability to retain information is incredible. It's the best I've ever seen so yes of course, he's going to be watching, I'm sure parts of it. But listen, these people are crazy. If you look at Pelosi, right? I mean Pelosi, I keep on saying is handing him the win. We're raising tremendous amounts of money. I was in Ohio all day, yesterday. The amount of people that are coming forward, saying, listen, these people do not represent us anymore. We can't relate to these people and you know people see it for what it is. My father's signing trade deals with China. He's signing USMCA. He's signing all these great deals. We've got the greatest economy in the history of the world. We've got the lowest unemployment that we've ever had. You know, 401Ks are through the roof. I can go on and on and on and she's sitting behind a desk trying to impeach him because she knows that none of the candidates that we were just talking about before, can actually beat him, right? So this is their 'Hail Mary.' They're trying to throw a ball up. They know they're probably going to fumble it, at the end of the day. They know they're not going to win because you know no one on that stage actually has any sparkle. They don't have any twinkle in their eyes. They don't have any charisma.
WALLACE: Well, let me follow up on that because Kellyanne Conway was, I think, trolling Democrats and saying, boy, this part that talks about all of these principles in the Me Too era, are they going to nominate somebody like Michael Bloomberg with his record of things he's done, for instance, towards women in the workplace, just because they think he can beat Donald Trump? What would that say about what the Democratic Party really stands for?
ROVE: WE can stay stuck in this and we can argue about Nancy Pelosi saying it's an immoral wall, which she voted for the wall last year and did not declare when -- when Barack Obama wrote -- built 133 miles of wall that that was immoral.
Congressman Chaffetz, there was an interesting development in the last couple of days.

But there is bad news: The driving death rate increased in Colorado and Washington after legalization. But the data isn't clear -- driving deaths are up even more in some neighboring states like Idaho, where weed is still banned.
Look, the American people are not going to be fooled by anybody from the Trump White House when it comes to these issues. So I'll leave it to my competitors in this race to speak for themselves, but one thing we can all agree on is that we can do a lot better than this president.
At the end of the day, though, Democrats have said over and over again that they support border security, that they support protecting American citizens -- now, it's time to fulfill some of those statements that they've made -- work with the president, let's get this done; let's open the government back up.

But frankly, diversity is the least of the Democrats' worries, if you ask me. Their top three candidates, those old white folks, they are struggling to find a coherent message, and at this point are just at each other's throats. The Sanders campaign is reportedly telling volunteers manning the phone backs or knocking on doors to frame Warren as the candidate of the elites. When she heard this, Warren went on the warpath.

Under our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate as someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of our rich people do.

DERSHOWITZ: Right. Then it goes to court and the courts will decide.
INGRAHAM: I just can't. Sometimes, though, through all of that, sometimes voters probably just forget which Biden is actually running.
Secondly, there are a lot of your GOP colleagues who say that would be a terrible precedent because someday, there's going to be a Democratic president and they're going to say, well, you know what, it's a national emergency, so let's fund climate change.

We want to find out exactly how much he personally profited Hunter Biden which I don't think anyone really knows but it's obviously a lot of money. Joe Biden's brother has been caught now, you've referenced in passing, trying to profit off of his family name, just like old Hunter. ABC news reporting, Frank Biden touted his famous last name and prominent connections in Washington to help land a series of charter contracts from local officials in Florida to open charter schools, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars over a five-year period. They brought him in for his name one critic said. Well, Eric you made all the money and then your family went into politics, not you but these folks are doing it the other way around. They had no money. They went into politics and then their family members cashed in.

WALLACE: Well, of course, the question is -- is the wall the best way to do it? And I'm going to ask you about that in a minute.
WALLACE: So why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?
And we'll find out what House Democrats hope to accomplish from congressional leader David Cicilline.
WALLACE: That's 16 days from now. Some White House officials are talking about this extending into February.
Negotiations to end the shutdown stalled on Thursday, as Trump, during his visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, argued a barrier made of steel would deter human trafficking and other violent crimes.
SHUTDOWN REALITY SETS IN: Approximately 8,000 federal workers on Friday will face their first payday without a paycheck due to the ongoing government shutdown ... Roughly 420,000 employees have been deemed essential and are working unpaid. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. Democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the White House and across the country on Thursday to end the shutdown.
WALLACE: Now, you are telling the president, urging the president to use his executive powers to fund the wall and the president on Friday said not so fast.
CARLSON: Poor guy. We feel guilty even running that sound. But it gets even worse. Last week, Biden told you that he was arrested in South Africa for trying to see Nelson Mandela under apartheid.
They're just -- they're sent there. So the question the President, who I think rightfully ran in 2016, against the Bush legacy. The question is, does he want to re-invade Iraq?

CARLSON: Awful. So far the coverage of the attack in Monsey has focused on the rising number of violent anti-Jewish incidents in New York and across the country, as well as on Thomas's own psychiatric issues which were significant.
In New York, where Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and new Democratic majorities in the state Legislature are pushing for legalization, a recent proposal even espoused the laughable proposition that revenue generated by pot legalization could be used to fix the New York City subways.

American Crisis landed on the New York Times bestseller list in October and has lined his pockets as he continues to profit off the deaths of tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
So we'll learn soon from Mueller what's going on here.
My life didn't start out looking very hopeful, she said. I was born into a situation that set me up to fail. At the age of 8, I was introduced to drugs, and at the age of 12, I was exploited. ... I thought this was just the way that life was supposed to be until about five years ago when she was discovered by WellSpring and taken in for recovery.
But here's one forecast that caught our eyes from The Atlantic. It is titled, You're Likely to Get the Coronavirus. That piece quotes extensively a Harvard epidemiologist. The article describes him as a cautious professional, the kind of person who carefully considers every word and then backs it with data.
And I really experienced what most people in the West have never ever experienced -- life under a totalitarian regime.

He later appeared on an Iranian news program to reassure the country that everything was under control, and then he coughed on the woman interviewing him.
In 2019 he issued an executive order allowing cities and states to opt out of refugee resettlement. That's the last time we checked in on this story. Here's the amazing part. For some reason no Republican governors are taking advantage of that. Instead, you probably didn't read this in the New York Times but 18 Republican governors have explicitly requested that more refugees be sent to their states. Have their voters demanded this? No. So what's going on here? Ned Ryun is the founder of American Majority and author of Restoring our Republic. He joins us tonight. So, Ned, I don't think there's any evidence that Republican voters in the states have been begging their Republican governors to move more refugees in. So, why are these governors literally asking the federal government to do this?
WALLACE: And -- and in 30 seconds, is Bernie Sanders a suicide pact?
The governor, it would seem, is a big fan of props. At the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, he introduced a wall of masks during a press conference while hospitals were complaining of PPE shortages. Then in May, his giant Q-Tip comedy routine with brother Chris began on cable news. The governor also had someone make a bizarre giant plastic COVID mountain to go with his poster demonstrating at a press conference how he had flattened the curve of coronavirus cases in New York.
INGRAHAM: The most important thing about this, and we are going to get to Mark in a second, the most important thing people have to understand, an assault style weapon -- people hear that and they think, oh, my God, a machine gun. No. What is an assault-style weapon under the statute? As I'm reading the statute, it's any semiautomatic weapon that holds 10, correct, 10 in the clip, 10 or more in the clip? Most Sig Sauer, we have pictures of them, Sig Sauer 9-millimeter, Glock 9 millimeter, ARs, AK style weapon, the most popular hunting rifle in the United States is the AR-15, correct, depending on the size of the clip would be banned, those style guns?

I can't get inside his head. It's obviously a sore subject for him politically, and maybe personally, too.
