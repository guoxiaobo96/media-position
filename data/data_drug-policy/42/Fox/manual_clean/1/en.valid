trump changes rules to let tax refunds flow during shutdown - wsj: the internal revenue service will pay tax refunds even though the agency is subject to the federal government shutdown, after the trump administration reversed a longstanding policy. monday's decision removes one of the biggest potential pains for many americans from a prolonged shutdown. even if the impasse over a border wall lasts into the income tax-filing season scheduled to start jan. 28, the administration's move will let hundreds of billions of dollars flow to households. the administration is trying to make the shutdown as 'painless as possible consistent with the law,' russell vought, the acting director of the white house office of management and budget, told reporters.

wapo: as a game warden for oklahoma's department of wildlife conservation, cannon harrison is used to working on investigations… his latest bust, however, came easily — courtesy of the dating app bumble. the 24-year-old received a notification in december telling him that he had matched with a woman in his area. … harrison asked how she was doing. she had just shot a 'bigo buck,' she told him — a big old buck. 'pretty happy about it,' she wrote. at first, harrison figured it had to be a prank. his profile on the dating app doesn't mention what he does for a living. but in rural mcintosh county … plenty of people recognize him as the game warden. … the next morning, game wardens showed up at her home. … but the odds that a poacher and a game warden would end up matching on a dating app, he said, were 'probably less than winning the lottery.'

pence diminished - the atlantic: according to multiple current and former administration officials, however, as trump's friction with congress has increased, pence's clout has suffered. two sources, one close to the vice president and the other close to the president, both of whom requested anonymity in order to discuss internal conversations, affirmed … that pence was leading the trump administration's negotiations on border security. yet the fact remains that this weekend, the president gave his lead negotiator very little room to negotiate, sending pence to a meeting that trump himself said would yield nothing. this, coupled with the moments over the past month when trump has publicly undermined pence's messaging, has helped create a portrait of a vice president with diminishing influence.

[ed. note: it certainly does seem unfair that the individuals responsible for the shutdown are not among those affected by the shutdown itself. shutdowns were introduced to our budgeting process as a bipartisan penalty for intransigence. nobody is supposed to want a shutdown. but as our government has lost the capacity for budgeting and other normal fiscal duties, shutdowns have become a more significant part of our experience. that's because since the 1990s, parties have considered shutdowns as political opportunities. we score these events like games: which team won and which team lost. the idea is that no one is supposed to win. a shutdown is an embarrassment and a reflection of governmental incompetence. what's obvious now is that those ideas carry less sting then they did 40 years ago when they were instituted. so maybe we need to, as you suggest, increase the pain.]

'you add a hurricane, and it's just too much,' said mike vinzant, a 32-year-old guard and the president of the local prison officers' union. if nature can be blamed for creating the first financial hardship, the second is the result of the even less predictable whims in washington…
