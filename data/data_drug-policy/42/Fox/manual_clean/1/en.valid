Yet Venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of Cuba, Iran, China, Russia and Turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against Venezuela, and this year Turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela. And Russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent Maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.
In a news conference Thursday night, Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22 amid demands from the White House that any federal spending bill include funding for a wall on the southern border.
Beijing has complained that the U.S. was flying its citizens out of Wuhan but not providing any assistance to China.
This is a type of illegal behavior! the statement said.
Fox News' Gregg Re and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.
But with mass migration, comes surges in what some deem xenophobia toward Venezuelans, what others claim to be integration problems, and what others characterize as one citizen's need to put their own families first, over that of legal and illegal arrivals.
Please rest easy, I will most certainly actively cooperate with the treatment and seek to obtain an early discharge! Li wrote on Jan. 31. He posted again on Feb. 1, saying he had been confirmed as having the virus.
The migration in 2018 has been fast and fleeting. Ecuador, for one, went from seeing the entry of thirty to forty Venezuelans per month to a peak of around 90,000 in May this year. A second wave hit in October, and at least 70,000 a month have been entering since.
Additional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held.
Wuhan has built two new prefabricated hospitals in recent weeks and is adapting gymnasiums, exhibition centers and other spaces for patients were milder symptoms. Thousands of additional military and civilian medical workers have been sent to the city.
WATCH: TRUMP HOLDS SURPRISE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH BORDER PATROL UNION
The depth of the catastrophe threatens to unravel the stability and wreak financial havoc beyond just Latin America - with little end in sight. It's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to Moises Rendon, associate director and fellow for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
Jobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the Venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. Antonio Ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of Caracas and opposition leader now exiled in Spain, told Fox News more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.
Trump met with Pelosi and other senior Democrats at a contentious meeting on Wednesday in the White House Situation Room, which included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen within five seconds, according to Republicans at the meeting. The sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new Congress was seated Thursday.
People who crossed before had at least a few dollars in their pocket for basic needs. Now they have absolutely nothing, said Victor Bautista, director for development and border integration at the foreign ministry in Colombia. In just six months, we went from 170 thousand migrants here to one million. Sixteen months ago, we had just 32,000. Something must be done. The humanitarian issues are unbelievable, and they will hurt the entire region.
One U.S government official closely monitoring the case told Fox News that while official displacement camps have not yet been established, calling this a last resort it is an option on the table being considered.
The impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to Chile or Colombia, while others ventured to Peru or Argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.

Meanwhile, a newborn discovered infected 36 hours after birth has become the youngest known patient. Doctors said other infected mothers have given birth to babies who tested negative, so it is not yet known if the virus can be transmitted in the womb.
The rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.
I've only been able to send money home to Venezuela on two occasions, lamented Yondel Alestre, 24, explaining that few in the shelter where he stays own a smartphone, making it difficult to contact family members. My wife is in Colombia, where she had to go to give birth as there was no medical care in Venezuela. My other children are with my mother in Venezuela and I have to stay in Ecuador to try to work.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Thursday that Japan will deny entry of foreign passengers on another cruise ship — Holland America's cruise ship Westerdam, on its way to Okinawa from Hong Kong — because of suspected virus patients found on board. The Seattle-based operator denied anyone had virus.
This whole border security crisis … it really, I believe, is a manufactured crisis, he said, adding that it's distracting from issues like health care and education.
Trump and his allies say Democrats, many of whom supported border security measures in the past, are only bucking the calls now because of knee-jerk opposition to his administration.
Pay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. Last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.
The police action against the eight whistleblowers also garnered a rare and extremely subtle rebuke from the nation's highest court. We have the responsibility to express to society our legal thoughts about solving the problem of rumors, a posting on the court's Weibo account said.

Over the past fiscal year, the United States has already given almost $100 million – distributed through the Department of State and other agencies – to assist in the humanitarian response to the regional Venezuela contingency. In September, the U.S. pledged a further $48 million. Moreover, the Department of Defense spending in the region over the past year totaled more than $110 million.
The pay-go principle, Ocasio-Cortez charged in a tweet Wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.
Fox News' Chad Pergram and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.
Democratic leaders are doubling down on accusations that President Trump's description of a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is manufactured, as the president prepares to visit the front-lines on the heels of his Oval Office address to the nation.
In most towns and cities across Latin America, bus terminals have become sleeping hubs for new arrivals from Venezuela – but often raising the ire of authorities who have been purporting to dismantle them – given they, too, have become hubs for drug dealing, crime, sexual assault, and other illicit activities.
The message is very simple: This is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said afterward.
He also wrote that he had not in fact had his medical license revoked, a reference to the sort of extrajudicial retaliation the communist authorities meet out to rights lawyers and others seen as troublemakers.
Response for Venezuelans, the coordination platform for refugees and migrants, documents at least 16 countries that now need assistance in tending to the ever-burgeoning mass migration flow.

We sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. The president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. And we will do that. And we will have a discussion. Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.
But she refuses to give up and shut down. I have to help because I understand what they are going through, why they have to leave, Duque said.
Overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, House Democrats on Thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees.
Portions of the rules had also provided that the House has the authority to defend ObamaCare, which was recently ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, in court.

It wasn't so long ago that Colombians were fleeing en masse to Venezuela – then the richest nation in Latin America, which still holds the largest known oil reserves in the world – as a simmering 50-year civil war raged on. While the tables have abruptly turned, most Colombians are eager to return the generosity.
Japan on Friday reported 41 new cases of a virus on a quarantined cruise ship and turned away another luxury liner while the death toll in mainland China rose to 636, including a doctor who got in trouble with authorities in the communist country for sounding an early warning about the disease threat.

Ultimately, the buck stops with local governments who are then in-charge of tending to the minors, with local aid agencies doing their best to offer guidance and support to the already overwhelmed government bodies.
Pelosi responded: President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.
You have a humanitarian and economic collapse, mass immigration and the government cracking down along with institutional collapse, he said. Combine all these aspects together, and Venezuela is fast becoming a threat for the civility of the whole region.
However, Pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it.
Shortly after Pelosi's historic return to the House speakership, Trump made his first-ever appearance in the White House briefing room to congratulate Pelosi and reaffirm his commitment to the border wall.

Other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.
The UN is projecting that at least two million more Venezuelans will flee their crumbling country over the course of the year.

That bill, which the White House has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.
At one small hut near the border town of Cucuta, some 300 mostly women and children pass through to recharge their phones, get some sleep and soup, and pick up an item of clothing from the Samaritan's Purse donation mound.
And for that reason, they are squalid, dirty and dangerous places for vulnerable Venezuelans. Officials refer to those leaving Venezuela as being a mixed migration flow rather than refugees.
It's really rough what the migrants have gone through. Everyone is frustrated, depressed, said Marcelo Viteli, the General Manager of the Resting House where up to 80 migrants are permitted to seek shelter for a few months after arrival.

Speaking Wednesday on Fox News' America's Newsroom, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez echoed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's language.
The Maduro regime has – for the most part – denied the existence of a major crisis in its country, instead blaming the US- and US-supported political foe for waging economic war.
I promise you, if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol union, told the media after Trump's introductory remarks. I worked in Naco, Ariz., for ten years. We didn't have physical barriers in Naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.

The House late Thursday ultimately passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.8, by a 239 to 192 vote.

Although more than 3.3 million Venezuelans are estimated to have left the country since 2015, only a small portion – for example, just 11,000 in Ecuador – have applied for asylum.
And, although hats have been barred in the House chamber for more than a century, a new House rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear. That means the rules will still preclude Democratic Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson from wearing her signature cowboy hats on the House floor -- but Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.

In several soup kitchens and shelters, separate lines and dining areas have had to be set up separate the poor locals from the Venezuelans, as to avoid any contention.
How the two sides will bridge this difference – and how long they will resist a compromise – remains unclear. The mounting impact of the partial shutdown, which initially was limited but will increase as more federal workers miss paychecks this cycle and services like those at national parks suffer, is likely to increase pressure on Congress and the White House to forge a deal in the coming days.
What has been shocking to me is I am seeing parallels to other places I have worked – Afghanistan and Mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. People have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. It is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the Venezuela crisis all the more important.
Neighboring countries have subsequently been forced to deal with spikes in crimes, sex, and drug trafficking, and criminals – both from Venezuela and from home nations – seeking to take advantage of those most desperate amid the calamity.

The U.N High Commissioner for Refugees stated that humanitarian organizations will require $738 million to provide vital services such as food and shelters to help ease the burden on receiving nations.
DEMS ACCUSE TRUMP OF 'MALICE' AFTER BORDER SPEECH
On Tuesday, Trump underscored cases of Americans killed allegedly by illegal immigrants, including California police Cpl.

On Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.
PAMPLONA, Colombia – A little girl plays with her mother's identification card – tossing, catching and guarding it fiercely. It's the only thing she has to call her own.
The fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat; they are a humanitarian challenge, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the joint Democratic rebuttal alongside Schumer.
We shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added. But, Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill fired back, tweeting: A vote AGAINST the Democratic Rules package is a vote to let [Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)] Mick Mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing Democratic initiatives and funding increases.

It first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, Todd Chapman, the U.S Ambassador to Ecuador, told Fox News.
