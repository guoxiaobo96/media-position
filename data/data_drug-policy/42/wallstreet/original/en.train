Dear Moneyist,\n\nMy husband cheated on me, moved out of our home, and moved in with his girlfriend in October 2019. He stopped paying all the bills and doesn't pay child support, or much of anything. He filed for divorce, but because we are unable to finish paying the lawyers, our divorce is on pause.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has deposited all the stimulus money into his account, and he will not share it with me. I finally started working this past October, and this most current stimulus check went to him again! Why did I not receive my own?\n\nWe have one minor child, and he took her share as well.\n\nStill Married,\n\nDear Married,\n\nYou may not have received a check because you did not file a tax return.\n\nIt's not 100% clear from your letter whether you have a formal separation agreement. The IRS has clear instructions on reporting people who falsely claim dependents. There are exceptions to the rules, but a child must live with the qualifying parent for more than half of the calendar year.\n\nYour estranged husband should tread carefully, as you have not lived together for over a year. When you knowingly claim a false dependent on your taxes, you risk sanctions and a potential audit from the IRS, according to CommunityTax.com.\n\nGiven the unclear legal status of your marriage, you could use the IRS policy as leverage when speaking to your husband. You can also follow the IRS instructions on reporting false claims regarding dependents, if that is what has happened here.\n\nThe government is using the IRS database as a way to determine people's eligibility for the stimulus payments. They are recoverable rebate credits on your 2020 return. The IRS is using 2019 tax returns to gauge people's incomes; 2018 tax returns are used as a Plan B.\n\nThis is not the first letter of this kind I have received during the pandemic about spouses pilfering stimulus payments. And it won't be the last. Yours may be less clear cut than some of the other cases, but I would not give up hope on receiving your due in 2021 just yet.\n\nThe Moneyist: I filed for bankruptcy after rehabbing my husband's home. Now he wants an open marriage and says I own nothing. I feel trapped and bamboozled\n\nPrevious letters have included financial abuse: This husband actually took the economic stimulus payment from his wife, a classic case of financial abuse where the abuser controls all the finances to maintain the power over his or her spouse in the relationship.\n\nIn another such case, this former wife forged her husband's signature on an IRS tax form (a classic case of old-fashioned fraud) and one that could be punishable with a custodial sentence, if it could be proven that she acted maliciously and/or with criminal intent.\n\nIn the hat-trick of skulduggery of The Moneyist's archive, this ex-wife dipped into her former husband's bank account and helped herself to his stimulus payment (a classic case of sharp practice, given that she had every right to withdraw money from a joint account).\n\nYour case highlights the importance of filing a tax return with the IRS and keeping track of bank accounts. You can make a note of your husband's refusal to hand this over during any future divorce proceedings. A judge is unlikely to look kindly on such stingy stimulus shenanigans.\n\nHello there, MarketWatchers.

Investors may be set to relive memories of the infamous bond-market 'taper tantrum' of 2013 when U.S. Treasury yields rose after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the breaks on its quantitative easing program of bond buying.\n\nThat's a real risk according to Jefferies chief financial economist Aneta Markowska who warns the benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.663% could spiral higher as Democratic candidates look set to win the two U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia.\n\nIn a Wednesday note, Markowska estimates the benchmark maturity could now climb to 2% at the end of this year as investors turn to the possibility that the Federal Reserve may contemplate an earlier liftoff from ultra-low interest rates than had been expected.\n\nHer allusion to 'taper tantrums' will reawaken painful memories for the bond bulls.\n\nBack in 2013, the suggestion of a reduction in bond purchases by then Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke sent panic into global bond markets, and sent the 10-year yield rising around 1.40 percentage points in the span of four months.\n\nLike then, Treasurys have been on the backfoot in recent weeks. On Wednesday, the 10-year note climbed 9.4 basis points to 1.05%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.446% surged 12.7 basis points to 1.831%. Both long-dated maturities reached their highest levels since March.\n\nSee: Warnock projected to win Georgia Senate race, as Ossoff clings to slim lead\n\nMarkowksa says investors will start to price in an earlier end to the Fed's ultra-accommodative policy if they anticipate the administration of President-elect Biden, with the aid of a Democratic-controlled Congress, will introduce more fiscal stimulus to bolster economic recovery.\n\nShe expected an additional fiscal package of another $1 trillion, on top of the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill signed in December.\n\nUnder her new calculations, U.S. economy growth would rise and the unemployment rate would fall to 4% next year.\n\nInflation, in turn, would climb to the Fed's target of 2% around in early 2023, positioning the U.S. central bank to start lifting interest rates around then, a full year ahead of schedule.\n\nThe Fed's dot plot, a survey of what its panel of policymaking officials forecast where interest rates are headed, shows the majority of its members expect the federal funds rate to start rising in 2024.
South Dakota, home of Mount Rushmore, topped the list of states with the most inbound movers in 2016, and it's mostly for the jobs.\n\nThe state, which has seen a 23% increase in people moving to the state in the last five years, took the No. 1 spot for the first time, beating Oregon, which had been in the top place for the past three years. South Dakota also attracted those looking to live closer to family and retire, according to the 40th annual moving study by St. Louis-based moving company United Van Lines. The study based its findings on states' inbound and outbound percentages compared to total moves the company handles.\n\nOf the people moving to South Dakota, 60% came for jobs. The state is home to financial services firms, like Citibank C, +0.33% , and has a low unemployment rate and reasonable home prices, said Michael Stoll, an economist and professor and chair of the Department of Public Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, who worked with United Van Lines on the study. High demand jobs with high wages in South Dakota include registered nurses, accountants and auditors, general and operations managers, elementary school teachers, secondary school teachers and management analysts, according to the South Dakota Dept. of Labor & Regulation.\n\nThere are more pull factors than push factors, Stoll said. The unemployment rate in South Dakota was 2.7% in November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared with the U.S.'s unemployment rate that same month of 4.6%. The median home in South Dakota is about $170,000, according to real estate website Zillow's home value index.\n\nThe top inbound states after South Dakota were Vermont, Oregon, Idaho, South Carolina, Washington state, then Washington, D.C., North Carolina, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nSee: How to write off your moving expenses\n\nMoving for a new job or a job transfer was most common for those relocating, alongside establishing a household, in 2015, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. There are some states, like South Dakota, with a fair amount of inbound and outbound movers relocating for jobs, including California and Massachusetts, Stoll said.\n\nThere are benefits to moving for a job, experts said. People who have the best career experiences are willing to relocate, said Chad Oakley, chief executive officer of global executive search firm Charles Aris in Greensboro, N.C, adding that individuals who relocate for work are likely to see a bigger jump in compensation than those who stay where they are.\n\nSee also:How much is your paycheck worth in another city? Try the MarketWatch cost-of-living calculator\n\nRelocating also shows an employer that you're flexible, and provides you with new skills and experiences, such as working with a new group of people and learning new standards, practices and approaches to your job, Oakley said.\n\nThis new office trend lets you lie down at work\n\nOf course moving for a job is not for everyone, including the family members of those wanting to relocate for work. If you're considering relocation, consider the needs of your family members, such as a spouse who might be looking for a new job for the next three to six months or kids and their education and hobbies. You can really negatively impact your family by blindly making that move, Oakley said.\n\nAs South Dakota and other states take in more residents, others are naturally losing out, primarily in the Northeast and Midwest. The top 10 states losing residents are New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Utah and Pennsylvania.\n\nFor employees whose companies are perhaps doing poorly and asking them to move away to a rural area, there could be consequences â€” if the job were not to work out, there might not be many other prospects, Oakley said. The South, for example, has seen less movers coming in for jobs, likely because of how hard hit the locations were in oil and gas, Stoll said.
An ugly, year-end stock-market selloff and the return of volatility has put the economic expansion, soon to be the longest on record, under the microscope. Cyclical sectors, such as housing, are slowing, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.\n\nThe risks to the economy seem to be multiplying, from trade tensions to national security threats to a president who prefers to conduct the nation's affairs via Twitter.\n\nThe question everyone is asking is: Are the gut-wrenching ups and downs in the U.S. stock market just noise? Or is the flirtation with a bear market an early warning sign of what the U.S. economy can expect in 2019?\n\nThe Fed will be the ultimate arbiter of how things play out.\n\nIt is said that the stock market SPX, -0.16% is not the economy, and that's true. But the stock market does convey certain information and expectations about things that affect the economy, and are affected by it, such as corporate earnings. And those profit expectations have been tempered after the spectacular, double-digit gains in 2018. (Year-over-year comparisons become more challenging next year.)\n\nIn 2019 we will learn whether the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, was truly a stimulus for productivity-enhancing capital investment or merely a stimulus for profits.\n\nBusiness fixed-investment did accelerate in the first half of 2018, rising 11.5% in the first quarter and 8.7% in the second, before reverting to a 2.5% increase in the third. A good chunk of the tax cut went to stock buybacks, which exceeded a record $1 trillion in 2018.\n\nThe U.S. economy, meanwhile, is not sending out alarm bells just yet.\n\nAvailable data point to an economy still operating near full employment. At 3.7%, the civilian unemployment rate sits at a 49-year low. Wages are finally rising at a 3% rate for the first time since the Great Recession. And consumers opened their wallets during the Christmas shopping season. The 5.1% increase in holiday sales was the biggest in the last six years, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.\n\nThat doesn't mean the economic outlook is without risks. The sharp widening in credit spreads over the last three months, both high-yield and investment grade, seems to be mirroring the stress in the stock market.\n\nHousing, which has been a reluctant participant throughout this business cycle after overplaying its hand in the previous one, has peaked. Yet even at the high point for single-family housing starts earlier this year, builders were breaking ground on new homes at rates that paled in comparison to those of previous expansions over the last half century.\n\nGlobal synchronized growth has turned to a synchronized slowdown, which means reduced demand for U.S. goods and services. Still, the overall decline in industrial commodity prices has been less scary than the dive in energy prices since October.\n\nThe geopolitical situation is replete with opportunities for disruption and chaos.\n\nA trade war with China remains a distinct possibility. The terms of the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, have yet to be determined. France is dealing with anti-government street protests, triggered by an announced fuel tax, since abandoned, and a push for a higher minimum wage. Italy and the European Union, which were at loggerheads over Italy's budget, have come to some kind of an agreement that will allow Europe's fourth-largest economy to avoid sanctions for now.\n\nIn short, the liberal world order created after World War II and the institutions created to promote democratic ideals and international trade and prevent another outbreak of hostilities is being threatened by nationalist and populist movements across the globe.\n\nThe effect of any, or all, or these developments has the potential to rattle the stock market and disrupt the economic expansion. But none is as easy to identify as our own domestic provocateur, the Fed.\n\nOne of the many reasons cited for the stock market's recent jitters was the Fed's Dec. 19 rate increase and projections for additional hikes next year, along with continue balance sheet reduction.\n\nWhile the stock market was having a hissy fit, over in the fixed-income market, federal funds futures pretty much removed the likelihood of any additional rate hikes in 2019. And if there is one thing that Fed policy makers' pay attention, even cater, to, it is market expectations.\n\nBased on the December 2019 fed funds futures contract, the market is placing a greater probability on a rate cut than a rate hike by the end of the year.\n\nIf the Fed defers to the market's forecast, as it did in 2016, then it could engineer one of the rare soft landings in central bank history.\n\nIf, instead, the Fed persists is raising the funds rate to the point that it exceeds the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a recession would be the likely outcome. The average lead time for the term spread at business-cycle peaks â€” that is, the time between inversion and onset of recession â€” is 13.5-14 months, according to the Conference Board, the proprietor of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, of which the term spread is first among equals.\n\nThe stock market seems more concerned about what the Fed says. I, for one, am content to wear earplugs but plan to monitor closely what policy makers do with the funds rate relative to the long-term rate.
With the Dow Jones Industrial Average smashing through 25,000 last week, few are looking at the bond market, where the flattening of the Treasury yield curve continues.\n\nThe difference between the 10-year Treasury note's yield and the two-year Treasury note's yield has now shrunk to 50 basis points. This is the definition of a shrinking yield curve slope, which is completely normal in a mature economic expansion (see chart).\n\nThe economic expansion, for those keeping count, turned 8Â½ years in length at the end of December 2017, the third-longest in 240 years. The longest such expansion lasted exactly 10 years â€” from 1991 to 2001. Yet, the stock market keeps marching higher with no recession in sight.\n\nThe question begs to be asked: Should you buy stocks in a flattening yield curve environment, which typically indicates a slowing economy in six to 12 months?\n\nRead:The man who called a new bull market in 2012 says take your profits now\n\nStocks move based on an improving profit outlook, which the last time I checked was still improving. It is well-known that the bond market is often early and moves before the stock market does. I have seen the stock market make an all-time high at a time when the Treasury yield curve was inverted and certain mortgage bonds were crashing in October 2007. The yield curve is not yet inverted, nor do we have similar stress in mortgage bonds or junk bonds for that matter, so the yield curve could shrink further and the stock market could still rise.\n\nThe Fed's influence\n\nWhy is the yield curve shrinking? Simply put, Federal Reserve policy (see chart). The two-year note is most sensitive to Fed policy and heavily correlated to the federal funds rate, as both are deemed to be short-term, risk-free rates. If the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% , which is more sensitive to economic growth and inflation, does not rise as much as the yield on the two-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , the yield curve shrinks (see chart).\n\nThe problem is that the yield curve was a fine indicator of economic performance when the 10-year Treasury note yield was driven by market forces. With quantitative easing, this is not so much the case. When the Fed begins to unwind its balance sheet in earnest, it could also push the 10-year Treasury note yield higher â€” as it is happening now â€” in effect, controlling the yield curve and pushing against an inversion, which has preceded every one of the last five recessions.\n\nWhy Warren Buffett still uses a flip phone\n\nOne has to wonder if the yield curve would be as good an indicator this time around because of the Fed's balance-sheet dynamics. At $10 billion in monthly balance-sheet runoffs, the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's $4.4 trillion balance sheet is not a big deal today. The question is: At what run-off rate would that begin to affect the Treasury market more aggressively â€” $20 billion, $30 billion or $50 billion?\n\nThere are four federal funds rate increases expected by the market in 2018, for about 100 basis points in tightening by the Federal Reserve. If the federal funds rate were to rise by 100 basis points from 1.5% at present to 2.5%, then the two-year Treasury note yield would be at 3% or higher, as historically the correlation between the two has been very close. That means that if the 10-year Treasury yield stays below 3% â€” and that is the $4.4 trillion question â€” then the yield curve would likely invert in 2018.\n\nThe Fed's short volatility position\n\nOn Feb. 5, Jerome Powell will become the Federal Reserve's new chairman. He is an accomplished financial-services industry executive and also a graduate of Georgetown Law School. Still, I do not recall any recent Federal Reserve chairpersons who did not have a doctorate in economics.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer left in October for personal reasons (most likely because he realized he had no chance of ever becoming Fed chairman). Janet Yellen did not get nominated for a second term, and the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William Dudley, is retiring this year. That means the top three people at the Fed are leaving more or less at the same time, just as the Fed is getting ready to unwind its $4.4 trillion balance sheet (see chart).\n\nI would have felt a lot better if the people that grew this enormous balance sheet were there when the unwinding process got going in earnest. This is because of a concern that Powell, then a Fed governor, voiced in 2012, which was on my mind throughout this whole quantitative-easing business. Powell was quoted by ZeroHedge last week (from the transcripts of the Oct. 23-24, 2012, FOMC meeting):\n\nSo when it is time for us to sell, or even to stop buying, the response could be quite strong; there is every reason to expect a strong response. So there are a couple of ways to look at it. It is about $1.2 trillion in sales; you take 60 months, you get about $20 billion a month. That is a very doable thing, it sounds like, in a market where the norm by the middle of next year is $80 billion a month. Another way to look at it, though, is that it's not so much the sale, the duration; it's also unloading our short volatility position. When you turn and say to the market, 'I've got $1.2 trillion of these things,' it's not just $20 billion a month â€” it's the sight of the whole thing coming. And I think there is a pretty good chance that you could have quite a dynamic response in the market.\n\nWell, the time to sell is now. The Fed is in effect unloading its short volatility position on the market in 2018. What do you think will happen to stock and bond volatility this year in that scenario?\n\nIvan Martchev is an investment strategist with institutional money manager Navellier and Associates.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez notwithstanding, the big winners in the midterms were moderate Democrats. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other party leaders carefully salted swing districts with young candidates who appealed to minorities, college-educated women and suburbanites who want solutions to problems in their daily lives, not a socialist revolution.\n\nThe Great Blue wave of radical progressivism never materialized. Elizabeth Warren, who led a national effort to elect progressive candidates like Richard Cordray for governor in Ohio and Katie Porter for the House in California, largely flamed out.\n\nThe moderate Democrats who snatched Republican seats mostly ran on clean government and incremental improvements to health care â€” not mindless opposition to President Donald Trump or advocacy of socialized medicine.\n\nStill health-care costs have spun out of sight, because the Affordable Care Act enables drug companies, hospitals, large insurers and large-group practices of specialists to monopolize and impose outlandish prices in national and regional markets.\n\nJust as Democrats should give up on the idea of a single-payer system based on confiscatory taxes on upper-income Americans, Republicans must wake up to the hard reality that competition in many health-care markets is rigged.\n\nIn a divided Congress, oversight could cast a discerning focus on monopoly exploitation to coax a reluctant Justice Department to start prosecuting abusers. Together, the two parties need to fashion legislation that requires drug companies, hospitals, insurers and medical professionals to benchmark prices against those fetched in prosperous northern European countries with insurance-based payments systems.\n\nAn increasingly urban society requires better commuter-mass transit and intercity connections. Financing infrastructure runs smack into the exorbitant costs imposed by cumbersome regulations and costly delays imposed by federal, state and local agencies. Engaging Trump on regulatory reform and encouraging a special dialogue with governors about prohibitive delays could help.\n\nStill trillions more dollars are needed but the federal deficit is already too big and someone has to pay. Many members of Congress reflexively balk at higher gas taxes and user-fees solutions but Leaders Pelosi and Chuck Schumer could triangulate the issue with Trump.\n\nOn immigration, the movement toward a common-sense compromise to realign U.S. policy to place great emphasis on admitting immigrants with skills in short supply, a greater capacity to quickly assimilate and attributes less threatening to struggling rural communities has some bipartisan support, but little enthusiasm from the Democratic leadership.\n\nThe Supreme Court may soon permit Trump to end President Barack Obama's DACA program and that would force reluctant Democrats to the table on broader reforms. If they balk, those young people face deportation and neither party should count on exploiting that spectacle â€” incumbents of all stripes would catch voters' ire.\n\nOn trade and the broader economy, Democratic congressional leaders like to exploit Trump's missteps â€” for example, putting tariffs on imported components that force U.S. manufacturers to offshore even more and his targeting of our allies with tariffs.\n\nMany Democrats in Congress recognize China's criminal behavior is a menace to American prosperity and security. A steady, private dialogue that links their support for congressional approval of the new North American free trade deal to Trump trading in his spray gun for a more focused trade rifle would help broaden their party's appeal to working-class voters.\n\nTrump's economy is doing well and finally raising wages. Able-bodied adults on the sidelines are rejoining the workforce but to maintain an elevated pace of growth without running into crippling shortages of engineers, technicians and other skilled workers requires Democrats to support immigration reform and make the recent tax cuts permanent.\n\nThat will require the Democrats to shelve their tropism for higher taxes on upper-income Americans and for the president to give up on yet more budget-busting tax cuts. Alternatively, both sides could go after the carried interest tax break for Wall Street's financial engineers â€” those levy lower capital gains tax rates on income that should rightly be classified as wage income.\n\nAll this may disappoint the combative political instincts of Pelosi and Trump but winning long-term majoritiesâ€”holding power by governing effectivelyâ€”requires moving to where the American people really standâ€”in the pragmatic center.
The Japanese yen might just be the overall winner of the haven sweepstakes that accompanied the China-led global stock-market rout on Monday.\n\nThe dollar slumped 0.8% versus the Japanese yen USDJPY, +0.19% Monday, while the euro EURJPY, -0.35% lost more than 1% versus its Japanese rival.\n\nBut a happy first trading day of 2016 for yen bulls might mean more rough tumult for equity-market bulls trying to find their bearings in what's shaped up as the roughest start to a new year for the Dow since 1932.\n\nIt might seem like a bit of a chicken-and-egg conundrum. After all, the yen rally is usually attributed to haven flows amid market turmoil. But analysts note the yen has tended to have a strong inverse relationship with the Nikkei NIK, +1.01% and other equities, including the S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% .\n\nChris Kimble of Kimble Charting Solutions, who has written a lot about the yen and stocks, offered this Monday:\n\nIn a Monday note, Matt Weller, senior market analyst at Forex.com, focused on the yen's strength against the Australian dollar AUDJPY, +0.01% :\n\nAUD/JPY in particular is worth watching. Beyond representing a global proxy for risk appetite and the carry trade, the pair also has a strong correlation with major equity indices and so far, the outlook appears bleak. With today's drop, AUD/JPY has fallen conclusively below the four-month bullish trend line off the August lows, carving out a potential large Bearish Marubozu Candle* in the process. For the uninitiated, this pattern shows strong selling pressure and often portends more weakness in the coming days.\n\nThe Aussie was down around 2.7% versus the yen.\n\nOf course, while Monday's moves may be dramatic, there is plenty for investors to trade on in the days, weeks and months ahead. This week's overall performance, in fact, might still very well be dictated by the reaction to the December U.S. jobs report on Friday. After all, investors will undoubtedly still be reading the data for clues as to the timing and pace of future Fed interest-rate increases as the U.S. central bank tries to normalize monetary policy in 2016.\n\nBut with all that in mind, perhaps Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale offered up the most meteorologically sound advice:
President Trump on Saturday extended protections from deportation for some undocumented immigrants in the U.S., particularly those fleeing violent Central American countries, in exchange for a requested $5.7 billion to build the southern border wall that the Democratic leadership repeated is a non-starter as part of spending talks.\n\nTrump extended his offer, which critics stressed only restored some protections the president had recently taken away by executive order, as the government remained partially shuttered for a 29th day, its funding hung up over border security and other immigration matters. Trump also asked for funding for the humanitarian crisis for young children and vulnerable immigrants making the crossing, and for other security and drug prevention measures.\n\nThis is a common-sense compromise both parties should embrace, Trump said from the White House, saying he would deliver on a border security campaign promise one way or another and that he would not hand over immigration issues to the radical left.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement before Trump spoke, but in response to reports covering what he would say, said Trump's update on the border was to her a rehash of already rejected proposals. She called the proposal unacceptable and raised doubt about its passage in the Democrat-controlled House. She was also critical that the Trump plan did not give priority to reopening the partially closed government first, before resuming border security talks.\n\nTrump did not directly address furloughed government workers in his address Saturday.\n\nTrump proposed extending for three years protections for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, a step that early reports, including by the Wall Street Journal, was seen as a major concession inside the White House. Democrats have advocated for a path to permanent citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, although the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program so far provides temporary protections; it was created by President Obama via executive order after no action in Congress that frustrated the then-president. Pelosi reiterated this desire for permanency on Saturday, as has Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democrat who wrote the BRIDGE legislation that would extend this status.\n\nThe Trump plan also extends the legality of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders to three additional years; the policy typically protects immigrants fleeing violence and hardships.Trump said his plan would allow Central American minors, many running from gangs, to apply for asylum, but in their home countries, not at the border as is currently in place.\n\nAn Axios report earlier Saturday detailing the $5.7 billion steel barrier funding proposal and the temporary immigrant protection extensions, also said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told Trump that Pelosi is unlikely to concede to end the partial shutdown without White House action, especially in the wake of her letter telling the president not to deliver the State of the Union address.\n\nTrump has said that extending existing border barriers is needed to curb illegal immigration along the southern border and he used Saturday's address to stress immigrant-linked crime accusations, statistics that data agencies have refuted. Trump asked for $800 million each for humanitarian care at the border, which he said targets children and vulnerable travelers brought over to help the status of other adults crossing alongside the minors and $805 million for drug trafficking prevention efforts.\n\nMost Democrats say extending the wall is an ineffective and expensive measure, stressing that most alleged immigration policy abuse comes from immigrants who overstay their legal permissions. Some have pointed to the vulnerabilities of a wall without boosting security technology or manpower; others argue that Trump is clinging to a vanity campaign promise whose funding plans have shifted. The White House's plan was seen as particularly vulnerable in a now Democrat-controlled House.\n\nThe new White House position was negotiated by the president's senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Vice President Mike Pence, aides said, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other reports said immigration hardliner Stephen Miller had participated.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) â€” A measure of small-business optimism showed an unusual split in December, as owners became more confident about sales at the same time they become more pessimistic about business conditions.\n\nThe National Federation of Independent Business reported that its small-business optimism index edged up 0.4 points to a reading of 95.2. The readings have ranged between 94.1 and 98 in 2015.
The Pimco Total Return Fund returned a meager 0.7% in 2015, according to data from Morningstar Inc., but that was enough to beat the fund managed by its founder and former star trader.\n\nBill Gross, who shocked investors when he abruptly quit Pacific Investment Management Co. LLC, or Pimco, in 2014 in a cloud of acrimony to join Janus Capital Group Inc. US:JNS and start the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund JUCAX, , has just completed his first full year in that role.\n\nThe fund had a negative return of 0.7% for 2015, according to Morningstar.\n\nHowever, that compares favorably with the Pimco Unconstrained Bond Fund PUBAX, , which had a negative return of 2.8%. That fund has about $6.5 billion in assets, while the Janus fund has $1.3 billion in assets.\n\nThe Pimco Total Return Fund PTTRX, is much larger, with about $92 billion in assets. At its peak, the Pimco fund was the biggest in the world, with assets of about $293 billion in 2013.\n\nPimco is owned by the German insurer Allianz AG ALV, +1.85% .\n\nThe Pimco Total Return fund outperformed Morningstar's U.S. open-end intermediate-term bond category for 2015, which had an average negative return of 0.3%.\n\nRead:These mutual-fund fumbles cost investors real money in 2015\n\nThe Janus fund also can boast of doing better than the norm; it outperformed Morningstar's U.S. open-end nontraditional bond category, which has had an average negative return of 1.5%.\n\nThe best returns in the Pimco category were achieved by the River Canyon Total Return fund RCTIX, +0.09% , at 5.1%. That was followed by the DoubleLine Selective Credit fund DBSCX, , with a return of 3.8%.\n\nIn the other category, Parametric Absolute Return fund US:EOAIX took the top spot, with a 6.1% return, followed by the 5.2% return of Arrow Alternative Solutions ASFFX, .\n\nThe Treasury market returned 0.8% for the year, based on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Master Index.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. energy sector will see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings this year given the outlook for continued low oil prices, said Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan on Monday. The overall tone in the oil and gas sector has soured, as expectations have decidedly shifted to an 'even lower for even longer' price outlook in the wake of the December OPEC meeting, Kaplan said in a speech in Dallas. Economists at the Dallas Fed forecast that global excess inventories aren't likely to begin falling until 2017, and there is a risk that it will take longer, he said. Given the various cross-currents, the ultimate timing of reaching market production/consumption balance remains uncertain, he added. Kaplan is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year. He said he was in favor of the December interest-rate increase, the first since 2006.
In early 2020, John Larson, the president of Oregon Education Association, the state's teacher's union, was preparing to head to Minneapolis for a national conference on what he and fellow teacher advocates were worried was becoming, as Larson put it, a crisis: Too few teachers to meet the needs of the nation's schools.\n\nWe were going to meet and start talking about strategies for encouraging people to go into the teaching profession, Larson said. Those tactics include fostering interest in teaching as a second career or creating an affordable path to a teaching license for professionals with an aptitude for teaching. We have a lot of really talented instructional assistants in this state and oftentimes the only reason they're not certified teachers is because they didn't have the time or money to go to college, he said.\n\nBut the conference, which had been scheduled for March, never happened. The pandemic hit and we cancelled that meeting, Larson said.\n\nNow the crisis he had hoped to discuss at the conference has grown even more acute. Larson said he's worried that the challenges involved in operating school systems during the pandemic will only make it more difficult to find enough teachers to fill classrooms going forward. Some of his members have taken long-term leave during the pandemic. Others have used the opportunity to retire early because they're in a high-risk category.\n\nRight now, Oregon schools are largely online, but safely returning to in-person instruction will likely require more teachers to cut down on class sizes, he said. This pandemic has really amplified some of the problems that were already existing in our school system, Larson said.\n\nThe number of students enrolled in teacher prep programs was dropping even before the pandemic\n\nFears of a looming teacher shortage were growing even before the pandemic. Over the past decade the number of students studying to be educators has plummeted and the pandemic may only exacerbate some districts' challenges in finding teachers. Nearly 27% of educators said they were considering leaving the profession or taking a leave of absence because of COVID-19, according to a November survey published by Horace Mann Educators Corporation, which offers insurance and other financial products to educators.\n\nUnion officials like Larson said they've seen these trends firsthand. At the same time, some experts worry state budgets squeezed by the pandemic will usher in widespread teacher layoffs. Still, some teachers in training say they're more motivated to get into the profession than ever.\n\nBefore the pandemic, school officials in Michigan, North Carolina, Illinois and elsewhere were raising alarm about a shortage of teachers in their states. Because the labor market for teachers varies by locality and subject, it's hard to say what trends in those and other states mean for the supply of teachers nationwide.\n\nWhat is clear is the number of students studying to become teachers is down. More than one-third fewer students enrolled in teacher preparation programs in 2018 than in 2010, according to an analysis published in 2019 by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. In some states, enrollment in these programs dropped more than 50%, the analysis found.\n\nLisette Partelow, senior director of K-12 strategic initiatives at CAP and the author of the analysis, said there are a variety of reasons why enrollment in teacher preparation programs may have declined. One factor: widely reported teacher layoffs in the wake of the Great Recession may have discouraged aspiring teachers from entering the field, Partelow said.\n\nIn addition, the narrative surrounding the teaching profession has changed over the past several years. In a 2018 survey conducted by PDK International, an educator professional organization, 54% of parents said they didn't want their children to become teachers â€” the first time since the group started conducting the survey in 1969 that a majority of parents frowned upon their kids entering the field.\n\nWe don't do a good enough job of reframing what it means to be an educator, not only financially, but for your life, said Josh Starr, the chief executive officer of PDK International. While many assume a career in education means working as a classroom teacher your whole life, Starr noted educators have a variety of options, including climbing up a school system's career ladder, working in education-related policy, technology or other fields.\n\nThe narrow framing of what it means to be an educator combined with relatively low pay â€” the median pay for a high school teacher was $61,660 in 2019 â€” and decades of political battles over curriculum, the role of standardized testing and other issues have combined to create an environment where, teachers at the national level don't get the respect that they should, Starr said.\n\nThe 'demand side' is missing from the teacher shortage equation\n\nWhile these trends are concerning, it's hard to say whether they portend a nationwide teacher shortage â€” and one that could be exacerbated by the pandemic â€” Partelow said.\n\nThere's detailed data on the drop in enrollment in teacher preparation programs, but we don't have the other side of the equation, which is the demand side, Partelow said. In other words, it's hard to say whether the drop in supply in teachers is something to be really worried about or whether this is something that we can work with, she said.\n\nIn Manatee County, Fla., Pat Barber, the president of the local teacher's union, said she's worried the pandemic will only exacerbate a squeeze on the supply of teachers. Pre-COVID, the county's school system was reporting challenges filling vacancies. Over the course of the pandemic, some teachers have retired, resigned or taken leaves of absence because of the challenges surrounding teaching during this period.\n\nThe students' perception of what's going on now, how that will drive them and help them decide that they want to help students â€” that's yet to be seen, Barber said. It could make them think that this could be something that I could do better or I have this role-model teacher who has overcome all of these obstacles that were put in front of him or her.\n\nUncertainty about the future of University of South Florida's College of Education, which has been a source of new teachers in Manatee and the surrounding districts, is exacerbating concerns about the availability of new teachers in the region, Barber said. USF students intern in the county and are frequently hired to teach after their internships.\n\nOfficials announced in October that the school would undergo a strategic reimagining and reconfiguring that would ultimately phase out its undergraduate programs.\n\nOfficials clarified in November, saying that no final decisions have been made, regarding the school and that they've been meeting with school district superintendents, students and others as they think through the college's future. The university has committed to offering carefully selected undergraduate degrees in education, though likely fewer than what's currently available.\n\nThe announcements came amid a 63% drop in enrollment over the past decade and a period of significant budget challenges for the university. The pandemic has squeezed already stretched university business models.\n\nConner Diefendorf said he chose USF after working at a middle school for two years and seeing that many of the teachers and administrators he worked with had attended the school. In the wake of the school's first announcement, he started an online petition calling attention to the role the school plays in supplying teachers to the region.\n\nDiefendorf wasn't originally planning to attend college, but a history teacher pushed him towards it. The example of that teacher and Diefendorf's mom, who is also an educator, inspired him to enter the field. During the pandemic, he's watched his role models struggle to adjust to online learning and a changed in-person environment.\n\nI feel like a lot more people are appreciating the profession of teaching, he said of the pandemic period. But at the same time I still feel like there's nothing being done about it. Despite witnessing these experiences, his interest in the profession hasn't wavered, Diefendorf said.\n\n'I want to be that type of role model that students of color need'\n\nFor Jose Carrillo, part of what drew him to a career in teaching is the chance to be the role model to his students, something that he rarely experienced himself when he was growing up. Carrillo, a freshman at Texas State University studying education, said throughout his time at Title I public schools â€” those where low-income students make up at least 40% of the population â€” in Dallas, I noticed that there weren't that many teachers of color.\n\nThat's a big motivating force for me, said Carrillo, who is Hispanic. I want to be that type of role model that students of color need. I just feel like I can connect.\n\nJose Carrillo is studying to be a teacher.\n\nAbout three years ago, Carrillo joined Educators Rising, a division of PDK, that aims to help communities recruit and retain teachers and diversify the profession by fostering high school and college students' interest in teaching. The organization does this through school-based chapters and state and national competitions focused on teaching-related skills like creative lecturing and children's literature.\n\nParker Evatt joined the organization in ninth grade. Evatt first started to think about a career in teaching when in fourth grade he had his first-ever male teacher. That teacher inspired Evatt, now a junior at the University of Arkansas, to work to become a role model for students, like his fourth grade teacher was for him.\n\nParker Evatt joined Educators Rising in high school.\n\nIt's been hard to watch teachers with long, successful careers be forced to adjust to new technology and modes of teaching during the pandemic, Evatt said. But the experience hasn't turned him away from the profession. In fact, for both Evatt and Carrillo, watching students and teachers struggle with remote and modified in-person instruction has had the opposite effect.\n\nIt makes me want to get into the classroom right away â€” as quickly as possible, Evatt said.\n\n'A real squeeze on the profession'\n\nWhile some superintendents and labor leaders are concerned that the pandemic will make teachers difficult to find, Kate Walsh, the president of the National Council on Teacher Quality, a think tank that ranks teacher preparation programs and maintains a database of teacher contracts, said she worries the COVID-era may leave more teachers looking for work.\n\nWith state and local budgets squeezed by the pandemic and economic downturn â€” limiting the funding they can provide to schools â€” Walsh said it's likely schools will be laying off teachers in the coming months. Indeed, employment in local education, which includes teachers and others who work for schools, like custodians and cafeteria workers, has already dropped.\n\nYou're going to see a real squeeze on the profession, Walsh said, of the impact of pandemic-related cuts to school budgets.\n\nLearning classroom management with a mute button\n\nAspiring teachers like Madelyn Fox have already gotten a taste of the challenges educators are facing during this time. Fox, who is studying elementary education at the University of Michigan, has done all of her student-teaching remotely over the past several months.\n\nWhen half your class doesn't have their camera on â€” I was teaching 7-year-olds, 8-year-olds â€” you don't know if something is happening at home, we don't know if they're understanding because you can't really see them, Fox said.\n\nAll of Madelyn Fox's student teaching has been remote.\n\nIn addition, she didn't get as much of a chance as she would have liked to in-person practice classroom management because in a pandemic environment, all you have to do is mute them, Fox said. Still, Fox said she's learning new ways of managing a classroom through technology, like the aforementioned use of the mute button and monitoring chat features.\n\nDespite these obstacles, Fox said she's still motivated to become a teacher so that she can provide students with opportunities to engage with material in ways they haven't before. As a young student herself, Fox said she didn't learn to love reading and literature until she got to engage with plays. Now Fox is a creative writing minor. She said she wants to provide similar aha moments for her students.\n\nI want to see kids become themselves and learn that there are things beyond a grade that matter and that finding something you love to do within a classroom can help you in the future, she said.\n\nAnd learning to teach during the pandemic has left Fox well-prepared for a career in the profession, she said.\n\nNone of the current teachers have ever had this type of opportunity where they learn how to do it all online, she said, that makes my generation of future teachers quite impressive because it means that we have this learned knowledge that other teachers don't have.
U.S. stocks closed lower Friday, snapping a five-day streak that helped to drive the Dow and the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But major indexes posted robust gains for a third week in a row as the Federal Reserve reassured the market that it will remain flexible on interest rates going forward.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% fell 5.97 points to 23,995.95, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% slipped 0.38 point to 2,596.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index US:NQH9 shed 14.59 points, or 0.2%, to 6,971.48.\n\nFor the week, the Dow rose 2.4%, the S&P 500 gained 2.5%, and the Nasdaq rallied 3.5%.\n\nRead: This popular stock-market checklist from Citi says the bull is alive and well\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nAlthough stocks retreated, volatility receded as investors took solace in speeches by Federal Reserve officials this week as they continued to spread the message that the central bank will be cautious in its approach to raising interest rates this year.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell reinforced that message Thursday during a discussion at the Economic Club of Washington where he said that the central bank will be flexible and patient on the monetary policy.\n\nRead:The stock market just got off to its best start in 13 years\n\nLatest data showed muted inflation with the consumer-price index slipping 0.1% in December to mark the first decline in nine months, the Labor Department said Friday. That matched the forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch. The increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months slowed to 1.9% from 2.2%, the first time it's fallen below the key 2% mark since August 2017.\n\nInvestors may also have found a modicum of cheer on the U.S.-China trade front after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Thursday night that Vice Premier Liu He, the most senior economic policy adviser to President Xi Jinping, would travel to Washington later in January to continue trade negotiations, talks that have been seen by markets as gaining momentum this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the partial U.S. government shutdown entered its 21st day, tying the record for the longest in history. While markets have so far shrugged off the drama in Washington, hundreds of thousands of federal workers won't receive paychecks this week, and economists warn that the economic effects of the shutdown could grow significant as the standoff drags on.\n\nWhat were analysts saying?\n\nBrent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, told MarketWatch that weakness in equities Friday morning should not shake confidence in what he sees as a sustainable rally going forward.\n\nWe've clawed back from the December downturn, which was disconnected from economic reality, he said. With inflation not rising convincingly above 2%, markets are right to think that the Fed will be their friend, he said, adding that Friday's subdued inflation reading will give the central bank even more reason to take the patient approach Powell has outlined in recent speeches.\n\n\n\nStocks are loving that central bank policy appears to be in an ultra-dovish mode, wrote Edward Moya, chief market strategist at Oanda, in a note. Inflation is low and under control and the main catalyst for the Fed's ability to be patient. If we see softer prints, we could see yields drop and stocks continue their rally.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nShares of Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.73% rose 4% after the firm was upgraded to strong buy from outperform at Raymond James.\n\nChico's FAS Inc. CHS, +5.34% advanced 4.2% after the firm announced the closure of 250 stores, as part of an overhaul, with the aim of improving its online offering and customer service.\n\nActivision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, +0.76% fell 9.4% after the firm announced that it was ceding rights to the Destiny franchise to Bungie Inc. Following the move, Benchmark cut its price target on the stock from $93 to $87, and KeyBanc Capital slashed its price target from $80 to $64.\n\nShares of General Motors Co. GM, -1.42% rose 7.1% after the auto maker said it expects 2018 earnings and adjusted free cash flow to beat expectations and provided an upbeat 2019 outlook.\n\nYum Brands Inc. YUM, +0.75% is down 0.9% after the KFC and Pizza Hut parent was downgraded from neutral to sell by Goldman Sachs.\n\nShares of Starbucks Corp. SBUX, +2.24% also fell 0.7% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.\n\nHow were other markets trading?\n\nMarkets in Asia rallied with Japan's Nikkei NIK, +0.18% closing 1% higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.49% added 0.6% and China's Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.17% advanced 0.7%.\n\nIn Europe, stocks rose, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.88% edging up 0.1%.
Treasury prices came under selling pressure Wednesday, pushing yields to their highest level in weeks, as U.S. economic reports delivered signs of rising inflation.\n\nIn the latest U.S. inflation reading, the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3% in December, while core CPI, which excludes food and energy, added 0.2%. The index rose 2.1% overall in 2016, its fastest pace since 2011. Separately, industrial production climbed 0.8% in December, rising by the largest amount in two years.\n\nInflation topping 2% in 2016, a level viewed as the Federal Reserve's target for a healthy economy, might compel the central bank to increase rates at a rapid clip, in turn encouraging selling in Treasury notes. Investors tend to unload government bonds in the face of expectations of higher rates because they can repurchase richer-yielding Treasury notes later.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen during the afternoon said she expects interest rates to rise a few times per year until the end of 2019. Her comments at 3 p.m. Eastern followed the Fed's latest Beige Book of business conditions, which reinforced the view of rising inflation by showing pricing pressure had intensified somewhat in the last few weeks of 2016.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% rose 6.4 basis points to 2.391%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.455% rose 5.7 basis points to 2.987%, marking the biggest one-day yield gain for both the 10-year and the 30-year bonds since Dec. 9. Bond prices and yields move inversely.\n\nMeanwhile, the two-year yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.157% picked up 3.6 basis points to 1.172%, marking its largest one-day increase since Jan. 3, according to Dow Jones data.\n\nYields have been in a steady uptrend over the past six months, ever since the 10-year touched an all-time low around 1.36% in July, though the move accelerated after the November election of Trump, whose policies, include ramping up fiscal spending, are expected to stoke inflation. Rising inflation erodes the value of a bond's fixed payments. Typically, when inflation is on the rise, bond investors demand higher yields to compensate for the corrosive effect that higher prices have on real returns.\n\nIn general, we have a bearish bias towards Treasurys and expect a further selloff, said Marc-Henri Thoumin, rates strategist at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale. We expect inflation to keep rising, and think this will be the driver for the coming year.\n\nHowever, the gain in yields appears to have stalled of late, with a retreat under way from the recent high near 2.6% hit in mid-December.\n\nIn addition to the inflation data, investors also looked ahead to the European Central Bank's first policy meeting of 2017, which will occur on Thursday and could shed some light on European monetary policy in a year likely to be driven by geopolitical events.\n\nAt the ECB's last meeting, the central bank extended its bond-buying program by nine months, although it reduced the pace of its purchases beyond March. Any additional details on the political or monetary environment will be closely watched, especially as President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in as the U.S.'s 45th president on Friday.\n\nInvestors may be looking for more clarity on Trump's legislative priorities and policy details before establishing longer-term investment strategies.
Oil futures rallied by nearly 5% on Tuesday, with U.S. prices tapping highs above $50 for the first time since February 2020.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, together known as OPEC+, reached an agreement on production curbs starting in February, with Saudi Arabia voluntarily taking on a larger reduction.\n\nIn a news conference, Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said his country is willing to volunteer an additional production cut of 1 million barrels per day to bring its output to 8.125 million barrels per day starting on Feb. 1, to the end of March.\n\nThat means Saudi Arabia will carry a greater burden of the oil-output cuts in the next two months, as Russia and Kazakhstan are allowed to boost production by a combined 75,000 barrels a day.\n\nRead: In 'gesture of goodwill,' Saudi Arabia to cut more oil output as Russia, Kazakhstan bump up production\n\nOPEC+ had voted in December to relax output curbs by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.2 million barrels a day beginning on Jan. 1, and then to meet on a monthly basis to reassess market needs. The producers failed to come to a decision Monday over the production curbs, resulting in further talks Tuesday.\n\nRussia and Kazakhstan got away with increasing their output in February and March, while other OPEC members have to bite the bullet, said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, in emailed commentary.\n\nSaudi Arabia's offer to compensate and voluntarily cut production did not take an official form, he said. It was an offer that was probably meant to be blurry and subject to changes when it comes to the actual cuts when the time comes.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery CL.1, -0.62% CLG21 rose $2.31, or nearly 4.9%, to settle at $49.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after trading as high as $50.20.\n\nMarch Brent crude BRN00, -0.62% , the global benchmark, gained $2.51, or 4.9%, to $53.60 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\n\nPrices for both WTI and Brent, based on the most-active contracts, settled at their highest since February 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, away from the OPEC+ poker table, the oil market found a helping hand in the Middle East, where tensions are flaring again, said Tonhaugen.\n\nIran on Monday started enriching uranium up to 20% at an underground facility and seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIran seizing a tanker creates, again, instability in the region and questions are raised again over the reliability of the oil transport Gulf sea roads, Tonhaugen said. If the situation doesn't deescalate quickly, oil prices will benefit from the unpredictability.\n\nIran's decision to continue its uranium enrichment program is initially likely to rule out any possibility of U.S. sanctions being lifted in the near future by President-elect [Joe] Biden, meaning that Iran will not return to the export market for now, wrote analysts at Commerzbank, in a note.\n\nBack on Nymex, prices for petroleum products settled sharply higher along with oil. February gasoline RBG21 rose 5.8% to $1.4521 a gallon and February heating oil HOG21 added 3.9% to $1.5189 a gallon.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration will release its weekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies on Wednesday. Analysts at IHS Markit forecast a decline of 1.2 million barrels in crude supplies for the week ended Jan. 1. They also expect inventory increases of 1.4 million for gasoline and 2.2 million for distillates.\n\nNatural-gas futures climbed strongly Tuesday amid forecasts for some cooler weather in parts of the U.S. that may boost demand for the heating fuel.\n\nFebruary natural gas NGG21 rose 4.7% to $2.702 per million British thermal units following a rise of nearly 1.7% on Monday.
European stocks finished at their lowest in a week Thursday, as investors considered a signal from the European Central Bank that it's positioning for a more hawkish view on monetary policy.\n\nRetailers, meanwhile, struggled after the release of disappointing financial updates from the sector that included the key Christmas shopping period.\n\nHow did markets fare?\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.40% fell 0.3% to 397.25, its weakest finish since Jan. 4 and a second straight loss, according to FactSet data. The telecom, tech and consumer-services sectors lost the most, but commodity-related and financial shares were top gainers. On Wednesday, the pan-European index fell 0.4%, pulling back from a 2Â½-year high.\n\nGermany's DAX 30 index DAX, +1.23% declined 0.6% to end at 13,202.90, and France's CAC 40 PX1, +0.13% turned lower, finishing down by 0.3% at 5,488.55.\n\nThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.25% logged a record close by rising 0.2% to 7,762.94.

Yields rise when prices fall.\n\nWhat drove markets?\n\nStocks pulled back while the euro leapt against major rivals after minutes from the ECB's December meeting suggested policy makers may be poised to tweak their ultraloose monetary policy efforts, which have weighed on the shared currency.\n\nThe language pertaining to various dimensions of the monetary policy stance and forward guidance could be revisited early in the coming year, according to the minutes.\n\nReconsideration could take place if the eurozone economy continues to expand and if inflation keeps rising toward the bank's target around 2%, the minutes said.\n\nThe ECB, led by President Mario Draghi, in December confirmed its plan to halve its quantitative easing program to â‚¬30 billion starting this month, and to let it run until the end of September 2018 or beyond. The central bank meets next on Jan. 25.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of retail stocks were punished after trading updates, including Danish jeweler Pandora A/S and Britain's Marks & Spencer PLC.\n\nWhat strategists are saying?\n\nThe upbeat minutes from the ECB has prompted traders to be fearful that their loose monetary policy may be reined in sooner than traders expected. The Bank of Japan trimmed their bond buying scheme this week, and dealers are a bit wary the ECB may not be a lax as they initially let on, said CMC Markets analyst David Madden in a note.\n\n[D]espite the Eurozone's increasingly brisk growth rate, the ECB is still deeply concerned about inflation and the stubbornly low pace of wage rises. So for all the hawkish nods and winks in today's minutes, the QE money presses are still expected to keep turning until September, said John Dolan, senior dealer at Fexco Corporate Payments, in a note.\n\nThe euro has strengthened as markets adjust to this change of tone, and the stakes for Mario Draghi's next press conference have notched up as markets dare to hope that the ECB is finally ready to wean the eurozone economy off monetary stimulus, he said.\n\nStock movers: Pandora shares PNDORA, +4.12% tumbled 10.7%, their worst session since August, according to FactSet. The Danish jeweler said in its preliminary 2017 financial update Thursday that revenue was marginally below its initial financial guidance of 23 billion to 24 billion Danish kroner. It also said its Ebitda margin is expected to be 37.3%, versus its full-year guidance of 38%.\n\n[S]everal external factors have worked against us during 2017, including a difficult U.S. retail climate as well as an unfavorable currency development, said Pandora CEO Anders Colding Friis in a statement.\n\nMarks & Spencer PLC MKS, -1.64% MAKSY, -2.73% sank 7% after the British retailer and supermarket chain said like-for-like food sales declined in the 13 weeks to Christmas.\n\nTesco PLC TSCO, +0.18% TSCDY, -0.43% fell 4.3%. Britain's largest supermarket chain said it's confident in its outlook for fiscal 2018, after like-for-like U.K. sales rose 1.9% during the Christmas period. But slower sales of general merchandise and tobacco dragged on overall performance.\n\nSee: European stocks have been a trendy trade, but they now could finally break out\n\nRichemont SA shares CFR, +2.56% rose 0.6%, paring a larger gain. The Swiss owner of Cartier and other high-end jewelry brands said third-quarter revenue grew moderately, missing analyst forecasts.\n\nSAP SE SAP, -0.79% gave up 3.3% following a ratings downgrade by Morgan Stanley of the German software maker to equal-weight from overweight. Our checks have been mixed for 4Q and we see some risk of a bump in the road for S/4 HANA [platform] migration, wrote analyst Adam Wood in a research note.\n\nShares of Hexagon AB HEXA.B, +0.86% jumped 5.8% after reports late Wednesday said Ola RollÃ©n, the chief executive of the Swedish industrial-technology company, had been acquitted on insider-trading charges related to an outside investment.\n\nEconomic data: Eurozone industrial production jumped 1% in November, compared with expectations for a rise of 0.8%, according to FactSet. Output was up 3.2% on the year, Eurostat said.\n\nGermany's economy grew by 2.2% in 2017, according to a preliminary estimate from the country's Destatis agency. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal projected slightly higher growth of 2.3%.\n\nThe Bank of France raised its fourth-quarter growth forecast to 0.6% quarter-on-quarter from a previous forecast of 0.5%.
Think before you jump or, in this case, file.\n\nDivorce filings surge in January as people decide to start their New Year with a clean slate, helped by a stressful holiday period and, perhaps, even more stressful in-laws, experts say, with family lawyers reporting a rise of nearly one-third in business in the New Year. John Slowiaczek, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, says he typically sees a spike of 25% to 30% every year in January. Similar trends are seen in the U.K.: one in five couples plan to divorce after the holidays, according to one survey of 2,000 spouses by legal firm Irwin Mitchell.\n\n 'We don't encourage someone to open their spouse's mail. You can, however, look at the financial institution that sent the statement through the mail. If you give us those names, we can subpoena that information.'  â€” â€”John Slowiaczek, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers\n\nBeing cooped up in a house for several days when a marriage is experiencing serious problems â€” while dealing with the pressure to put on a happy face for the kids and visiting relatives â€” takes its toll on the most stoic of couples. Holiday time is usually a time when we get a spike in consultations and retentions, says Lois Liberman, a partner at the law firm Blank Rome in New York and chair of the company's matrimonial group. Holiday time is usually fraught with a lot of tension, emotion and financial issues, which is usually the trigger.\n\nDivorce can be one of the most financially devastating life events, so get an up-to-date assessment of your spouse's accounts. Opening someone else's mail is illegal, Slowiaczek says. You can, however, make a note of the financial institution that mails statements. If you give us those names, we can subpoena that information. (Most financial statements arrive between the 3rd and 8th of the month, he says, as they're usually mailed at the end of every month.) Accountant records are also a fertile ground for information on a spouse's financial affairs, he adds, and can also be subpoenaed.\n\nAlso see: 5 apps for spying on your spouse\n\nSlowiaczek is cautious about taking on clients who refer to him as a pit bull or a shark. Sometimes, people might say that because we're tough, he says, but if you go in with all guns blazing and start in a mean, aggressive manner, you automatically create a very adversarial situation. That could increase the cost of the divorce â€” which could vary between $25,000 to $100,000, depending on the assets involved, the lawyer's fees and where you live â€” by double or even triple, he says. Be courteous and respectful. The key is to avoid escalation.\n\n 'Don't rush to file. Think about your end game. Many people file quickly out of anger perhaps after learning of a spouse's misconduct. But it's better to be strategic.'  â€” â€” Randy Kessler, author of 'Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future'\n\nAnd no-one should make such any big financial decision when they are feeling tired and emotional, says Randy Kessler, an Atlanta-based lawyer who wrote the book, Divorce: Protect Yourself, Your Kids, and Your Future. Divorces, he adds, are one of the biggest financial decisions of your life. They're up there with getting married and buying a home. There's one big difference: They can be devastating for your finances, especially if your partner earned more money and the couple are forced to sell their home.\n\nDon't rush to file, Kessler says. Think about your end game. Many people file quickly out of anger perhaps after learning of a spouse's misconduct. But it's better to be strategic. Maybe wait until after your spouse gets his or her year-end bonus or pays for a nice Christmas present? Or, as the title character in the Netflix NFLX, -3.75% television drama Doctor Foster did, bide your time and locate all the financial records first, he adds, so your lawyer won't charge you thousands to subpoena them from your spouse's employer or banks. And, of course, so no-one can hide funds.\n\nIt may be that divorce is not the best option, particularly if one partner doesn't have company health insurance. Annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage reached $18,142 this year, up 3% on last year, with workers on average paying $5,277 towards their coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Menlo, Calif. Premiums for Obamacare, which president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal, are expected to rise 22% next year for the benchmark silver plan. Some health insurers won't insure both parties on the same policy if the couple has legally separated, Slowiaczek says.\n\nDon't miss: Why some American couples stay married\n\nAnd find out whether or not you live in a community (or marital) property state. Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico and Washington treat all marital assets as community or marital property, meaning assets acquired during the marriage are divided equally when a couple divorces. In other equitable distribution states, assets are divided based on a variety of factors, including the income of each party at the time of marriage, duration of the marriage, loss of benefits, needs of the custodial parent and probable future financial circumstances.\n\nAnd don't serve your partner with divorce papers during the holidays, especially if you have children. As they grow older they'll hate that holiday forever, Liberman says. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do some preparation in the meantime. In New York, you can file for divorce and you have 120 days before you serve them. Most unhappy spouses wait until after the turkey has been carved and gifts have been unwrapped, she adds, regardless of how challenging the holidays have been. Nor is it a good time to get divorced just before your daughter's wedding or son's graduation.\n\nThis may also give the partner filing for divorce time to seek out a good lawyer, but perhaps not one already associated with the family. There's need to hire the first lawyer you hear about, Kessler says. Lawyers have different styles. Just because a lawyer says he or she is a divorce lawyer doesn't make them the divorce lawyer that's best for you. Think about interviewing a few and see which one you feel the most comfortable with. Which one listens to you the best? Which one is more likely to help do what you want, not what they presume you want?
Many Americans nearing their golden years are nervous about paying for health insurance in the coming years, according to a new survey.\n\nRetirement is supposed to be a time for leisure and freedom, but Thursday's findings from the University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging show that some who are about to enter the next stage of life are chained to worries about essential costs.\n\nAnd pollsters noted they did their work even before a high-stakes decision from a Texas federal judge declaring the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional, a ruling that could jeopardize health coverage for tens of millions.\n\nThe study found:\n\nÂ· 45% of the 1,024 polled participants, aged 50 to 64, said they had slim confidence, if any, that they could pay for health insurance when they retire â€” and 27% were unsure they'd even afford coverage over the next year.\n\nÂ· 68% said they were concerned how federal government policy might affect their health coverage.\n\nÂ· One in four participants said they weren't sure how to determine if their plan covered particular services and how much those services would cost out of pocket.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the participants had coverage through their employer or someone else's work. Another 20% had coverage through a form of government-provided insurance and 8% bought their own health insurance, the poll said.\n\nThe pollsters intentionally focused on people aged 50 to 64, because 65 is the year when most Americans become eligible for Medicare health insurance. 59 million senior citizens and younger adults with permanent disabilities have coverage through the program but it doesn't cover a number of costs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nMore than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries shelled out at least 20% of the income on out-of-pocket health care costs. The number of Medicare recipients spending at least 20% of their income on out-of-pocket costs is estimated to grow in the coming years, the organization said.\n\nWith all that anxiety about insurance, many of the participants from the recently-released national poll said they kept close tabs on news about the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nResearchers gathered their data prior to a ruling last month from Judge Reed O'Connor. The U.S. District Court Judge agreed with arguments of 20 Republican-leaning states that the Affordable Care Act was unconstitutional without its penalty for not having insurance.\n\nAttorneys General from 16 states are appealing O'Connor's decision. The case could make it all the way up to for a Supreme Court ruling â€” but that could only happen by next year at the earliest.\n\nThough O'Connor struck down the Affordable Care Act, he recently ruled that his decision wouldn't take effect during the case's appeal. Many everyday Americans would otherwise face great uncertainty, the judge wrote.\n\nThe AARP and Michigan Medicine, the University of Michigan's academic medical center, sponsored the poll.\n\nAlison Bryant, senior vice president of research at AARP, said the findings reaffirmed the point that health care was a key issue for older Americans. Though Bryant noted the uninsured rate for 50- to 64-year-olds plummeted 47% after the Affordable Care Act took effect, we have to continue to improve access and affordability of health coverage for all older adults.
Shares of Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% shed 0.5% in morning trade Wednesday, after UBS did an about-face on the banking giant, flipping to bearish from bullish, amid concerns over how new protectionist policies may affect Citigroup's global franchise. Analyst Saul Martinez gave the stock a rare sell rating, after it was at buy for nearly three years. He cut the stock price target to $58, which is 3.2% below current levels, from $64. Only 15% of companies covered by Citigroup have sell ratings. Citigroup's global franchise is generally a good thing, but it also leaves the company less levered to lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates in the U.S., and more exposed to risks associated with the President-elect's protectionist policy stances, Martinez wrote in a note to clients. He said an underperforming Mexican franchise and Asia consumer businesses in slower growth markets also dampen his view. The stock has soared 20% since the election, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.52% has climbed 18% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 6%.
In one of the last interviews he gave before his death Wednesday, Jack Bogle was heard telling investors to play it safe.\n\nThere was no sky-is-falling talk from the godfather of low-cost index funds, but his advice to get in your comfort zone over stock exposure interview was prudent, given that it came just days after a holiday meltdown for stocks.\n\nOpinion:Jack Bogle gave individual investors the power to triumph over Wall Street\n\nHe also mentioned clouds on the horizon, with trade tensions among them, and that old saw is threatening to make a mess of the action Thursday. Reports U.S. feds are probing Huawei over alleged stolen tech secrets have forced some cheer out of the building, with the safe-haven yen USDJPY, +0.11% seeing some duck-for-cover action.\n\nAs well, there may be just too much idle market time between Morgan Stanley results and Netflix after the bell today.\n\nBack to Bogle, who haunts our call of the day from Andrew Lapthorne on SociÃ©tÃ© GLE, -0.94% quantitative analysis team. The analyst warns that U.S. small-caps will be in the eye of the next storm for stocks, owing to the huge amount of debt they've been racking up for years. Corporate debt was another horizontal cloud mentioned by the Bogle.\n\nBanks like SocGen have been banging the table on this one, Lapthorne said in a phone interview, adding that he's personally had the subject on the radar for four years. His fresh warning came up in a recent presentation to clients given by he and the bank's uber-bearish strategist Albert Edwards. In a clutch of charts, they rolled out this one showing a huge ramp-up in debt for the small-cap focused Russell 2000 RUT, -1.72% :\n\nSmall-caps have traditionally acted as a canary in the coal mine for the larger market, as they tend to be more sensitive to growth worries and usually show signs of fatigue before their big-cap counterparts.\n\nU.S. small-caps have been taking on a massive amount of leverage over the last few years, particularly starting in 2013 during the QE years, notes Lapthorne.\n\nPeople focusing on buybacks were missing the fact that actually a lot of [companies] buying back significant market cap was going on in the small cap-index. The highly unusual reason that was happening is because people were having to lend to real businesses, he said.\n\nRead:Head of world's largest asset manager says stock market has hit a bottom â€” but this would make it surge\n\nSo, the difference between where we are now versus 12 months ago, says Lapthorne, is that share prices have been losing ground, and if you have leverage and your share price is weak, that compounds the problem. On a 12-month basis, the Russell 2000 has lost nearly 8% against a 5.7% drop for the S&P 500.\n\nAnd a small company with balance-sheet problems can't do what the big boys do â€” go back to markets and do a rights issue. That ultimately leads to a higher bankruptcy risk and bigger risks for the economy, which gets harder to ignore. Looking at the Fed's reversal in policy it seems far more connected to what's going on in credit markets and in terms of weakening companies, he said.\n\nLapthorne says it doesn't make sense that investors focus on bigger companies when it comes to looking for red flags for the overall market. If you think about it, the S&P 500 contains some of the richest, best companies in the world, so why would you look to the richest companies in the world for signs of stress? You're far better off looking at the poorest companies.\n\nHe also worries that investors are on a path of companies that are going to really struggle owing to big deterioration in profit growth, which is now seeing the effects of a tax-induce surge of a year ago start to fade.\n\nHere's one last chart from SocGen that taps into another worry on the radar for investors â€” a recession threat. It shows that one in four U.S. stocks have 50% or more of their value erased in a recession:\n\nGulp.\n\nRead: Why stock-market investors may soon need to worry about the government shutdown\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.39% , S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.09% have all opened on the downside.\n\nAs global equities dip, crude US:CLU8 is getting knocked, while the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% is flat, gold US:GCU8 is steady.\n\nWeak results from Morgan Stanley MS, -1.57% and SocGen have hit Europe stocks SXXP, +0.88% , while trade jitters dragged Asia stocks south HSI, +0.49% .\n\nThe chart\n\nHow can you resist stocks right now?

Who says you have to be an energy drink to advertise like one?\n\nCanada Dry, part of the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. portfolio of brands, is making a push with the sporting crowd as the popularity of energy drinks grows among consumers. But it's not actually launching a new energy drink.\n\nThe ginger ale brand has previously pushed a message about relaxation in ads focused on the drink's ginger-farm roots. It's now turning to scenes from the gym for its latest spots, which will debut Monday on ESPN and NBC Sports. But the ads still hang on to their relaxation theme.\n\nConsumers are increasingly turning away from traditional carbonated drinks and toward beverages like energy drinks. Cowen & Company analysts suggested last month that Coca Cola Co. KO, -1.31% acquire the remaining stake in Monster Beverage Corp. MNST, -0.77% in order to take full advantage of this trend.\n\nWhile consumers are clearly showing increased concern over sugar consumption, the consumer has not rejected sugary beverages outright as we consistently see outsized growth for sugar beverage categories that also offer consumers a functional benefit to help justify that sugary beverage occasion, analysts wrote in a note.\n\nRead also:It's time to sell Coke and P&G stocks, Goldman says\n\nThe new ad also comes on the heels of an upgrade of Dr. Pepper Snapple US:DPS by Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile in general we do not favor large companies buying into growth, we believe the recently announced acquisition of Bai, should it close on announced terms, is a strategic fit that could bolster Dr. Pepper Snapple's sales growth and de-risk a potential distribution loss that could occur if Bai is sold to another company, the Monday note said.\n\nBai is a line of antioxidant beverages made with smart sweeteners like those from the Stevia leaf.\n\nAnalysts also believe that Dr. Pepper Snapple is well-positioned if tax policies change.\n\n[I]n the even broader tax policy changes occur as currently proposed, Dr. Pepper Snapple would be a relative beneficiary given its current high tax rate (35%), limited mismatch from a destination-based tax perspective, and low likelihood of sizeable incremental debt post the announced Bai acquisition, the note said.
Happy New Year, Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tesla TSLA, +3.68% and SpaceX founder passed Amazon's AMZN, +1.42% Jeff Bezos on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to become the richest person in the world on Thursday morning, Bloomberg reported, as a 4.8% rise in Telsa shares pushed Musk's fortune to $188.5 billion at 10:15 a.m. Eastern, which was $1.5 billion more than Bezos's $187 billion.\n\nHow did Musk, 49, respond to the news that he passed one of his top rivals and became the wealthiest in the world?\n\nHow strange, he tweeted. Well, back to workâ€¦\n\nIndeed, the outspoken entrepreneur has been on quite a ride over the past year as his net worth has skyrocketed by more than $150 billion in what might be the fastest rise in wealth creation in history.\n\nA year ago, Musk was worth about $27 billion, and barely cracked Bloomberg's list of the 50 richest people. But Tesla saw its shares spike more than 700% last year, and the company joined the S&P 500 in December following five quarters of positive earnings.\n\nWhile the pandemic took millions of livelihoods and tens of thousands of lives across the globe last year, many of the world's wealthiest people managed to get richer. The 500 richest people in the world added a record $1.8 trillion to their combined net worth last year. And the Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies reported that the 651 U.S. billionaires saw their collective wealth grow by more than $1 trillion over nine months.\n\nRead:Here's the case for Elon Musk, Warren Buffett and the rest of America's billionaires sending $3,000 stimulus checks to everybody\n\nBloomberg notes that Bezos, who had been the world's richest person since 2017, would still hold a sizable lead over Musk if it weren't for his divorce from MacKenzie Scott in 2019, which gave his ex-wife 25% of his Amazon stake. What's more, Bezos also donated Amazon shares worth about $680 million in November.
U.S. Treasury yields barely budged Tuesday, with action in U.S. government bonds pausing a day ahead of a news conference by President-elect Donald Trump, which could offer specifics about his plan for the U.S. economy.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% rose 0.2 basis point to 2.379%, while the yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.455% finished unchanged at 2.971%. Meanwhile, the two-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.157% , rose 0.4 basis point to 1.172%. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices.\n\nTreasury yields have been mostly climbing since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, a victory that has stirred hope that campaign promises touting fiscal stimulus, regulatory rollbacks and tax cuts, could be realized and rev up the domestic economy. That hope has pushed inflation expectations higher and ratcheted up forecasts for interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\n\nHigher inflation and anticipation of Fed hiking have underpinned selling in bonds, lifting yields from a low in July of 1.36% to a high last month of about 2.6%. A plot of projections for future rate hikes by Fed members released last month, implies three rate increases in 2017.\n\nCheck out: Goldman's Hatzius: Investors could get blindsided by a cluster of Fed hikes this year\n\nBut the main spark for Treasurys moves has been the coming presidential administration.\n\nRead:Gross says this key bond level is a far bigger deal than Dow 20,000\n\nIan Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said any focus on fiscal stimulus would spur renewed reflation jitters,'' which would hurt the bond market. Reflation refers to the risk of higher inflation, which can erode the value of a bond's fixed-income payments.\n\nThe recent selloff in Treasurys, and the accompany rally in risk assets like stocks and crude oil, has moderated somewhat as Wall Street awaits further details on Trump's policy proposals and weigh its potential impact on the overall economy. Trump's inauguration is set for Jan. 20.\n\nThe first Treasury-note auction of 2017â€”a sale of $24 billion three-year notesâ€”saw the strongest demand since August, with bids exceeding supply 2.97 times. The sale produced a yield of 1.472%, the highest for a three-year auction since 2010.\n\nThe stats are solid, but strong 3-year note auctions are really the norm as opposed to what we saw over the prior two months, said Thomas Simons, analyst at Jefferies, in a note.\n\nMeanwhile, the yield on the 10-year German bond TMBMKDE-10Y, -0.259% , known as the bund, was at 0.282% on Tuesday.\n\nâ€”Min Zeng contributed to this article
So far, so very good.\n\nLast year was a historic one for equity marketsâ€”with global stocks not recording a single down month and U.S. indexes hitting a record number of recordsâ€”and while the new year is young, so far it seems to be extending 2017's upward trend.\n\nTuesday marks the 10th trading day of 2018, and market returns over that period stand to be the best in 15 years. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up 4.3% over that 10-session period, while the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% is up 3.9% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% has gained 4.6%.\n\nAccording to the WSJ Market Data Group, that represents the best 10-day start to a year for both the Dow and the S&P since 2003, when the Dow kicked off the year by rising 4.57% and the S&P rose 4.36%. For the Nasdaq, 2018 marks the best 10-day start since 2012, when it rose 4.72%.\n\nA turn lower on Tuesday weakened the trio's performance on the year. At its peak of the day, both the Dow and the S&P were on track for their best 10-day start since 1987.\n\nThe gains have almost literally been nonstop. Of the 10 trading days in 2018 thus far, both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have risen in eight of them, while the Dow has gained in seven of the 10 days. All three have hit repeated records and powered through multiple milestones; the Dow topped 26,000 for the first time ever on Tuesday, though it subsequently retreated from that level and ended in negative territory for the day.\n\nRelated:Stock performance in Trump's first year was second only to FDR\n\nDespite many market analysts warning about valuations and what they see as excessive optimism, U.S. stocks have been almost completely bereft of volatility or pullbacks. The S&P is poised to go an unprecedented length of time without declining 5% from a peak, something that is typically quite common.\n\nSee:Bets on falling volatility now 'most crowded trade': fund managers\n\nEnergy and consumer discretionary stocks have been the biggest outperformers of the year so far, with both sectors up nearly 6%. Broadly, markets have been supported by improving economic data and an accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The recently passed tax bill, which will cut corporate-tax rates, has also been cited as a tailwind driving markets. Separately, corporate earnings have been strong both in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nPast years when stocks have gotten off to such a strong start have typically coincided with steep gains for the market overall. However, kicking January off with a rally hardly guarantees a smooth ride upward, and there may be no more dramatic illustration of this than 1987. While that year started with big gains, it was also the year of Black Monday, the Oct. 19 crash where 23% of market value was wiped out in a single session. However, the S&P still ended up 2% on the year in 1987.\n\nRead more:Why ETFs won't cause, or worsen, a 1987-style crash
The Federal Reserve may be in a better position to reduce the size of its balance sheet now that it has raised interest rates twice in the past year, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said Thursday.\n\nIn a speech to the Forecasters Club of New York, Bullard said the Fed may be able to use its balance sheet as a way to tighten monetary policy without putting exclusive emphasis on higher interest rates.\n\nThe Fed has amassed a $4.5 billion balance sheet since the 2008-2009 financial crisis as part of its innovative and controversial purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities in an effort to push long-term interest rates lower.\n\nThe Fed has been holding the balance sheet steady by reinvesting maturing proceeds from its holdings.\n\nThe first step to reduce the balance sheet would be to end reinvestment.\n\nIn his speech, Bullard noted that the Fed has not set a timetable for ending the current reinvestment policy.\n\nThe issue of the Fed's balance sheet is getting more attention this month. Fed officials have penciled in three rate hikes this year.\n\nSee:Fed's Harker backs three interest-rate hikes this year\n\nMinutes of the Fed's December meeting show a discussion about the balance sheet policy and whether it need to be reviewed.\n\nRead:Fed officials show central bank might have to raise interest rates at a faster-than-gradual pace\n\nChairwoman Janet Yellen has said that the Fed would hold the balance sheet steady until the process of normalizing the federal funds rate is well underway.\n\nBut in an interview with Reuters earlier this week, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said the Fed should consider trimming the balance sheet. He said it might be a way to allow long-term rates to rise without pushing up the dollar.\n\nAnd Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker told reporters that the Fed should start serious consideration of stopping reinvestment and unwinding the balance sheet, Reuters said.
Shares of Ford Motor Co. F, -5.38% fell 0.6% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the automaker reported preliminary 2018 earnings that were below expectations, and outlined its plan for a global redesign of its vehicle lineup. The company said 2018 earnings per share was 92 cents, compared with $1.90 a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, Ford said adjusted 2018 EPS was $1.30, below the FactSet consensus of $1.33. Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said the external challenges the company faced included commodity costs, unfavorable currency exchange effects, policy changes, a decline of business in China and higher warranty costs in North America. As part of its plan to redesign its lineup, Ford said it will refresh 75% of its lineup in North America over the next 24 months, including increasing the mix of its SUVs and fortifying its truck franchise. In addition, Ford said it will introduce 10 new Ford and Lincoln products in China this year, and more than 30 products by 2021. We are bolstering our portfolio to capture a healthy share of higher growth and higher profit segments and partnering where appropriate to improve profitability and returns, said Jim Farley, president of global markets. Ford's stock has gained 0.5% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has lost 7.1%.
European stocks finished lower Monday, weighed as the euro continued to march up further into three-year highs, giving a key regional benchmark its third drop in four sessions.\n\nInvestors were also watching for developments from the U.K., where construction and outsourcing heavyweight Carillion PLC has collapsed.\n\nHow markets are moving\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.40% fell 0.2% to end at 397.83, erasing part of last week's rise rise of 0.3%.\n\nIn Frankfurt on Monday, the DAX 30 index DAX, +1.23% lost 0.3% to end at 13,200.51, and France's CAC 40 PX1, +0.13% gave up 0.1% at 5,509.69.\n\nThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.25% was off 0.1% at 7,769.14 after Friday's record closing high.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.03% bought $1.2274, rising from 1.2200 late Friday in New York.\n\nWhat's driving markets\n\nMost European benchmark were stuck in the red while the euro headed toward $1.2300, a level that hasn't been seen since December 2014, according to FactSet data. A stronger euro can make products produced by European exporters more expensive for their overseas customers to purchase.\n\nThe euro began its leap last week after minutes from the European Central Bank's meeting in December suggested the bank may take a more hawkish stance on its monetary policy.\n\nWhile rate-hike speculation has ramped up, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who tends to be on the hawkish side of ECB policy, said imminent risk of a change is small for the moment, a Reuters report quoted him as saying in Germany late Friday. The ECB will next meet on Jan. 25.\n\nAlso kicking off Monday trade was news that Carillion CLLN, -28.95% will enter liquidation after crisis talks failed over the weekend. The construction giant, which also runs public services at prisons, hospitals and schools, couldn't work out a deal with the government and its creditors. Carillion employs 20,000 in the U.K. and uses thousands of subcontractors. Its shares have been halted.\n\nRead more:Carillion's collapse delivers a boost for shares of rivals\n\nWhat strategists are saying\n\nThe ECB's [minutes] was indeed upbeat but was also clear that inflation continued to undershoot, and that is was committed to the sequence of finishing asset purchases and then, after some time, lifting rates, said currency strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman in a Monday note.\n\nIf anything, the strong euro will dampen inflation pressures and squeeze earnings. Anglo-American companies are more likely to pass along currency developments to customers, while Continental and Japanese businesses appear to put more emphasis on market share than short-term profitability are less likely, they said. The euro's 2.5% appreciation on a trade-weighted basis is tantamount to a 40 basis points tightening of monetary policy.\n\nStock movers\n\nMetso Oyj FI:METSO fell 9.8% as the Finnish engineering company warned that fourth-quarter 2017 profitability of its minerals segment will be weaker than expected, due to a higher-than-estimated share of equipment sales compared to services sales and a weak margin of the services business. Metso said overall fourth-quarter sales are set to rise 5% from a year ago, to â‚¬710 million.\n\nShares in Carillion's rivals were mixed. G4S PLC GFS, +0.04% rose 1.1% while Balfour Beatty PLC BBY, +1.15% turned lower, losing 3.3%, as the company said it will take a hit of 35 million to 45 million pounds ($48 million to $62 million) from Carillion's liquidation.\n\nMeanwhile, Banco Santander PLC SAN, +2.02% was off 0.3%. The Spanish lender is set to be hurt by Carillion's collapse as Santander's U.K. branch is one of the company's principal creditors, business daily Expansion reported, citing unnamed sources in the sector.\n\nGKN UK:GKN rose 4.1% for one of the Stoxx 600's biggest gains, after reports that U.S.-based private equity firm Carlyle is considering a bid for the U.K. engineering group. Meanwhile, Melrose Industries PLC MRO, -1.38% , whose takeover bid was recently rejected by GKN, said Monday it will start holding a series of meetings with shareholders to discuss the proposal. Melrose shares closed 1.4% higher.
A sudden, sharp decline by the yuan this week appeared to have far-reaching consequences for global equity markets, as indexes from Asia to North America post serious losses.\n\nFor yuan traded in China's onshore market, it's been the largest period of decline since Chinese officials surprised investors by announcing a surprise devaluation in mid-August. The decision had a similarly turbulent impact on global markets.\n\nRead: Dow kicks off 2016 with 400-point plunge on China fears\n\nMany market strategists believe the August devaluation convinced the Federal Reserve to delay its first interest-rate increase in nearly a decade.\n\nNow, with the dollar widely expected to continue rising as the Fed raises rates this year, market strategists are waiting for the other shoe to drop. They're bracing for further devaluation of the yuan, and the global market turmoil they suspect might follow.\n\nHere are a couple of factors that might affect the yuan's valuation over the next 12 months.\n\nPolicy makers loosen their grip\n\nLate last year, Chinese policy makers announced they would begin publishing the yuan's valuation relative to three new currency baskets, including one that was trade-weighted.\n\nThis led to speculation that China might soon announce another change in how it manages the yuan's exchange rate. Instead of using the dollar as its sole reference, officials could begin using the trade-weighted basket to set the yuan's daily reference rate, market strategists speculated.\n\nI think everybody's on alert that if the dollar rises substantially further, there's a good chance that [the PBOC] would change the mechanism or let the [yuan] go, said Greg Anderson, global head of currency strategy at BMO Capital Markets.\n\nRead: Why China may want its yuan to be more like the Singapore dollar\n\nSuch a change would likely help the yuan to gradually weaken, sparing investors from the global market turmoil that followed its sudden devaluation in August.\n\nThe China carry trade unwinds\n\nChina's enormous current-account surplus increased in 2015 as falling commodity prices cheapened the total value of the raw materials imported by Chinese manufacturers.\n\nBut in the second half of the year, its capital accountâ€”a measure of money moving into and out of an economyâ€”actually turned negative, and its foreign currency reserve declined.\n\nBecause the capital account reflects the flow of money across borders, it's likely that the yuan will continue to move in the same direction as the capital account, Anderson said.\n\nNicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the declines in both China's capital account and its foreign currency reserves have been driven by traders quickly unwinding bets that the yuan would continue to strengthen, following the yuan's August devaluation.\n\nThe question that's the most interesting is: What share, roughly speaking, of the carry trades that were in place last summer have now been unwound?, Lardy said.\n\nOnshore yuan USDCNY, +0.07% finished Monday's session at 6.53 to the dollar, while its offshore CNYCNH, +0.24% counterpart traded at 6.76. It was at 6.49, and 6.77 a session earlier, according to data from FactSet.\n\nOne currency, two exchange rates\n\nIt's very likely that if the dollar continues to strengthen, Chinese policy makers will take steps to drive their currency lower, though the People's Bank of China prefers to gradually implement policy changes.\n\nBut it isn't just policy makers who want a weaker currency; yuan traders also believe the currency is overvalued at the onshore rate.\n\nProof of this can be seen in the gap between the yuan's onshore and offshore exchange rates, which has seldom been wider than it is right now, as the chart below illustrates.\n\nAs they prepare for the yuan's inclusion in the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights basket, traders and market strategists expect Chinese policy makers to loosen their grip on the currency. Many hope that someday the onshore rate will be eliminated as controls on the currency are abandoned.\n\nEspecially in light of the discouraging data released over the past week, allowing the onshore rate to move closer to its offshore sibling might help boost growth in the country's slowing economy.
U.K. stocks finished higher Wednesday, keying off gains in most Asian markets after Chinese data wasn't as bad as feared.\n\nThe U.K's FTSE 100 UKX, +0.03% rose 0.5% to end at 5,960.97.\n\nAmong top London movers, oil major BP PLC UK:BLT BHP, -0.52% BHP, -0.82% popped nearly 4% higher, and mining heavyweight Rio Tinto PLC RIO, +1.79% RIO, +0.01% RIO, -0.89% advanced 1.9%.\n\nThe moves for the commodity groups came after Chinese customs data showed exports rose last month, in yuan terms. In dollar terms, exports fell 1.4% from a year earlier, better than an expected 8% decline forecast by 15 economists. The trade data showed Chinese crude imports surged 9.3% in December.\n\nMost Asian stock indexes finished higher in the wake of the data, with the Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.28% ending up 2.6% and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +1.01% tacking on 2.9%. But the Shanghai Composite Index suffered a late-day fall to close below 3,000 for the first time since its August slump.\n\nFinally some risk appetite is returning to Asian markets, said Simon Smith, chief economist at FxPro, in a note.\n\nFour Takeaways From Obama's Final State of the Union\n\nOverall for markets, China is likely to remain a dominant force in 2016, more so than in the past as the world's second-largest economy continues to slow, meaning this return of risk appetite we've seen so far this week may be temporary, he said.\n\nWorries about China slowdown and the impact it may have on demand for commodities has cut into the performance of the FTSE 100, which is down 4.5% so far this year.\n\nOff the FTSE 100, Premier Oil PLC PMO, -3.85% said Wednesday trading of its shares have been temporarily suspended pending an announcement of a potential acquisition of assets. The company later said it plans to pay $120 million for German power utility E. ON SE's EOAN, -0.98% EOAN, -0.32% U.K. North Sea assets.
The U.S. Department of Labor finalized a rule Wednesday that could be a boon to app-based gig companies while potentially costing American workers billions of dollars in lost wages and benefits.\n\nThe rule establishes a test for determining independent contractor status under the Federal Labor Standards Act, giving more weight to two of five factors, which critics say are favorable to gig companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. UBER and Lyft Inc. LYFT: the nature and degree of the worker's control over the work, and the worker's opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment. The other factors are skill, permanence of the working relationship and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production.\n\nThis rule brings long-needed clarity for American workers and employers, U.S. Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia said in a statement.\n\nThe rule was proposed in September and its comment period was shortened to 30 days instead of 60 days, in what critics said was the Trump administration's effort to rush it through before the end of his term. It is expected to go into effect March 8, the Labor Department said in a news release.\n\nThe proposal received 1,825 comments, including from the Economic Policy Institute, which estimates that the rule will cost workers â€” from delivery and transportation workers to those who work at call centers, in agriculture, home health care and elsewhere â€” at least $3.7 billion a year in pay and benefits.\n\nThis loss to workers is composed of at least $400 million in new annual paperwork costs, and a transfer to employers of at least $3.3 billion in the form of reduced compensation, wrote Heidi Shierholz, EPI's senior economist and director of policy. Further, social insurance funds would lose at least $750 million annually in the form of reduced employer contributions, meaning this rule also results in a transfer of at least $750 million annually from social insurance funds to employers.\n\nTwo dozen state attorneys general and officials from New York City, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia asked the Labor Department to withdraw the rule, while business groups and chambers of commerce supported the rule change.\n\nOpponents are optimistic that President-elect Biden's incoming administration could stop the rule from taking effect and eventually rescind it. Biden has expressed support for different criteria for determining worker classification, the so-called ABC test, which is law in California but not for gig companies, which successfully backed a ballot measure to exempt them from the law in November.\n\nFor more: Uber and Lyft win fight to keep drivers as contractors instead of employees in California\n\n[The Biden administration] will want their own rule, but would need to open that to public comment and of course that would take some time, said John Logan, professor at San Francisco State University's Labor and Employment Studies Department.\n\nAmong those that would benefit are Uber, Lyft and other gig companies, which have faced challenges around the nation over their treatment of drivers and delivery workers as contractors.\n\nNicole Moore, a Los Angeles-based organizer with Rideshare Drivers United, said: Let's be clear. Taking labor rights away from app-based workers is the agenda of the Trump administration that has never had frontline workers' interests in mind. But this is not in concrete and the new administration has the power to usher in a better future for all workers.\n\nWe appreciate the efforts made to modernize our nation's laws and look forward to working with policymakers to further this vision, Uber head of federal affairs Danielle Burr said in a statement.\n\nThe incoming Biden administration has not returned a request for comment. Lyft has not returned a request for comment.
Your emotional support animal in training may not get to fly business class anymore.\n\nOr any other class, for that matter.\n\nUnited Airlines UAL, -1.85% is changing its policies regarding emotional-support animals, banning animals under the age of four months from the cabin, to further ensure the well-being of our employees and customers while accommodating passengers with disabilities, the company said in a blog post on Thursday.\n\nThis is just another move in a long line of moves to restrict pets on air crafts, Christopher Elliott, founder of consumer advocacy organization Elliott.org, said. Animals could go the way of peanuts on planes at some point in the future â€” ideally airlines do not want to have any animals in the cabin.\n\n 'Animals could go the way of peanuts on planes at some point in the future.'  â€” â€”Christopher Elliott, consumer advocate\n\nThe new policy will go into effect on Jan. 7 and comes weeks after Delta Air Lines DAL, -3.14% made a similar change. Animals under the age of four months typically have not received the necessary vaccinations that help ensure the safety of our employees and customers, United said. The airline did not respond to request for additional comment.\n\nUnited will also limit animals allowed on flights, banning all emotional- support animals that are not dogs and cats. Service animals, which unlike emotional support animals are trained to assist a qualified person with a disability, are still accepted on flights as long as they are a dog, cat, or miniature horse, the new policy said.\n\nThis comes after United turned away one passenger in January 2018 for attempting to board with her emotional support peacock, for whom she had purchased a ticket.\n\n When people think of pets as children, they will do anything to fly with them.  â€” â€”Christopher Elliott, consumer advocate\n\nThe number of animals in the cabin has been on the rise in recent months, despite the fact that Delta DAL, -3.14% , American AAL, -2.78% and United UAL, -1.85% Airlines have tightened paperwork requirements on emotional support animals. Most service animals, which are trained to assist a qualified person with a disability, are still accepted on flights\n\nDelta said it had six biting incidents in a period of two months in early 2018 and the number of animal incidents on planes, ranging from urination to barking and biting, has increased 84% since 2016, Delta chief operating officer Gil West told The Wall Street Journal in August.\n\nThe airline carries an average of 700 emotional-support animals per day on flights, up from 450 a day in 2016, West said.\n\nDelta banned pit bull dogs from flights in July 2018 after a dog scratched a flight attendant, and United Airlines banned dozens of breeds of dogs from flights in May 2018, including Bulldogs, Boston Terriers, all kinds of Pugs and Boxers, Shih-Tzus, Mastiffs, American Bully, Pit Bulls, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Pekingese. Many of these breeds have been found to suffer respiratory problems on flights.\n\nElliott said the rise in animal passengers reflects a larger shift in how people view their pets â€” one airlines are struggling to combat.\n\nThe role pets play in society has really shifted in the past couple years, he said. When people think of pets as children, they will do anything to fly with them. But pets should really stay at home.
Growing tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran fueled volatile trading on Monday, with oil prices ultimately finishing lower as traders worried that an unstable political situation in the Middle East would complicate the outlook for oil in 2016.\n\nFebruary West Texas Intermediate crude CLG26, +0.10% shed 28 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $36.76 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It traded as high as $38.39 and as low as $36.33. February Brent crude UK:LCOG6 settled down 6 cents, or 0.2%, to $37.22 a barrel on London's ICE Futures exchange, reversing course after an earlier high of $38.99.\n\nRead:Traders fret Saudi Arabia-Iran conflict may result in fresh flood of oil\n\nSaudi Arabia on Sunday severed diplomatic ties with Iran, a fellow member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Saudi move came as hundreds of Iranians protested against the kingdom's Saturday execution of Nemer al-Nemer, a prominent Shiite cleric.\n\nIf the situation becomes more forceful between the two countriesâ€”Saudi Arabia and Iranâ€”it could bring an enormous spike for the oil price, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade.\n\nBut overall, the tension between two major producers is adding to the unpredictability of oil prices, which slumped to multiyear lows in 2015 amid a supply glut. Expectations for more barrels coming on stream from Iran this year were a key factor in oil's tumble, after an international agreement over its nuclear program paved the way for an expected end this year to Western sanctions on buying its oil.\n\nNothing has changed fundamentally, and global oil producers are going to continue pumping near max capacity for the foreseeable future ... and as a result, likely keep a lid on prices near $40 a barrel, said Tyler Richey, co-editor for The 7:00's Report.\n\nSee also:Saudi Arabia-Iran rift could further disrupt oil prices\n\nIt still remains unlikely for Saudi Arabia and Iran, among the five biggest OPEC oil producers, to go to war against each other, which is really the only way this political 'flare up' would materially push prices higher, potentially toward $50 or more, Richey said.\n\nSaudi Arabia executes prominent Shiite cleric\n\nStill, an escalation of tensions between two of the Middle East's key regional powers could delay a further slide in prices.\n\nThere is rising uncertainty over how this conflict might affect the expected lift of sanctions on Iran, said Gao Jian, an energy analyst at Guangzhou, China-based SCI International. Any possibility of a delay or a cancellation of the ban lift will be positive to oil prices.\n\nAlso read:Man who nailed 2015 oil plunge is predicting a dismal 2016\n\nPetroleum products on Nymex edged higher Monday.

The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen on Monday after recording its largest weekly loss since August 2013 last week.\n\nDollar gains persisted even as China stocks tumbled SHCOMP, +0.51% and oil prices CLG26, +0.10% fell. U.S. stocks SPX, -0.37% finished mostly higher after a choppy trading session.\n\nThe dollar USDJPY, +0.19% traded at Â¥117.52 late Monday in New York, compared with Â¥117.25 late Friday. The dollar slid 2.6% on the yen last week, and 0.6% against the euro EURUSD, -0.53% . The euro last traded around $1.0873, versus $1.0917 Friday.\n\nRead: The yen rally won't last, and that could be good news for stocks\n\nAtlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said he saw nothing fundamentally wrong with the broad U.S. economy despite the bearish global stock environment, but his words had little impact on the market.\n\nDallas Fed President Rob Kaplan will speak on economic conditions and monetary policy in Dallas, Texas at 7:50 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe South African rand USDZAR, +0.71% collapsed to record lows on Monday, sinking 10% to nearly 18 to the U.S. dollar, before trimming its losses.

If options traders are correct, stocks are in for a wild ride in February.\n\nDemand for one-month call options tied to the CBOE Volatility Index, a popular gauge of stock-market volatility, has spiked in the past week. The increased demand suggests that some investors are bracing for selloff following the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nIn that time, investors have purchased 250,000 VIX call options with a strike price at 21, and another 100,000 with the strike at 22, according to Brian Bier, head of sales and trading at Macro Risk Advisors, an options brokerage. The options cost roughly 49 cents per contract, Bier said.\n\nBy comparison, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% was at 12.41 in early trade on Tuesday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% were on track to open lower.\n\nRead: VIX raises near-term caution flag amid otherwise bullish S&P 500 backdrop\n\nAlso read: The VIX is low, but it's too low to signal a major market top\n\nCheck out: Wall Street's 'fear gauge' shows it's about to get wild in the stock market\n\nIt would take a massive selloff to make these options profitable, Bier said.\n\nCall options represent bets that the level or price of a given asset or index will rise during a given timeâ€”in this case, the period between Friday and Feb. 15, when these options expire.\n\nInvestors frequently use VIX futures and options as a hedge against volatility. That way, if stocks tank, they can offset some of those losses with the profits from their options trades.\n\nEven in the current low volatility environment, we've seen a lot of people still looking at the VIX as a hedge, Bier said.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, stock-market volatility has been relatively subdued despite increasing uncertainty surrounding the future direction of fiscal and monetary policy in the U.S. The Daily Shot, a popular market newsletter, illustrates this divergence in the chart below.\n\nThe Daily Shot\n\nAside from the beginning of Trump's first 100 days in office, a period where investors expect Trump to begin implementing his plans for infrastructure spending, trade and deregulation, there are no clear market-moving catalysts, Bier said.\n\nAnother reason for the increase in demand for one-month VIX options could be that they're cheap relative to three-month, six-month and nine-month options, Bier said.\n\nInvestors are getting advantageous prices on hedging in the short end of the curve, Bier said.\n\nSince touching a five-month high on Nov. 4, volatility has trended lower as U.S. stocks embarked on a torrid rally that took the Dow to within a hair's breadth of the 20,000 milestone last week. But stocks have struggled to build on their gains this week, and some Wall Street analysts are saying that the inauguration could mark a near-term top.\n\nTrump will take the oath of office on Friday.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday he's flexible about future monetary policy moves but inflexible about completing his four-year term at the helm of the U.S. central bank.\n\nIn a moderated discussion at the American Economics Association meeting in Atlanta, Powell said he would not resign if asked by President Donald Trump. The president has frequently criticized Powell in interviews and tweets, leading to a debate about whether he might try to force the Fed chairman out.\n\nRelated:Why Trump can't fire Powell for disagreement over monetary policy\n\nIn his remarks about the economy and monetary policy, Powell stressed to uneasy financial markets that the central bank wasn't going to push interest rates higher or shrink the balance sheet regardless of the cost.\n\nMonetary policy was not on a preset course\n\nWe will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, given the low inflation outlook, he said.\n\nThe central bank is prepared to shift course significantly if necessary.\n\nWe will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibility and to use all our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate, Powell said.\n\nFinancial markets, notably the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% , have plummeted over fears the Fed intended to move into restrictive territory or deliberately slow the economy down. Stocks rallied on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% jumping more than 700 points at the peak.\n\nPowell said the Fed was alert that financial markets were signaling concern about downside risks to the economy. But he pushed back on the pessimism, saying the hard economic data, including the jobs report released earlier Friday, signaled continued economic momentum into 2019.\n\nRead:U.S. gains 312,000 jobs in 10-month high that shattered Wall Street forecasts\n\nThe chairman specifically stressed that this flexibility included the runoff of the Fed's balance sheet. At a press conference last month, Powell had said that process was on autopilot.\n\nThe central banker also played down investor concerns about China's economy that spiked after Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% cut its revenue forecast late Wednesday, citing weakness in the country's economy. Powell said he expected growth to continue this year in China.\n\nThe Fed will take a risk management approach to policy decisions in coming months, Powell said.\n\nThe Fed has penciled in two rate increases this year. Investors think it is likely that rates don't move higher in 2019.\n\nWard McCarthy, chief financial economist, at Jefferies, said Powell took rate increases off the table in January and March.\n\nThe [Federal Open Market Committee] is not done raising rates, butâ€¦is not going to raise rates at a time when inflation will be falling below target and financial conditions are tightening, McCarthy wrote in a Friday note to clients.\n\nJ.P. Morgan economists lowered their expectations of rate hikes.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was retreating sharply lower on Tuesday, with the blue-chip gauge on pace for its worst single-session decline in about 8 months. The Dow DJIA, -0.46% was off more than 350 points at its nadir, putting it on pace to suffer its steepest slide since May 17, 2017, according to FactSet data, when it fell 373 points or 1.8%. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% were also facing selling pressure, and threatening to mark the first back-to-back declines for those benchmarks in January. Moves lower come ahead of President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech later Tuesday and as investors await the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. Rising yields have contributed to concerns as well, with the 10-year Treasury yield climbing above 2.72% for the first time in three years.
The Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates at a faster pace if the Trump administration's fiscal policies focus too much on short-term demand and not enough on long-term factors to strengthen the economy, Fed. Gov. Lael Brainard suggested on Tuesday.\n\nWith the economy already close to full employment and 2% inflation, focusing fiscal policy on boosting short-term demand will more likely result in inflationary pressures, and is relatively more likely to be accompanied by increases in interest rates, Brainard said in a speech to the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe Fed governor, who was widely touted as a possible Treasury secretary if Hillary Clinton had won the White House, said fiscal policy should focus instead on raising the growth rate of productivity and pushing more Americans off the sidelines and into the labor market.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen also sounded cool to the idea of new fiscal stimulus, saying it was a better idea when there was more slack in the U.S. labor force than there presently is.\n\nBrainard meanwhile said recent data paint a picture of a resilient and gently improving U.S. economy.\n\nInflation is making gradual progress toward the Fed's 2% target, Brainard said.\n\nEven so, some slack may remain in the labor market, she said.\n\nBased on recent spending data, we might expect progress [on the Fed's goals] to continue to be gradual and steady, she said.\n\nHowever, if fiscal policy changes lead to a more rapid elimination of slack, policy adjustment would, all else being equal, likely be more rapid than otherwise, she said.\n\nIn addition, the conditions the Fed has set for shrinking its balance sheet would be met sooner than they otherwise would have been, Brainard added.
HONG KONG (MarketWatch) â€” It used to be that investors outside China could ignore the gyrations in that country's stock market, given that no foreign investors were allowed to buy shares. But that's clearly not the case anymore as declines in Shanghai SHCOMP, +0.51% and botched circuit-breaker curbs helped push the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38% to its worst four-day start to a year on record.\n\nMust read:China stocks recover from plunge as nerves settle\n\nOne explanation for the severity of the reaction is that it brings to the fore a worry most investors would rather not think about â€” Beijing is no longer really in control of its equity markets, currency and the world's second largest economy.\n\nThis latest policy misstep again exposes a fundamental contradiction with the ruling communist party: it wants to liberalize markets and access capital but only if it can control the direction of prices. This conflict is proving harder and harder to square away.\n\nFor now China has abandoned its experiment with new circuit breakers that triggered the wider panic. As Nomura comments, the circuit breakers were well-intended but functioned as super-charged accelerators for investor fears and market volatility.\n\nChinese Stocks Make a U-Turn\n\nKnowing the market might close, investors were rushing to sell, leading to a mere 15-minute trading session on Thursday.\n\nPart of this is due to obvious technical problems in the design. While a 7% fall in the benchmark index lead to trading being halted for the whole day, in the U.S. a similar move would only trigger a 15- minute halt and full-day suspension needs moves of 20%.\n\nChina already has 10% daily limits up or down on individual stocks, which are regularly reached. Any circuit breakers should have taken into account the volatility in a market when some 90% of investors are retail and the market prohibits intraday trading.\n\nRemoving the circuit breakers helped calm Friday's trading with Shanghai shares finishing up 1.95%, but it is still a temporary fix.\n\nChinese equities remain an artificial market and vulnerable to further falls given restrictions on selling and substantial government ownership from last summer's intervention.\n\nAuthorities have now promised more of the same. The ban on large shareholders selling has been extended and the government is back in the market buying.\n\nThe stock overhang remains even if it has been pushed out; will these stock owners ultimately be forced sellers or will they just decide liquidity restrictions make equities as an asset class too risky?\n\nThe resilience of demand where the government and the so-called National Team is the main buyer is the other risk to the market. Buying fatigue is likely if losses continue.\n\nThis intervention has also left a dysfunctional market where investing is simply knowing which day or stocks the government is buying, meaning many investors, particularly institutions cannot participate.\n\nA key reason China's stock turmoil has such a global impact is it is now coinciding with capital outflows and currency weakness. In fact, the beginning of large fund outflows can be traced back to the controversial stock intervention last summer, where Beijing's attempt to coerce markets faced widespread criticism.\n\nBeijing is now walking a delicate path, as the more expectations grow of currency weakness, the greater the risks of a stampede in capital outflows. And today China's currency markets are much more plugged into global markets than its stock indices after efforts to internationalize the yuan USDCNY, +0.07% , meaning the potential contagion here is more obvious.\n\nThis week it was revealed that China's foreign reserves fell by a record $108 billion in December, reinforcing worries that capital outflows are worsening as spending by the central bank to support the yuan increases.\n\nWhile China still has $3.33 trillion of foreign reserves, the concern is how long it can continue intervening if capital outflows stay elevated. To give some idea of the strength of capital outflows, they have come despite China still running surpluses on its balance of payments and foreign direct investment.\n\nThe problem for policy makers is outflows are hard to control, as it let so much foreign capital in during the good times when the policy-driven yuan pegged to the greenback was a safe-haven. Last year Daiwa Research estimated the carry trade into China could be some $3 trillion. So far at least China's offshore bond markets have proved resilient despite equity falls, which would be an indicator of greater unease.\n\nFor investors, policy uncertainty looms large so long as it remains obvious the current path being steered by Beijing is not working. China cannot reflate its economy or stock market if money outflows continue accelerating.\n\nHere global markets would have much to consider. The policy prescription would be a sizeable one-off devaluation of the yuan, potentially sparking a new round of destabilizing currency wars.
Treasury yields cemented their fourth straight weekly drop on Friday, the longest winning streak since July, as attractive valuations and uncertainty over the details of President-elect Donald Trump's policies caused traders to rethink their positions.\n\nYields, which move inversely to prices, rose sharply early in the session after data showed wholesale price inflation accelerated in 2016, but government-bond yields steadily pared their gains as demand intensified ahead of the long holiday weekend. Bond markets are closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\n\nThe Producer Price Index showed wholesale prices increased by 1.6% in 2016, roughly in line with economists' expectations. Wholesale prices are an early indicator of consumer-price growth because companies typically mark up the prices of goods on their shelves to offset the higher prices paid to distributors. Much of the increase was attributed to rising energy costs.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% declined 3.8 basis points to 2.380% this week despite rising 2.2 basis points on Friday.\n\nSimilarly, the yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.455% shed 2.6 basis points on the week to 2.976%, despite adding 2.2 basis points on Friday. The yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.157% declined 1.7 basis point to 1.173% this week, limited by a 1.7-basis point rise Friday.\n\nBond traders pay close attention to inflation data because investors typically demand higher returns to offset rising consumer prices. Rising inflation erodes the value of a bond's fixed payments, particularly in longer-dated paper.\n\nInflation is really what's going to drive rates this year, said Charlie Ripley, assistant vice president of capital markets and trading at Allianz Investment Management.\n\nMeanwhile, weak readings on consumer sentiment and retail sales didn't have much of an impact on the market, analysts said.\n\nSales at U.S. retailers in December fell short of economists' lofty expectations, which Ripley said suggested that U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter.\n\nSome market strategists said the hope that investors will soon hear more details about President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal plans was primarily responsible for Friday's rise.\n\nIt's a function of fiscal expectations for the coming weeks, said Chirag Mirani, interest-rate strategist at UBS. The U.S. presidential inauguration is set for Jan. 20 and market participants are anticipating that Trump may deliver more specifics about his policy proposals then after disappointing the market with a dearth of details at a closely watched news conference Wednesday.\n\nThough it may be that the market rallied too much earlier in the week, and now we're getting consolidation, he added.\n\nSeveral of the largest U.S. banks reported earnings Friday morning, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.65% , which said increased trading volume following the U.S. presidential election helped boost the bank's fourth-quarter profits.\n\nWells Fargo & Co. WFC, +2.43% said profit fell in the fourth quarter, the first full quarter after a sales-tactics scandal forced the resignation of longtime chief executive John Stumpf.\n\nBank of America BAC, +2.61% said fourth-quarter profit rose 43% thanks to an uptick in trading.\n\nBonds sold off sharply following the U.S. election as investors bet that Trump's proposed fiscal policies would boost economic growth and stoke inflationary pressures.\n\nTreasurys have since retraced some of this drop as Federal Reserve policy makers warned that they would wait for Trump's policies to come into focus before committing to a pace of interest-rates hikes.
Net-worth poverty â€” a measure of poverty concerning wealth rather than income â€” affected one in three U.S. households with kids even prior to the pandemic-induced recession and has disproportionately struck families of color, a new study says.\n\nFifty-seven percent of Black households with children and 50% of Latino households with children were net-worth poor in 2019, versus 24% among white households, according to a study by Duke University researchers published in the Journal of Marriage and Family.\n\nNet-worth poor means a household's net worth â€” total assets minus total debts â€” falls below a quarter of the federal poverty level, the researchers said. In other words, net-worth poverty is a measure of whether a household has enough resources to meet basic needs for three months, they added.\n\nHouseholds living in net-worth poverty lack a financial cushion to provide for their children's basic needs, study co-author Christina Gibson-Davis, a Duke professor of public policy and sociology, said in a statement.\n\nThese 'net-worth poor' households have no assets to withstand a sudden economic loss, like we have seen with COVID-19, she said. Even before the pandemic, many families with children were in a precarious situation. Things are not going to get better in the wake of COVID-19.\n\nThe study analyzed U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances data from 1989 to 2019 on households with at least one resident member under 18. The sample included 19,013 households.\n\n 'When a household has few or no assets, even a minor financial setback can make it difficult to pay for necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.'  â€” Journal of Marriage and Family article\n\nWhile both income and wealth are significant factors in child wellbeing, net-worth poverty (a measure of the adequacy of the stock of resources owned by a household) may provide a better snapshot of long-term household financial stability than income poverty, which measures the adequacy of a flow of resources, the authors suggested.\n\nWealth, as a store of value, therefore represents goods that a household can access to meet unexpected expenses, buffer against income loss, or contend with economic shocks, such as medical emergencies, that can deplete financial reserves, they wrote. When a household has few or no assets, even a minor financial setback can make it difficult to pay for necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter.\n\nThe researchers found that net-worth poverty was more prevalent than income poverty across demographic groups, with white, Latino and Black households with kids two to three times as likely to experience net-worth poverty than income poverty.\n\nMost net-worth poor households with children weren't income-poor, they said. Net-worth poverty, unlike income poverty, is increasing.\n\nNet-worth poverty rates among Black households with children rose from 46% in 2001 to 51% in 2007 and kept inching upward until 2013, after which they decreased slightly. In white households they increased from 24% to 30% during the Great Recession, but have decreased since then, the authors wrote. The increase in net-worth poverty for Black households, when combined with the null increase for white households, has widened the racial gap over time, they wrote.\n\nNet-worth poverty rates in Latino households, meanwhile, saw small changes over time and hewed closely to trends for white households.\n\nCentering policy efforts solely on income poverty won't fully address the problems these families face, the authors argued. They suggested pro-wealth accumulation strategies such as expanding child-care or housing subsidies to free up net income and relaxing safety-net programs' asset tests.\n\nMost policies focus on income and families meeting their day-to-day needs, co-author Lisa Gennetian, a Duke associate professor of early learning policy studies, said in a statement. These efforts are important. But our findings suggest that they are not helping families increase savings that help set children up for success.
As a new Congress starts work this month, voters are eager for lawmakers to address student debt.\n\nThat's one finding of a poll of more than 1,000 adults released Monday by Politico and Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Among educational issues, respondents said they're most eager for Congress to find ways to lower student debt.\n\nRoughly 87% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans said it would be extremely important for Congress to find ways to decrease student debt.\n\n Roughly 87% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans said it would be extremely important for Congress to find ways to decrease student debt. \n\nWith 44 million Americans contending with $1.5 trillion in student debt, it's no wonder families are anxious. For some, a student-loan bill may be just one on top of many making it more difficult to save for a house, retirement or a career switch.\n\nThe poll results indicate that politics may soon catch up to the reality borrowers are facing, said Mark Huelsman, the associate director of policy and research at Demos, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nIt's a sign of the increasing anxiety that voters and families are feeling about their own debt or their children going into to debt or them going into debt for their children, he said.\n\nAs the 2020 campaign for president (and other offices) heats up, addressing student debt may provide an opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to lure voters who may feel more of a sense of urgency surrounding their student loan bill than addressing college costs for their future children, Huelsman added.\n\n 'It's a sign of the increasing anxiety that voters and families are feeling about their own debt or their children going into to debt or them going into debt for their children.'  â€” â€”Mark Huelsman, the associate director of policy and research at Demos\n\nFor others, the consequences of student debt can be even more dire, including lost wages, tax refunds and government benefits. More broadly, student loans can exacerbate inequality by making it difficult for low-income borrowers and people of color to move up the economic ladder.\n\nAs college costs have jumped over the past few decades, student debt has gone from a relatively niche and manageable personal finance issue to a common American experience. And politicians, particularly a younger crop of lawmakers who have personal experience with student debt, are starting to notice.\n\nAlmost all of the Democratic candidates in the 2016 presidential election included some provision that would make tuition at public colleges free or debt-free. During the 2018 midterm campaign, more candidates â€” most prominently Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York City â€” began talking openly about some form of debt forgiveness, an issue that didn't feature prominently in the mainstream 2016 campaign.\n\nOcasio-Cortez even identified student-debt cancellation as one of many issues progressive public servants might discuss on social media to gain traction with voters and followers.\n\nEconomists also appear to be taking the idea of student-debt cancellation more seriously, which could provide some intellectual backing to candidates interested in campaigning on the issue. A study released last year by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in Annandale-On-Hudson, N.Y. found that wiping out the nation's student debt could have a positive impact on the economy.\n\nAddressing student debt is probably more analogous to addressing housing affordability or addressing health care or addressing anything that is impacting a family's bottom line, Huelsman said.
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged fresh records on the back of robust earnings but both indexes finished off intraday highs in volatile trading as the buck rebounded following President Donald Trump's dollar-supportive comments.\n\nA stronger dollar, while a symbol of the U.S. economic prowess, can also hurt the competitiveness of companies who derive a significant portion of their revenue overseas.\n\nHow did the benchmarks fare?\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.46% rose 140.67 points, or 0.5%, to end at 26,392.79, with shares of 3M Co.

Japan is the catalyst that could bring the record-setting bull market for stocks across the globe to a screeching halt, according to SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale's uberbear Albert Edwards.\n\nThe prominent SocGen strategist says surprise monetary tightening in Japan could be the trigger that finally upend what has been an protracted and unrelenting global rally for assets considered risky.\n\n 'This could be far more important than the Fed. A lot of major trends start with Japan. People don't focus on Japan enough in my view.'  â€” â€”SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale global strategist Albert Edwards\n\nWhile most investors are busy eyeing rate increases in the U.S. and tapering by the European Central Bank in the eurozone, Edwards says they should also watch developments in the world's third-largest economy, Japan, where corporate profits are surging and inflation has picked up.\n\nWe've been looking for surprises and one thing that can catch us out is if the Bank of Japan starts tightening. If it actually follows the Fed and the ECB and announces some sort of tapering, he said, speaking at SocGen's annual strategy conference in London on Tuesday.\n\nThis could be far more important than the Fed. A lot of major trends start with Japan. People don't focus on Japan enough in my view, he added.\n\nInvestors already on Tuesday got a taste of how BOJ tightening can rattle the markets. The central bank said it would buy less of its long-dated bonds, sparking speculation Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda could back away from its ultraloose monetary policy as early as this year.\n\nThe surprise announcement sent global bond markets into spin on Tuesday. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% jumped above 2.5% to its highest since March and the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% logged its biggest one-day jump since Dec. 19.\n\nSome strategists, however, argue that the recent news was more a technical than philosophical shift by the central bank. Read: Relax, the Bank of Japan isn't taperingâ€”yet!\n\nThe BOJ has for years been among the most accommodative central banks in the world and as recent as December reaffirmed its commitment to aggressive qualitative and quantitative-easing program, also known as QQE. With inflation stubbornly running below the BOJ's 2% annual target, the central bank has since early 2016 kept interest rates in negative territory and even introduced a 0%-target for its 10-year government bond yields to avoid deflation.\n\nThe determined efforts by the BOJ to boost consumer prices have turned investors against the yen USDJPY, -0.01% , with data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showing an extreme bearishness toward the Japanese currency.\n\nHowever, downbeat investors on the yen could be caught flat-footed if inflation starts to pick up, prompting the BOJ to halt easing efforts, Edwards warned. Core inflation in the country has bottomed, as the following chart illustrates, while more than 60% of households now expect inflation rather than deflation, he pointed out.\n\nSociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale\n\nWhat happens if the BOJ tightens instead of weakens as everyone is positioned for? What if the yen strengthens and [the dollar] breaks through Â¥107? That would be a major surprise, Edwards said.\n\nIf you are looking for something as a trigger for the great unwind, this could be it.
Just the threat of inflationâ€”germinating in a tightening labor marketâ€”was enough to prompt only the second U.S. interest-rate hike in a decade last month, as well as projections for gradual Federal Reserve rate tightening in 2017.\n\nBut that reflects a largely a U.S.-centric view. In fact, fears that inflation's grip poses real, and fast-moving, risks to the global economy are overblown, argue some analysts.\n\nHigher inflation expectations had driven the U.S. dollar index DXY, +0.41% to 14-year highs before its recent stall, although that impact can be slow to filter into the everyday economy. And, what's been called a reflation trade had created an exodus out of bonds and into stocks to a degree that some observers say finally threatens the bond market's multidecade bull run.\n\nBut the global picture is different and could help keep U.S. inflation in check, considering the scope of global trade and investment flows\n\nDon't miss:Here's why the U.S. dollar could soar by another 30%\n\nTalk of 'global reflation' seems wide of the mark, said Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist with Capital Economics.\n\nConsumer price inflation is set to rise in most advanced economies, with the U.S. rate likely to reach around 3% by the middle of this year and creep higher in 2018, Capital Economics projected. The Fed prefers inflation to run around 2% give or take, and its favorite inflation gauge, the PCE reading carved out of the GDP report, actually decelerated late in 2016.\n\nThere are unknowns, of course. For one, President-elect Donald Trump's expected fiscal-stimulus plans, still light on details, could put further upward pressure on wages and prices.\n\nRead:Has U.S. inflation's rebirth been over-forecast?\n\nInflation is also on track to exceed the Bank of England's 2% target in the U.K. and will probably stay there for two or three years, due to the slump in sterling that followed the country's June vote to exit from the European Union.\n\nBut in many countries, underlying price pressures will continue to be very weak, said Kenningham.\n\nHere's why the inflation warning flags may be flying prematurely:\n\nEnergy's impact: A year ago, energy price deflation was subtracting 1 percentage point from the headline inflation rate tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Kenningham noted. Energy prices are no longer deflationary, but narrowing the inflation watch strictly to energy's impact can be shortsighted.\n\nCapital Economics predicts Brent crude prices will be $60 a barrel at the end of 2017. The chart suggests that energy inflation will spike in early 2017 and average around 10% in the year as a whole, they said.\n\nEurozone troubles: Core inflation is very subdued in the eurozone, particularly outside of Germany, and there is a lot of spare capacity in most countries. European Central Bank policy makers, in minutes from the December meeting that helped explain the decision to extend its bond-buying program, said that while inflation is expected to rise significantly over the coming months due to higher energy prices, underlying inflation had failed to show any clear signs of a convincing upturn.\n\nIn Japan, too: Capital Economics expects inflation in Japan to stay below 2% for most of the next two years. It will take around six months for the recent depreciation of the yen to feed through to consumer prices, while Japan will continue to be affected by weak aggregate demand and low inflation expectations, said Kenningham.\n\nRead:The biggest global risks in 2017, from the World Economic Forum\n\nThe growth and inflation story gets more vulnerable when the outlook is pushed out.\n\nWe revised up our global growth and inflation forecasts for the next two years for the first time since early 2012 (albeit only in line with the mediocre growth rates of recent years), with the upgrade coming from developed economies. Expectations may be getting too high, though, said Janet Henry, chief global economist with HSBC Bank. An upturn in the global industrial cycle does not tell us much about long-term growth prospects, especially while protectionism is a real threat.\n\nShe means that the pro-growth domestic priorities may come at the expense of trade, a potential drag on global growth.\n\nChina is a wild card\n\nThe biggest unknown for global inflation risks may lie with China. Consumer prices in China decelerated in December, up 2.1% that month from a year earlier, compared with a 2.3% November rise. It was the first time in four months that the rate slowed.\n\nBut wholesale prices jumped more than expected, up 5.5% in December, compared with November's 3.3%, and continuing a potentially inflationary upswing that began in September. A deflationary trend had persisted for more than four years. In fact, for all of 2016 producer prices dropped 1.4% on average from a year earlier, while consumer prices rose 2%.\n\nWhile in January 2016 the common fear was deflation and hard landing, now the concerns are inflation and financial risks tied in particular to a potential real estate-asset bubble and rising rental costs, said analysts at Macquarie Group, in a research note.\n\nWhat's more, political uncertainty remains elevated as elections loom in Germany, France, and the Netherlands.\n\nA sustained rise in global inflation is likely only if there is a widespread shift to expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, said Kenningham. For now, there are few signs that policy makers outside the U.S. will unveil a major fiscal stimulus or that central banks will resort to more radical optionsâ€¦The upshot is that for much of the world, there is still a greater risk of inflation being too low than too high.

The head of the world's largest hedge fund agrees with Democratic-Socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the need to address yawning income equality in the U.S., but he warned that her strategy of taxing the super-wealthy could have unintended consequences on the economy.\n\n'We're in agreement on the problem that's behind that suggestion, Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, said in an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. We have to make capitalism work for the majority of Americans. I don't know that we're in agreement on the mechanics.\n\n 'We're in agreement on the problem that's behind that suggestion. We have to make capitalism work for the majority of Americans. I don't know that we're in agreement on the mechanics.'  â€” â€” Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates\n\nDalio added, How tax rates are changed will have a huge effect on incentives and could have a huge effect on capital flows, and that will have big effects on markets and economies. It's going to be a bigger market-influencing issue than people now realize.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's mention in early January of a 70% tax on the wealthy provoked heated reaction from both supporters and detractors, with House Republican whip Steve Scalise deriding the idea as a leftist fantasy program.\n\nBut the debate sparked by the Democrat from New York also revealed some misunderstandings about how America's tax system works.\n\nMarginal vs. average tax rates\n\nOn CBS' 60 Minutes Ocasio-Cortez mentioned that historically America has had higher tax rates, and that in the 1960s, once you get to the tippy tops, on your 10 millionth dollar, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60% or 70%.\n\nThough Ocasio-Cortez added that the 70% rate wouldn't apply to all of that income, that detail seemed to get lost in the contentious aftermath. Her comments were widely interpreted as meaning that she wanted the federal government to take 70% of Americans' income in taxes, a view Scalise broadcast on Twitter TWTR, -1.47% .\n\n 'If you're Scrooge McDuck, hedge fund manager, much of your income comes from investments. It's coming from long-term capital gains or dividends, which are preferentially taxed.'  â€” â€”Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center\n\nBut as Ocasio-Cortez clarified in subsequent tweets, her 60 Minutes comments referred to the marginal tax rate.\n\nWhat does that mean? Here's the key distinction: Marginal tax rates are only applied to part of someone's income, not to all of their earnings. In other words, someone making $10 million would not lose 70% of that money to taxes under Ocasio-Cortez's proposal. A 70% marginal tax rate on earnings above $10 million would only apply to the portion of income above $10 million.\n\nA household's average tax rate â€” also called their effective tax rate â€” is the total share of their income that they pay in taxes.\n\nDon't miss:How the new tax law creates a 'perfect storm' for Roth IRA conversions\n\nFor example, if you were getting paid $11 million at your current job, only the last $1 million would be taxed at 70%, said Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. The remainder would be taxed at lower tax rates used for lower incomes.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between the marginal tax rate and the average rate, Mazur told MarketWatch.\n\nA household's average tax rate â€” also called their effective tax rate â€” is the total share of their income that they pay in taxes. It's usually much lower than their top marginal rate, as this chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows.\n\nTax brackets vs. tax rates\n\nThis is where tax brackets come in. A tax bracket refers to the range of income that gets taxed at a particular rate.\n\nBut here's another critical point that gets lost in the social-media scrum: Just because you're in a 24% tax bracket doesn't mean your entire income is taxed at 24%. Under current tax law, if you were a single person, you would only pay that 24% rate in 2019 on income between $84,201 and $168,400.\n\n 'If this 70% tax bracket only applies to earned income, then it's only going to hit a very small slice of people who earn income above that level.'  â€” â€”Daniel Bunn, director of global projects at the Tax Foundation\n\nMarginal tax rates have fluctuated since income tax was established. The top marginal tax rate peaked at 92% in the early 1950s, according to the Tax Policy Center. In 2019, under the new tax law, the top marginal rate of 37% will apply to income above $510,300 for unmarried individuals, according to the Tax Foundation.\n\nThere is more than one way to tax the rich\n\nOcasio-Cortez's tax proposal is aimed at the super-rich, but when it comes to taxes, the super-rich are different from you and me, as F. Scott Fitzgerald may or may not have said. (And as MarketWatch reporter Brett Arends pointed out this week, they may also share many of the same qualities.)\n\nIncreasing taxes on earned income wouldn't necessarily hit the rich where it hurts the most.\n\nAs Mazur noted, when Americans envision a rich person they may think of an NFL player with a $22 million yearly salary. But in reality many of America's wealthy don't accrue their wealth from paychecks, also known as earned income.\n\nIf you're Scrooge McDuck, hedge fund manager, much of your income comes from investments, Mazur said. It's coming from long-term capital gains or dividends, which are preferentially taxed. (Long-term capital gains tax rates, for example, range from 0% to 20% this year.)\n\nIf this 70% tax bracket only applies to earned income, then it's only going to hit a very small slice of people who earn income above that level, said Daniel Bunn, director of global projects at the Tax Foundation.\n\nOne thing that's generally true is that folks that have income of $10 million or more, a lot of their income is what you would call unearned income: capital gains, or benefits from a business that you own or operate, and that may put you in a position where you're not necessarily taxed at what you might otherwise think based on the top marginal rate, he added.\n\nThose earning income above $10 million is a much narrower group than the top 1% â€” it probably amounts to fewer than 0.05% of households, Bunn said.\n\nDalio touched on that point in his comments at Davos. If we're to have a 70% marginal tax rate, most individuals affected by it will calculate whether they should instead operate as a corporation in order to convert ordinary income to capital gains, so I wonder how that will be handled, he said, according to CNBC. And I wonder what will be done to influence whether capital will leave the country.\n\nWho pays the most taxes?\n\nWhile there are examples of rich people in the United States paying very low average tax rates, our system is â€” on the whole â€” average rate progressive, said Daniel Hemel, an assistant law professor specializing in taxation at the University of Chicago law school. Average rate progressive means that average tax rates rise with income.\n\nFor 2019, the overall average tax rate (accounting for all types of federal taxes) is 31.1% for families in the top 0.1%, 25.2% for families in the top 10th of income earners, and 18.4% overall, Hemel said, citing Treasury Department data.\n\nThe top 1% of income earners paid an average tax rate of 26.9% in 2016, while the bottom 50% of income earners paid an average tax rate of 3.7%, according to IRS data, Bunn said.\n\nThis story was updated on Jan. 23, 2019.
China's hardening nationalism and global ambitions are the most significant foreign policy challenges facing President-elect Joe Biden, but his top defense and economic appointees will require a lot of on-the-job training.\n\nChina is building cyberwar capabilities that could cripple U.S. electric utilities and satellite navigation systems and quickly defeat the U.S. fleet in the Pacific. Strengthening and rebalancing of American deterrence in the Pacific are required to avert a potential disaster.\n\nDomestic economic strength and greater equality are preconditions for the military resources and diplomatic soft power needed to counter China, but Biden exhibits too much nostalgia for multilateralism, manufacturing and strong unions.\n\nBoth China and the United States seek leadership in artificial intelligence, microprocessors and other technologies to create weapons, wealth and jobs. Overlaying that, globalization, economies of scale and network effects are creating high tech behemoths like Ant and Facebook FB, +1.69% that can challenge the sovereign authority of Beijing and Washington.\n\nEmerging digital empires don't employ a lot of factory workers for unions to organize or create large glass-tower bureaucracies that could offer more opportunities for women and minorities without STEM degrees or equivalent technical training.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping is at once subsidizing and subordinating Chinese high tech to support its surveillance state and assist Beijing's ambitions to replace the liberal political and economic international order with a soft adherence to its autocratic, state-directed capitalism.\n\nU.S. antitrust enforcement risks neutering Big Tech leaders by limiting their scope to branch out into new businesses or breaking them up altogether. That risks leaving America challenged to match Chinese manufactures like Huawei and software wonders like WeChat and reducing America to a technological vassal state in an emerging Chinese technological empire.\n\nSTEM apprenticeships\n\nIf Biden really wants to help women and minoritiesâ€”and American competitivenessâ€”he should aim to double the number of capable students enrolled in university STEM disciplines and technology apprenticeships. And support incubators for new high-tech competitors to challenge Facebook and Google GOOG, -0.07% instead of breaking them up.\n\nThe pledge of 30 CEOs from big companies, including IBM IBM, +0.62% and Merck MRK, +0.64% to create 1 million jobs for Black Americans is laudable but naive without recognition that many high school graduates are poorly equipped to train for the jobs in the digital economy.\n\nPresident Donald Trump fell into the same trap as his predecessors. He let Beijing lure him into three years of trade and investment negotiations instead of acting quickly with measures tough enough to disrupt the Chinese economy and force results.\n\nTrump's tariffs were not enough and Beijing undercut U.S. domestic support by promising Wall Street financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, GS, +0.95% , JP Morgan JPM, +1.03% and BlackRock BLK, +0.71% better treatment in the Middle Kingdom. The Phase One Trade Deal to open Chinese markets for American products is failing, other than for farm goods and U.S. banks.\n\nChinese mercantilism\n\nTools of Chinese mercantilismâ€”forced technology transfer and patent theft, export subsidies and markets closed to U.S. exports outside of agriculture and in some measure bankingâ€”remain largely in place. Biden can hardly expect to combat those by simply embracing multilateralism in the World Trade Organization with European cooperation.\n\nNational security adviser John Ratcliffe reports Beijing is cultivating members of Congress, whose constituents' employment may be dependent on Chinese investments, just as it plied Wall Street during Trump's trade war. And former Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying is preaching to American intellectuals and media that cooperative competition is now possible between the United States and China.\n\nNeither Biden nor his key security and economic appointments appear sensitive to or have substantial experience with all this.\n\nTo head the National Economic Council, Biden has chosen an executive at the center of China's deal with Wall Streetâ€”Blackrock's head of sustainable investing Brian Deese. For U.S. Trade Representative, Katherine Tai is an outstanding trade lawyer but has not held a high-level policy position or demonstrated much systemic vision.\n\nAt Treasury, Janet Yellen, a labor economist who proved uninventive at the Fed, will reflexively support free trade and emphasize Keynesian solutions when our problems are more industrial-strategic and structural. At Defense, Gen. Lloyd Austin offers great experience fighting land wars in the Middle East, but the paramount security challenges are cyber and naval in the Pacific.\n\nEach is highly accomplished and worthy of high-level responsibilities, but they are the wrong pegs in the wrong hole for the challenges China poses.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and emeritus business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.
The start of a New Year is a perfect time to get financial, fitness and lifestyle resolutions in order â€” and a number of apps will help you make a quick buck while also de-cluttering your life.\n\nNearly 50% of Americans say saving money is their top resolution for 2017, according to a CareerBuilder Survey conducted by Harris Poll. In addition to making spending and saving plans for the new year, consider starting the year off by selling some unused goods â€” the outlets to do so have expanded far beyond Craigslist and eBay EBAY, -0.17% . A number of Craigslist rivals have gained traction in recent years and offer specialized apps to help people sell specific kinds of products, including electronics or furniture, have emerged as well. So if cleaning out your closet is also on the New Year to-do list, here are some online services and apps that can help you sell your goods.\n\n1. Gazelle\n\nUsed electronics marketplace Gazelle offers a simple and straightforward platform to trade in pre-owned devices. The website puts a price on used devices users submit based on age, condition and model and sends them pre-paid packaging to mail in the product. Once the device is traded in, the seller receives payment by either check, Amazon gift card or PayPal. Gazelle operates only in the U.S. and has a rating of 4.92 out of 5 from the Better Business Bureau. Although sellers may be able to make more money by putting their products on Craigslist or eBay, Gazelle streamlines the selling process for someone willing to sacrifice some profit for convenience.\n\n2. Poshmark\n\nRevamping your wardrobe could make you a quick buck with sales app Poshmark. The service is geared toward women's clothing and accessories, particularly designer brands. Users upload photos of available items directly to their page on the app and can promote them through special sales and events advertised to their followers, which they gain through the app. Poshmark takes a flat commission of $2.95 on sales under $15 and 20% of sales more than $15. Manish Chandra, CEO of Poshmark, said 1 in every 50 women in America sell their style on the marketplace.\n\nChandra said Poshmark helps put value on inventory that's just sitting in people's closets and distributes hundreds of millions of dollars back into the pockets of women and men across the country.\n\n3. Letgo\n\nThis person-to-person listing app functions as a more polished version of Craigslist, letting users advertise electronics, jewelry and other products, based on location. Letgo merged with rival listing app Wallapop in early 2016 and is free to download and use. It raised more than $200 million from its shareholders to build out its business after the merger Letgo does not take a commission from sales made and relies on investors for now. Users coordinate sales in the app's chat feature and meet up in person to make the exchange. Like Craigslist and any other online selling platforms, letgo runs the risk of fraud and scams like false checks and fraudulent money wiring. Be sure to meet in public places, bring a buddy, and use cash for transactions to maintain safety. The company outlines safety practices on its website and has a policy requiring users to verify their identity over email.\n\nEverybody's chasing Tesla for electric cars at CES\n\n4. OfferUp\n\nLike letgo, OfferUp connects buyers and sellers through its app, which it claims is the largest mobile-only marketplace of its kind. Upload photos of products to the service and use the app's chat feature to arrange a meet-up and sale. Like other classified services, it runs the risk of scams and safety issues when users meet up to make sales and has a number of safety tips on its website to decrease these risks. The app offers users the option to verify their identity through their state ID and Facebook log in. The company is exploring ways to make money through the app, which is free in the Google Play and Apple App stores, and was valued at $1.2 billion by recent estimates.\n\n5. AptDeco\n\nTrade in old furniture using online listing service and app AptDeco. The app allows users to advertise their products, and helps them edit the listing to make the photo and description more appealing. Once the item sells, AptDeco takes a commission at a set rate of 23% of the sale and takes care of the delivery for an extra fee from the buyer.
The Justice Department on Tuesday said it's filed an appeal against a case brought by the state of California, and is seeking a direct review in the U.S. Supreme Court, after a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It defies both law and common sense for DACA-an entirely discretionary non-enforcement policy that was implemented unilaterally by the last administration after Congress rejected similar legislative proposals and courts invalidated the similar DAPA policy-to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in San Francisco, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a statement.
Asian markets lacked direction Wednesday as traders grappled with the uncertainties about the policies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose inauguration looms.\n\nWhat will his inauguration speech be on Friday? asked Andrew Bresler, a director at Saxo Capital Markets. And [what] will his [first] 100 days will look like?\n\nTraders are focused on how Trump tackles China in his first week and whether he labels the country a currency manipulator, Bresler added.\n\nThere is so much uncertainty, said Alex Furber, sales trader at CMC Markets. The prospect of [a] trade war...no one really knows what that is going to look like...how much damage that will do to China.\n\nMarkets were struggling for a direction, either to stick to risk assets or go into safety, Furber said.\n\nJapan's Nikkei NIK, +1.01% turned positive after spending most of the morning in the redâ€” it closed up 0.4%. This is as the yen USDJPY, +0.03% fell further during Asian trade; it was last down 0.7% against the dollar. A weak yen makes the country's exporters more competitive.\n\nKorea's Kospi 180721, +0.61% closed down 0.1% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -0.73% finished the day down 0.4%.\n\nThe key focal point has been paring back on the global reflation tradeâ€¦that has really been unwound, said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG.\n\nIn an interview Friday with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said the U.S. dollar was already too strong, in part because China holds down its currency, the yuan.\n\n[Donald Trump] has taken a very, very unpresidential step [of] talking down the currency, said Weston. The market has taken it to heart.\n\nElsewhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a strong defense of global trade on Tuesday at the Davos gathering, curiously--some say--positioning Xi as the bigger advocate of economic orthodoxy, including globalization.\n\nThe U.S. share market was closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King holiday. U.S. share traders had their first chance to react to Mr. Trump's WSJ interview on Tuesday, and promptly sold off the market.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% fell 0.3% on Tuesday. The bigger impact was seen in financial stocks in the U.S. thanks to a drop in the yield on the 10-year Treasury notes, with the S&P 500 financials sub index sinking 2.3% overnight.\n\nHigher long-term yields tend to improve profits at lenders, which has boosted financial shares in the S&P 500 by 18% from Nov. 8 through to Friday's close.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield settled at 2.327% Tuesday, down from 2.38% Friday.\n\nThis decline in financials was felt in Australia Wednesday. The nation's four biggest banks--which make up about one-third of the weighting of the ASX 200--collectively knocked more than 12 points off the index.\n\nWestpac Banking Corp. WBC, -0.93% and Australia & New Zealand Banking Group ANZ, -0.81% each lost 1%, Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA, -1.56% fell 0.8% and National Australia Bank NAB, -0.88% was 0.7% lower. That offset gains among energy stocks as oil prices ticked higher in Asia.\n\nGains in banking shares also helped Hong Kong's Hang Seng index HSI, +1.28% breach the psychologically significant 23,000 mark Wednesday, with the benchmark closing up 1.1% on the day.\n\nFinancials led the Hong Kong gains, getting a lift today from a Morgan Stanley upgrade of the sector on Tuesday after market close. The broker said higher rates in the U.S. should aid net interest margins at Hong Kong lenders. BOC Hong Kong gained 3.1% Wednesday and Hang Seng Bank closed up 2.1%.\n\nBlue chips in Shanghai rose early Wednesday after the central bank injected massive liquidity into the market. The People's Bank of China put a net 270 billion Chinese yuan (US$39 billion) into the domestic money market.\n\nThis was done to address continued nervousness about the domestic share market following a sharp intra-day sell-off on Monday, and as regulators picked up the pace of approvals for initial public offerings. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.51% was up 0.1%. The Shenzhen Composite, however, slipped 0.5%.\n\nThe growth of home prices in China slowed in December from the month before, as a raft of property controls start to bite. The average price of new homes in 70 cities rose 0.3% in December from November, according to calculations by The Wall Street Journal based on data released Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics. That compares with a 0.6% gain in November.\n\nOn a yearly basis, average new home prices rose 10.8% in December, compared with a 10.4% gain in November.
It's a tough Monday morning for Chicago Bears place kicker Cody Parkey â€” but at least he's being compensated for it.\n\nThe kicker missed a late 43-yard field goal that would have won Sunday's wild-card-round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, ending his overachieving team's bid to advance in the playoffs and toward its first Super Bowl appearance since 2007. The missed field goal has already been called among [the] most brutal in NFL playoff history. The kick looked like a winner until its leftward drift resulted in its hitting the upright, then the crossbar, drawing gasps from the crowd.\n\nParkey, 26 and in his first season with Chicago, told reporters after the game: It's one of the worst feelings in the world to let your team down, so I feel terrible. I'm going to continue to put things in perspective and just put my best foot forward, and sleep at night knowing I did everything in my power. Speaking of his teammates, he added, Every single one of them said they've got my back and love me.\n\nDon't miss: 'Venmo us!' Why more charities may soon be asking for your money with this app\n\nEagles fans, however, were elated that he'd missed â€” and appreciative. Immediately after the game they began rewarding (or, you might say, taunting) Parkey by sending him money via the payment app Venmo. One dollar per point you left on the board, wrote one Eagles fan in a note accompanying a payment to Parkey. Thank you for sucking! Go birds! wrote another.\n\nOther messages consisted entirely of eagle and football emoji. The payment app does not show payment amounts, only that a payment was made. Notes describing payments can be seen by anyone using the app unless users make them private.\n\nParkey's profile was public but has since been made private, and Venmo does not show the total number of payments made for a particular reason, even if the person in question has privacy settings on public.\n\nSavvy Venmo users were quick to cash in on the kicker's misfortune. One user name was opportunistically changed to Cody Parkey PleaseHelpMePayForSchool and another became Not Cody Parkey But Need Beer Money. By Monday morning, dozens of fake Cody Parkeys had flooded the platform.\n\nThe phenomenon underscores the facts that Venmo transactions are entirely public unless users change their privacy settings and that users can easily look up anyone on the platform and see their payment history.\n\nIn fact, many people use the app to keep tabs on exes or on public figures. It's another reminder of the importance of making your Venmo account private â€” not least if you're an NFL kicker. The platform makes a massive amount of data about users' lives public by default, a report released in July found.\n\nMeanwhile, even Bears fans got busy directing funds to another cause: getting rid of Parkey. Bears fans set up a GoFundMe page (which is now inactive) with the goal of buying out the remainder of Parkey's reported four-year, $15 million contract.\n\nAlso see:Is my golfing buddy the cheapest guy in America? He asked me to Venmo him $1.50\n\nThe platform was previously investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for misleading users about the fact that they needed to change two separate privacy settings to make their transactions completely private. The company reached a settlement with the FTC.\n\nAs the backlash against Venmo's privacy policy continues, the company has added push notifications to alert users as to how they can make certain transactions private. Venmo did not immediately respond to a MarketWatch request for comment but has said in the past that it added privacy options in response to the investigation.\n\nTo make your Venmo account private, go to settings and click privacy. Under the privacy setting, users can select private as a default privacy setting for all future payments. There is an option to make all past transactions private as well, which you should probably do â€” unless you're trying to get paid for a missed field goal.
Karen Pence, wife of VP Mike Pence since 1985, said Tuesday that she's excited to get back to doing what she loves to do â€” teach!\n\nWhat the second lady didn't mention is she'll be working under a strict biblical morality policy, which is pretty specific about who's allowed at the school.\n\nHere's a snippet from the application:\n\n 'Moral misconduct which violates the bona fide occupational qualifications for employees includes, but is not limited to, such behaviors as the following: heterosexual activity outside of marriage (e.g., premarital sex, cohabitation, extramarital sex), homosexual or lesbian sexual activity, polygamy, transgender identity, any other violation of the unique roles of male and female, sexual harassment, use or viewing of pornographic material or websites.' \n\nThe school also asks applicants to pledge to live a personal life of moral purity by signing off on sections, including one that says God intended sexual acts occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other.\n\nThose are just some of the guidelines laid out by Immanuel Christian School, a private K-8 school just outside of Washington, D.C., where Pence had previously worked for many years.\n\nPerhaps this shouldn't come as a surprise, considering the Pences have long been known for their staunch religious convictions.\n\nRegardless, her decision was widely criticized.\n\nWhy not teach at a school that welcomes everyone, instead of choosing one that won't serve LGBTQ kids, kids of LGBTQ parents? JoDee Winterhof of the Human Rights Campaign told HuffPost in a statement. The Pences never seem to miss an opportunity to show their public service only extends to some.\n\nMore of the same on Twitter:\n\nKara Brooks, a spokeswoman for Pence, responded to the backlash.\n\nIt's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, Brooks told HuffPo in a statement.
Sallie Krawcheck wants to see a particular brand of feminism in 2017. She calls it financial feminism.\n\nFormer Wall Street standout Krawcheck, who was vocal about the intersection of politics, money and culture throughout the presidential campaign â€” she told an interviewer before the election that Donald Trump's candidacy could be one of the best things that's ever happened for feminists â€” hasn't changed that tune in 2017.\n\nEarlier this month, with Trump's inauguration nearing, she wrote to members of digital investment advisory service Ellevest that women control $5 trillion of investible assets, jointly control another $6 trillion of investible assets and make up half of the workforce. And today we have more options than ever for using that power.\n\nKrawcheck is CEO and co-founder of Ellevest, which she aims to grow by targeting women, raising their financial profiles in the meantime. She is also promoting a book, Own It, released Jan. 17, that merges her personal experience with viewpoints on feminism, work, and how the financial services industry should serve women.\n\nCan Wall Street close this gender gap?\n\nIn conversations with MarketWatch, she expressed frustration with a male-dominated industry she says has a blind spot for women, tailoring messaging and products to men. An example: product descriptions that focus on how they beat or outperform the market rather than build wealth.\n\nWomen would like to make sure there is enough money to pay for [their child's] college, and not whether their portfolio is doing better than somebody else's, Krawcheck told MarketWatch. It's not a coincidence that an opportunity like Ellevest exists.\n\nFrom Wall Street to entrepreneurship\n\nKrawcheck grew up in Charleston, S.C., a straight-A student whose obsession with grades helped her earn the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's prestigious Morehead-Cain Scholarship. But when she graduated, she first aimed for journalism, not finance.\n\nI tried to get a job at Time magazine, she said. They would not give me one, so I applied for a job on Wall Street.\n\nKrawcheck eventually cut her Wall Street teeth at Salomon Brothers, briefly overlapping with Michael Lewis, who later described his tenure there in Liar's Poker. (In the book, Lewis describes scenes of misogyny and sexism at the firm; Krawcheck does the same in hers.)\n\nKrawcheck quit after three years to pursue an M.B.A. at Columbia University. At a commencement speech some two decades later, she told the crowd about the rejection letters she received after applying for Wall Street jobs â€” three, she recalled, just from Lehman Brothers â€” upon graduating from business school.\n\nShe accepted the only offer she got, covering the life insurance industry for Sanford Bernstein for half of my old salary and at a lower level of seniority.\n\nThen she began to climb, earning acclaim as she progressed: When she was appointed CEO of Citi's C, +0.33% new Smith Barney unit, Time listed her in its 2002 list of Global Influentials. Fortune named her Most Influential Person Under the Age of 40.\n\nShe became CFO of Citigroup in 2004 and CEO of Citi's wealth management business in 2007.\n\nKrawcheck, now 52, was fired from Citigroup in September 2008 over an argument with then-CEO Vikram Pandit in which she felt the company should compensate clients who lost money after following the bank's investment advice.\n\nIn 2009, she was hired to run Bank of America's BAC, +2.61% Merrill Lynch advisory unit, but was fired by new CEO Brian Moynihan as part of a restructuring two years later.\n\nShe contemplated a move to regulation, with stints as a consultant working with leaders in Washington, D.C., in the wake of the financial crisis. But in 2013 she bought 85 Broads, a network of professional women that aims to help women advance in the workplace, both for themselves and the greater good and is now called Ellevate.\n\nWith a background in financial services and a passion for improving women's financial lives, Krawcheck says it was natural for her to start a digital adviser geared specifically toward them. Ellevest officially launched in May.\n\nAnd she views her high-profile firings as part of the life of a Wall Street executive. At a conversation with Columbia students not long after her dismissal by Moynihan, she answered questions about banking, the financial crisis, women on the Street and her career without euphemisms or jargon. Life, she said, goes on.\n\nClosing the investment gap\n\nKrawcheck, a prolific writer, speaker and social media maven, understands the power of the message. She writes regularly for news sites, her columns are widely shared via LinkedIn, and Ellevest clients regularly get her missives on personal finance, feminism and tips on how to ask for a raise.\n\nShe asserts that a lack of gender diversity on Wall Street is a big reason the financial services industry doesn't serve women as well as it should. The industry has also noted this: In a 2014 white paper, CFP Board CEO Kevin R. Keller wrote that the needs [of consumers] will go unmet unless the population of CFP professionals more closely reflects the demographics of the public they serve.\n\nOnly 23% of financial advisers with the Certified Financial Planner designation are women, according to Cerulli Associates, a research firm that specializes in global asset management.\n\nMeanwhile, women control more than half of U.S. personal wealth â€” but an average woman's retirement account is just over half that of an average man's, according to BMO Wealth Institute, partly because women earn less during their lifetimes, accumulate more debt, live longer and suffer more financially after divorces.\n\nWomen are also more likely to take career breaks to start a family or care for a family member, something Krawcheck says comes with a price tag higher than many realize â€” and that they often neglect to calculate, with unforgiving consequences.\n\nAccording to the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute, career breaks of just a few years can cost a worker hundreds of thousands of dollars due to a combination of lost wages, lost retirement, lost Social Security contributions and lost future wage growth.\n\nIf you are earning $85,000 a year, and want to take a 2-year career break, most women assume the cost of such a break is $170,000, Krawcheck said. The right answer is it's more than a $1 million.â€¦When you calculate the true cost of a career break, you might just want to get a babysitter. The worst decision you make is to make a decision with poor information.\n\nCareer breaks â€” and other decisions, such as failures to ask for promotions or raises â€” lead to financial gaps that leave women at a disadvantage, according to Krawcheck, who says she wants to help women make choices that put them on a stronger footing.\n\nI believe this fully and have seen it in action: Money is power, and women will not be fully equal with men until we are financially equal with men, she said.\n\nA different kind of robo adviser\n\nEllevest is a robo adviser designed specifically for women, taking into account likely gaps in pay and investment in recommending products and strategies. Rather than offering only a choice of portfolios in which to invest, Krawcheck says, we put together a full financial plan together based on a woman's goal, combining data including their education, age, salary, ZIP Code and assets.\n\nTheir software also estimates the effect of career breaks on their planning. We often have to deliver bad news to investors, she said.\n\nA sample view of the Ellevest interface. Elllevest\n\nMembers can buy investment products directly through Ellevest or use the advice with their own advisers. When customers appear to fall behind on savings goals, Ellevest nudges them to get back on track, telling them how to adjust.\n\nEllevest is now available to anyone with a computer and a bank account. It is still relatively small, with 1,800 clients and $9 million under management, according to a Jan. 5 regulatory filing.\n\nKrawcheck wants Ellevest, which has secured $19 million in funding, to become the go-to place for investment advice for women. She hopes to do that in part by distinguishing Ellevest from what she thinks is a mistaken stereotype of the robo adviser. I've never been a fan of the term, she said.\n\nWhile individual clients' investment needs and goals are analyzed by computer, she says, the products offered are hand-picked. (In Ellevest's case, the hand belongs to Chief Investment Officer Sylvia Kwan, who has a Ph.D. in engineering economic systems from Stanford University and manages her family's $22 million for Simply Smart Asset Management.)\n\nI think it's dismissive of what these digital investment platforms do, Krawcheck said. The sense feels like there is no human engagement.\n\nBut she also says the ease of using automated platforms helps all investors get started and choose products that meet their goals â€” and says Ellevest goes further by using terminology that is jargon-free and geared toward individual goals.\n\nThat, she hopes, will help customers overcome conditioning that tells women personal money management is man's business â€” which cost them money if that leads them to put off investments.\n\nWealth management in the U.S. is a $30 trillion industry, Krawcheck said. Firms that provide value and differentiation are capable of massive scale and impact.\n\nStill, their success â€” as is the case with any adviser â€” will ultimately be determined by their ability to attract clients. Morningstar senior equity analyst Michael Wong believes that with their current fee structures, robo advisers need between $16 billion and $40 billion in assets under management to break even. (Morningstar is an investor in Ellevest.)\n\nBetterment and Wealthfront, two early robo advisers, have about $6 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Their growth slowed when giants Vanguard and Schwab decided to offer their own platforms at even lower fees.\n\nEllevest's fees, meanwhile, at 0.5% of assets under management â€” which are in addition to the expenses associated with whatever products you buy â€” are higher than what some rivals charge, though lower than a traditional adviser's fee.\n\nPeople are telling me: 'There are so many digital advisers, you can't be successful,' said Krawcheck. But we have a gender investment gap. If women invested at the same level as men, I'd be doing something else.
The best investment idea of 2018 may also be the market's least exciting.\n\nCash, long ignored by investors amid a multiyear bull market in stocks, as well as a decadelong rotation into bonds, has found some supporters who view it as one of the few risk-free options in a market that otherwise seems to offer nothing but risk and lofty prices.\n\nThe views come at a time when valuation concerns are growing around both stocks and bonds. Equities have been on a tear for years, and last year major indexes hit a record number of all-time highs amid a backdrop bereft of volatility or significant pullbacks. Although few are forecasting a bull-market-killing recession, the current environment suggests less upside potential in stocks, along with the potential for more downside. At the same time, bond prices are expected to extend their downtrend, pushing yields which move inversely higher, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.\n\nIt's hard to argue that 2017's Goldilocks marketsâ€”characterized by extremely low volatility, rebounding global growth, constructive monetary policy, low inflation and loose financial conditionsâ€”has not given way to 2018's euphoric markets, wrote Lisa Shalett, head of investment and portfolio strategies at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. Against this backdrop of an increasingly pricey U.S. equity market, and extremely rich credit market and rising global rates, the Global Investment Committee is focusing more on cash as a critical asset class for 2018.\n\nThe rally seen in stocks over 2017 has led to a surge in bullish sentiment, which some analysts have cautioned could represent a contrary warning signal, though others have said optimism market hasn't yet reached the level of euphoria, a stage that is considered a killer of bull markets.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. stocks are among the most expensive in the world, based on a variety of valuation metrics. Vincent Deluard, head of global macro strategy at INTL FCStone Financial, recently noted that based on the closely watched price-to-sales measure, U.S. equities are already more overvalued than they were during the internet bubble.\n\nChart courtesy INTL FCStone Financial\n\nDeluard called 2018 the year of cash and said from a strategic allocation perspective, the most important decision for investors in 2018 may be to overweight cash, at the expense of fixed income.\n\nBond yields have been rising steadily ever since the U.S. 10 Year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% hit a record-low yield of 1.36% in July 2016. Since then, it has moved up to 2.63%, and yields are expected to continue rising alongside interest rates. Goldman Sachs expects the 10-year yield to end 2018 at 2.9%, and for it to continue climbing for the foreseeable future, hitting 3.3% in 2019 and 3.5% in 2020. This would mean a decline in the price of the 10-year over the next three years, as prices and yields move inversely to each other.\n\nA particular concern for bond investors is the expectation that the Treasury Department could issue $1 trillion of debt in 2018, almost double the amount seen in 2017.\n\nWith valuations of both stocks and credit-linked bonds near historic extremes, the margin of error for data or sentiment disappointments is low. It's increasingly important for investors to build hedges into their portfolios that could cushion a normalization of volatility, wrote Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's Shalett.\n\nAside from the obvious advantage of cash in providing instant liquidity, an ability to take advantage of correction and portfolio ballast against rising volatility, we note that after a long and frustrating decade, cash yields are more attractive in an absolute sense.\n\nHow Millennials Get Trapped by a Robust Stock Market\n\nShalett referred to the federal-funds rate and the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate. Both are now safely above zero, she wrote, adding that the two-year Treasury yield is around 2% TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , marking the first time since 2009 that the real yieldâ€”the nominal yield adjusted for inflationâ€”is positive.\n\nSo far, investors don't seem to be taking these views to heart. According to the latest BofA Merrill Lynch fund manager survey, the average cash position in portfolios fell to a five-year low of 4.4%. Equity allocation hit a two-year high of 55%. Such positioning has been echoed across Wall Street: TD Ameritrade recently reported that its clients ended 2017 with market exposure at all-time highs, while cash balances for Charles Schwab clients reached their lowest level on record in the third quarter, according to Morgan Stanley, which wrote that retail investors can't stay away from stocks.\n\nOn average, analysts expect the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% to end the year at 2,819, a level that is below where the benchmark index closed on Monday.\n\nDespite the slight upside implied by that target, other major firms continue to be supportive of equities. J.P. Morgan, in the bank's latest global asset allocation report, has an underweight rating on cash, giving it an active weight of negative 5%. It recommended investors should remain strongly overweight equities near term funded by underweights in government bonds and cash.
Gold prices logged their largest one-day loss of the year on Thursday as the dollar gained on the combination of inaction on interest rates from the European Central Bank and relatively hawkish comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.\n\nGold for February delivery US:GCG7 fell $10.60, or 0.9%, to settle at $1,201.50 an ounce. That marked the largest dollar and percentage loss for a single session so far in 2017. Prices had continued to trade lower after the ECB released its policy statement. Gold retreated on Wednesday as well, but the contract had climbed 1.4% Tuesday to finish at its highest level since Nov. 17, according to FactSet data.\n\nMarch silver US:SIH7 unraveled by 27.2 cents, or 1.6%, to $17.002 an ounce.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.41% , meanwhile, gained 0.5%. Gold and the dollar typically trade inversely because a stronger greenback can erode demand by making commodities pegged to the buck, including metals, more expensive to buyers using other monetary units.\n\nAs for European policy, the expected, policy inaction comes as the ECB last month decided to extend its bond-buying program through the end of 2017. In postmeeting comments, the ECB's Mario Draghi said he is ready to expand quantitative easing to boost the economy if needed.\n\nReadECB live blog recap: Mario Draghi sees no sign of sustained inflation pickup\n\nThe U.S. dollar began to climb on Wednesday after Yellen said she expects Fed-controlled interest rates to rise a few times a year through 2019. She also said the central bank was nearing its goals for inflation and employment and that it makes sense to reduce the central bank's level of monetary support. Higher interest rates tend to dull demand for gold which doesn't bear a yield.\n\nThe Fed's stance contrasts with central banks elsewhere, including the ECB.\n\nData Thursday showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in January, and the number of workers being laid off each week has plunged again back to a more-than-40-year low.\n\nThe U.S. economic data released Thursday favors the Fed, which wants increase the interest rate this year on the back of solid economic growth, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets.\n\n 'We are still bullish on gold in the longer term as [Trump] is the machine of uncertainty which will keep investors on the edge.'  â€” Naeem Aslam, ThinkMarkets\n\nThis is impacting the gold price because the dollar has picked up steam again, he said. But we are still bullish on gold in the longer term as [Trump] is the machine of uncertainty which will keep investors on the edge.\n\nGold futures trade just about 0.4% higher week to date as investors show caution ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration scheduled for Friday, especially after Trump recently suggested he favored a weaker dollar.\n\nRead:Trump is waving adios to the longstanding 'strong dollar policy'\n\nOne must be fully cognizant that the uncertainty surrounding this new administration will continue at least until inauguration. And even though that is [not far] away, it will be the first seven days, [and then] the first 30 days of a new Trump administration before we are able to see what transformations and policies will be implemented, as well as a much clearer timeline as to how these new policies and programs will unfold, said Gary Wagner of Thegoldforecast.com.\n\nThe dollar had rallied and gold wavered in the immediate wake of Trump's election win on speculation he would usher in potentially inflationary pro-growth policies. The dollar rallied to a 14-year high but has since retreated, helping gold to rebound as the market grew weary waiting on details.\n\nRead:Gold prices could soar if Donald Trump says any one of these five things\n\nOther metals traded on Comex ended mostly lower, with April platinum US:PLJ7 down $15.50, or 1.6%, at $956.40 an ounce and March copper US:HGH7 losing less than a penny, or 0.2%, to $2.611 a pound. March palladium US:PAH7 settled little changed, up 15 cents at $751.15 an ounce.
If the Federal Reserve had mechanically followed the simple mathematical rule for setting interest rates developed by Stanford University economist John Taylor, 2.5 million more Americans would be out of work today, said Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari on Thursday.\n\nOver the past five years, Kashkari said the Taylor rule would have called at times for much higher interest rates, almost has high as 3% over some periods, while the Fed kept them close to zero.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) â€” Four interest-rate increases this year â€” the Federal Reserve's benchmark forecast â€” would push the U.S. economy into a recession, said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Alpha Economic Foresights.\n\nThe U.S. central bank is ignoring the recessionary signal being sent by the manufacturing sector, just as it did in the prior two sharp economic downturns in 2000 and 2007, Bethune said in a research note to clients sent on Thursday.\n\nThe manufacturing sector is in recession, a recession that is in the process of deepening as we speak, Bethune said.\n\nThe longer this manufacturing/mining recession persists, the higher the probability of a broader economy-wide recession, he noted.\n\nOn Monday, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index slipped to 48.2% in December from 48.6% in the prior month. That's the lowest reading since the last month of the Great Recession. Readings under 50% indicate more companies are shrinking instead of expanding.\n\nRead more: U.S. manufacturers end 2015 on sour note, ISM finds\n\nEither the manufacturing sector recovers soon or the services sector slows down considerably, Bethune said.\n\nThe likelihood of the former is low, Bethune said.\n\nThe economist, who also teaches at Tufts University, said the Fed's median forecast of a pickup in growth and inflation this year is not credible.\n\nThe Fed is forecasting growth picks up to a 2.4% rate in 2016 from 2.1% in 2015. Inflation is expected to jump to average 1.6% in the fourth quarter of this year from a 0.4% rate last year.\n\nFed policy is already tight given the recent rise in the dollar, he added.
It's going to be a challenging year for home buyers in 2019: They will continue to compete for a short supply of homes. Home prices and mortgage rates are likely to keep moving upward, bruising affordability.\n\nBut 2019 is likely to bring some welcome developments, too, for buyers and mortgage borrowers. Builders are constructing more entry-level homes, lenders are gradually making it easier to qualify for a loan, and first-time home buyers are getting the attention they deserve.\n\nHere are nine housing and mortgage trends to watch for in 2019.\n\n1. Wanted: More homes for sale\n\nReal estate has been a seller's market for more than six years, meaning that there are more would-be buyers than homes for sale, sliding the balance of negotiating power in sellers' direction. It will remain a seller's market in 2019.\n\nA prolonged seller's market is not the ideal situation for home buyers. But the forecast contains some hope: The number of homes for sale is expected to rise. The problem is that the pent-up demand is still expected to continue to exceed supply, even with more homes for sale.\n\nRealtor.com's forecast sums it up this way: While the situation is not getting worse for buyers, it's also not improving notably in the majority of markets.\n\nHow bad is the shortage? Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored enterprise that provides capital to the mortgage market, estimates that 370,000 fewer homes were built in 2017 than were needed to satisfy demand resulting from population growth. Until construction ramps up, housing costs will likely continue rising above income, constricting household formation and preventing homeownership for millions of potential households, Freddie Mac concludes.\n\n2. Home prices will keep going up\n\nHome prices are expected to deliver a good news, bad news year in 2019.\n\nFirst, the bad news: Home prices are predicted to keep rising. The good news is that most forecasters believe prices won't rise as fast in 2019 as they did in 2018.\n\nHome price appreciation will slow down â€” the days of easy price gains are coming to an end â€” but prices will continue to rise, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. NAR predicts that existing home prices will rise 2.5% in 2019, to a median of $265,200, compared with a 4.7% rise in 2018, to $258,700.\n\nDon't miss:What the Fed's rate hike will mean for America's wavering housing market\n\nCoreLogic and Realtor.com also predict a slowdown in sale prices of existing homes in 2019.\n\nHome price appreciation has slowed in 2018, says Frank Nothaft, chief economist for CoreLogic. Rising prices and interest rates have reduced home buyer activity and led to a gradual slowing in appreciation, he wrote in a market commentary.\n\nNot everyone believes the pace of home prices will slow in 2019. One outlier is Fannie Mae, another government-sponsored enterprise. It forecasts that median prices for existing homes will go up 4.7% in 2019, compared with 4.5% in 2018. (The housing market is big, and Fannie Mae, NAR and other market participants don't always end up with the same estimates.)\n\n3. Mortgage rates will continue rising\n\nFrom the beginning of 2018 to mid-December, 30-year fixed mortgage rates went up a little less than three-quarters of a percentage point, to around 4.75%. Forecasters expect mortgage rates to rise again in 2019 â€” but at a slower pace.\n\nFreddie Mac expects the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to rise half a percentage point in 2019, and the National Association of Realtors predicts a rise of 0.4 percentage point. Fannie Mae's forecast is for an increase of just 0.1 percentage point.\n\nKeep in mind that these are predictions about where mortgage rates will end this year and end next year. In between, mortgage rates can bounce up and down.\n\nFor example, in NerdWallet's daily mortgage rate survey, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage started the year averaging 4.09%. On Nov. 9, the average hit its high for the year at 5.09% â€” exactly 1 percentage point higher. Then it fell more than a quarter of a percentage point in one month.\n\n4. Affordability still a concern\n\nAs home prices and mortgage rates rise in tandem, home buyers find it harder to afford homes.\n\nWe do worry about affordability, particularly in some areas that have lower inventory of homes for sale, says Randy Hopper, senior vice president of home lending for Navy Federal Credit Union. The places with low inventory tend to be places where home prices rise fastest, as the demand for homes exceeds supply.\n\nHopper says a gradual rise in mortgage rates won't cause most prospective buyers to give up on homeownership. On a $300,000 home, an increase of a quarter or a half percentage point is only going to impact the payment by between $75 and $100 a month, he says, which isn't insignificant, but it's not necessarily something that impacts the buying decision.\n\nDanielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com, says many markets are reaching the point where a typical home price is bumping up against affordability limits. She believes prices will eventually slow their increases to fall back in line with incomes. In 2019, she expects to see big sales increases in more-affordable areas such as El Paso, Texas; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\n5. New homes get smaller\n\nFrom a home buyer's perspective, most markets need more houses for sale, and they need to be on the affordable end of the price scale. After all, many first-timers buy starter homes instead of forever homes, with prices below the area's median. There are signs that home builders are responding by building smaller, more affordable homes.\n\nContinuing a multiyear trend, new single-family home size decreased during the third quarter of 2018, wrote Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, in a November blog post. New home size has been falling over the last three years due to an incremental move to additional entry-level home construction.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median size of single-family homes started in the third quarter of 2018 was 2,320 square feet. That's 4.9% smaller than the median size of new homes three years earlier, at 2,440 square feet.\n\nHopper says Navy Federal's members typically shop for homes costing less than $300,000 â€” and they like to buy new homes. He says he's encouraged that builders are focusing on these customers.\n\nI think for many years, the builders were focused on that $500,000-and-up market because the margins were healthier, he says. But they're starting to find now that there's so much pent-up demand in the lower-end-priced market that they can sustainably offer communities and new construction, and we've seen a lot of growth in that space.\n\nYear-over-year median prices for new homes began decelerating in spring 2018. At $309,700, the median price of a new home in October was 3.1% lower than the median new-home price 12 months earlier. But Fannie Mae and NAR predict that new-home prices will rise in 2019.\n\n6. First-time buyers dominate\n\nThe mortgage and real estate industries are focused on serving first-time home buyers, and for good reason: First-timers have dominated the mortgage market for the past 10 years, and their share today is still high, according to an Urban Institute report published this summer, which adds: We don't see this changing anytime soon.\n\nBefore the housing crisis, first-time home buyers took out about 40% of purchase mortgages, according to the institute. Lately the first-timer share has been about 60%.\n\nTian Liu, chief economist for Genworth Mortgage Insurance, says 80% of the growth in home sales in the past three years has come from first-time buyers, and the reason is simple: They represent years of pent-up demand.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2015, our estimate is that roughly 3 million first-time home buyers delayed buying a home, and they're reaching that age when they can no longer delay, Liu says. Their housing needs are really catching up with them. It doesn't feel right to be raising a family in a rental apartment. They want to own their place. So I think those drivers will be very significant for the next few years.\n\n7. Lending standards ease a little\n\nMortgage lenders learned an enduring lesson in the housing crisis a decade ago: Make sure borrowers can repay their loans. So lenders tightened mortgage standards, partly on their own and partly in response to a regulatory crackdown on risky mortgages. These changes made it harder to get a home loan.\n\nThe Urban Institute's Housing Finance Policy Center has argued that lenders overcorrected after lending too freely in the two or three years preceding the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nThere is evidence that lenders agree. Gradually, they have been relaxing lending standards.\n\nNot drastically, but looser than it was a year ago, says Matt Hackett, operations manager for Equity Now, a mortgage lender in New York City. It's not a floodgate scenario where people just start changing guidelines drastically.\n\nHe says he has observed that the relaxed standards come in the form of reduced documentation requirements, lower credit scores and bigger loan-to-value ratios (smaller down payments, basically).\n\nMortgage data provider Ellie Mae shows that the relaxation of credit standards indeed has been gradual. Average credit scores for home purchases slipped a bit in October (the latest data available) compared with 12 months earlier. Debt-to-income ratios, which measure borrowers' debt loads, nudged upward over the same period. That means they have higher debt and less flexibility to withstand financial emergencies.\n\n8. More borrowers choose ARMs\n\nIt's almost as predictable as May flowers following April showers: Whenever rates on fixed-rate mortgages go up, you'll see more borrowers opting for adjustable-rate mortgages. It happened in 2018 and it could continue into 2019.\n\nBorrowers choose ARMs because the initial rates on adjustables are lower than the rates on fixed-rate mortgages. This gives borrowers lower monthly payments in the first few years. ARM borrowers take the risk that their rates and monthly payments could climb when the rate-adjustment period begins.\n\nMore borrowers have been accepting the risk. In October, 8.2% of mortgages were ARMs, according to Ellie Mae; 12 months earlier, ARMs had a 5.5% share of mortgages.\n\nRising rates on fixed-rate mortgages aren't the only reason for adopting ARMs. Adjustables are most popular in the highest-priced housing markets, such as San Jose, according to CoreLogic.\n\nTaking out an ARM as rates rise, like now, could be a bad idea because borrowers might face higher mortgage payments once the annual loan adjustments kick in.\n\nBut getting an ARM can be a good strategy for borrowers who don't plan to overstay the initial interest rate. A 3/1 ARM, for example, has a lower introductory rate that lasts three years and then adjusts annually afterward. Someone getting, say, a 5/1 ARM is betting that they'll refinance or sell the home within five years or so, before the rate potentially adjusts upward.\n\n9. Overconfident sellers could struggle\n\nAs mentioned before, 2019 will remain a seller's market, where would-be buyers outnumber the supply of homes they can afford. But that doesn't mean home sellers can expect bidding wars from desperate buyers.\n\nThat's especially the case with people who are selling homes that are priced above the median for their local market, Realtor.com economist Hale says. First-time buyers dominate most markets, and they tend to shop for homes priced below the median. As a seller, Hale says, if you're in that above-median price point, you're going to have to price competitively and offer incentives for buyers.\n\nHale adds: Surprisingly, it's going to be more difficult for buyers and sellers in 2019. Especially for buyers looking for less expensive homes and sellers selling more expensive ones.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
U.S. stocks ended the day with substantial losses Wednesday. A combination of plunging crude-oil prices CLG26, +0.10% and hand-wringing over China's sluggish economy and fears about North Korea's nuclear capabilities unsettled investors. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve meeting minutes, released at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, showed some policy makers had reservations about raising interest rates. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% closed 26.39 points, or 1.31%, lower at 1,990. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38% fell 251.8 points, or 1.47%, to 16,906. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.27% ended the day down 55.67 points, or 1.14%, at 4,835.
Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday that monetary policy is in a good place and this will allow the central bank to take the time to assess the economy before making any more policy moves. Mester said the central bank could pause or even stop tightening now depending on inflation. She said that the two rate hikes penciled in by the central bank for 2019 could happen and that would be a good sign that the economy was performing well. Mester said she didn't support any slowdown in the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet but said if the economy weakened markedly that a change was possible. Pressed on whether she supported further rate hikes, Mester said she didn't have to vote now and would wait for more information.
Facebook Inc. and Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi Corp. are teaming up to launch a virtual-reality headset in China that would give the American tech giant a toehold in a growing market where its main business has long been blocked.\n\nThe two tech companies are working together to develop a VR headset sold only in China called Mi VR Standalone, Facebook said Monday. The new device is modeled after Facebook's Oculus Go, a previously announced $199 headset that the company plans to launch outside of China in early 2018.
European stock markets erased earlier gains and turned firmly lower on Thursday, yanked lower by a euro rally after the European Central Bank said eurozone growth was surprisingly strong and offered only limited pushback against the Trump administration's embrace of dollar weakness.\n\nWhat are markets doing?\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.40% fell 0.6% to end at 398.60, its lowest close since Jan. 17.\n\nGermany's DAX 30 index DAX, +1.23% slid 0.9% to 13,298.36, while France's CAC 40 index PX1, +0.13% moved 0.3% lower to 5,481.21.\n\nThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.25% dropped 0.4% to 7,615.84.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.03% jumped to an intraday high of $1.2537 from $1.2410 late Wednesday in New York, marking the first time the shared currency has traded above $1.25 since late 2014. It exchanged hands at $1.2485 at the time of the European market close.\n\nThe pound GBPUSD, -0.14% rose to $1.4266, compared with $1.4238 on Wednesday.\n\nWhat's driving the markets?\n\nThe euro shot higher after the ECB called the eurozone's economic growth robust and broad-based and said inflation has started to move closer to the bank's target of below, but close to 2%.\n\nECB President Mario Draghi did spell out concerns over the strengthening euro, saying the recent volatility represents a source of uncertainty and a risk to the region's growth outlook. He reiterated, however, that the bank doesn't target an exchange rate for competitive purposes, seen as a rebuke to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who in recent days have stated a weak dollar is good for U.S. trade.\n\nSee:Here's why Trump's weak-dollar policy is Mario Draghi's problem\n\nRead:ECB recap: Draghi offers warning on euro, but shared currency continues surge\n\nDraghi's comments were interpreted as an acknowledgment there's little the ECB can do to arrest the euro's rise in the near term. A stronger euro can hurt exports and weigh on inflation, potentially hurting the recovery. That's also why stocks headed lower after the euro jumped above $1.25.\n\nRead:Things are going GREAT in the eurozoneâ€”so why isn't the ECB raising rates?\n\nThe euro has moved significantly higher recently and is now up more than 4% against the dollar in 2018, adding to last year's 14% advance.\n\nThe ECB made no changes to its interest rates, keeping the deposit rate at a negative 0.4% and the refinancing rate at 0%. The bank also kept its forward guidance in place, saying rates will remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases.\n\nRegarding its quantitative easing program, the central bank reiterated the â‚¬30 billion-a-month bond-buying program is intended to run until the end of September or beyond if necessary.\n\nWhat are strategist saying?\n\nDespite the European Central Bank not changing its outlook or interest rates, the euro soared during today's lunchtime press conference. The market had expected Mario Draghi to come out and temper expectations by talking down the recent euro appreciation, as he has done in the past. However, he stated that the economy was vastly improving and the recovery was now 'robust and broad-based', which is far more positive language than he used last year, said Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, in a note.\n\nDraghi offered no clear hint whether the ECB would suddenly stop its asset purchases, extend them, or phase them out gradually. By admitting that this is part of the debate at the ECB, he opened the door for a sudden end of asset purchases in eight months from now, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, in a note.\n\nWhat's new in economic data?\n\nGerman business sentiment jumped in January, with the Ifo business climate index rising to 117.6 points from 117.2 in December. The reading beat economists' expectations of a slight decline to 117.0 and tied with November's print for an all-time high.\n\nWhat stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of Nordea Bank AB SE:NDASEK lost 4.2% after the Scandinavian bank posted a 43% drop in fourth-quarter profit.\n\nAryzta AG ARYN, -4.38% sank 21% after the Swiss baker company issued a profit warning, partly blaming Brexit-related pressures on its U.K. business.
Treasury yields rose Monday, following last week's volatile trading, as investors watched for progress in renewed trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.625% rose 2.3 basis points to 2.684%, from an intraday low of 2.634%. The 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.157% advanced 3.6 basis points to 2.524%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.377% was mostly unchanged at 2.977%. Bond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nHopes for trade tensions to ease come as U.S. and China conduct talks to end their longstanding trade dispute on Monday and Tuesday. Bloomberg reported that high-ranking Chinese Vice Premier Liu He unexpectedly made an appearance in the negotiations, giving a boost to what was initially scheduled as a meeting between midlevel officials. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% and DJIA, -0.39% were both up on Monday, dampening demand for haven assets like government paper.\n\nBoth sides have compelling reasons to act â€” China quite clearly is suffering from an economic slowdown, and [U.S. President] Donald Trump obviously fears that a nervous stock market could imperil his re-election, said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist for Horizon Investments, in a note.\n\nTrump has expressed optimism over negotiations, arguing that tariffs on China had brought it to the bargaining table. But both Beijing and Washington have refused to budge from their original stances since Trump last met Chinese President Xi Jinping in early December.\n\nIf a deal isn't reached, tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports are set to increase to 25% from 10% in early March. That would mark a serious escalation and add to the global economic headwinds facing both sides amid doubts over the durability of global growth.\n\nSee: Trump, China express optimism ahead of new round of trade talks\n\nThe U.S. government shutdown continued as Trump maintained his demands for funding of a border wall. He has floated the possibility of calling a national emergency to circumvent Congress and secure finances for the wall.\n\nMonday's yield rise appeared to accelerate after the Institute for Supply Management's services sector gauge for December fell to 57.6%, a five-month low, from 60.7% the previous month. Still, it's relative strength against the recent reading from the ISM's manufacturing gauge, suggests the U.S. services firms remains in better than health than their industrial peers. Any number above 50% indicates growth in activity.\n\nRead: Opinion: S&P 500 will climb 15% in 2019 â€” here's what to buy now\n\nThe key takeaway from today's report is that there is no reason to panic about an excessively rapid cooling of the U.S. economy. While policy headwinds and tighter financial conditions will slow the pace of growth in 2019, there is a lot of gray area between a 3% growth economy and an outright recession, wrote Jake McRobie, an analyst at Oxford Economics.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expected only one rate increase in 2019. This week will see plenty of speeches from senior Fed officials as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak again Thursday, after he said the central bank would take a more flexible approach to raising rates last Friday.
America's Powerball champs live in its tiniest state.\n\nResidents of Rhode Island have bought an average of 3.44 tickets per person for Powerball drawings since the last jackpot was won on Nov. 4, according to data crunched by consumer finance website ValuePenguin.\n\nThat's more than three times as many as those living in Washington state â€” even though winnings in that corner of the Pacific Northwest aren't subject to state income tax. Ticket sales there barely top one per resident. Connecticut and Tennessee (another tax-free state) may sell fewer per capita; the available information is not comprehensive.\n\nThe sales figures are through Wednesday, the date of the last drawing.\n\nThe data aren't broken down by drawing, but ticket sales tend to jump once a jackpot has topped $300 million without a winner, in turn pushing up the amount of potential winnings, according to Rebecca Wessell, a strategy analyst at New York Cityâ€“based ValuePenguin.\n\nIf a $300 million jackpot goes unclaimed, for example, the size of the pot has climbed an average of 42% since 2002, or another $120 million, she said.\n\n No matter how may people buy tickets, the odds of nailing all six numbers stay the same: 1 in 292 million. \n\nNo one hit the jackpot in the last drawing â€” estimated at $500 million â€” on Wednesday. Since then, the estimated pot has swollen by 80%, or $400 million, to a record $900 million by midday Saturday, with almost half a day still left to buy tickets.\n\nNo matter how may people buy tickets, the odds of nailing all six numbers stay the same: 1 in 292 million. A pot is divided among how ever many winning tickets there are.\n\nTickets are sold in 44 states plus Washington, D.C.; Puerto Rico; and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Saturday's drawing will be held at 10:59 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nHere's how ticket sales break down by state. It's not clear why there's such a range; the initial reaction of a spokeswoman for Rhode Island Lottery was one of puzzlement, and Wessell suggested it could be influenced by local news coverage and marketing efforts.\n\nState taxes don't seem to be an obvious explanation; some that don't levy a tax are among those selling the most per capita, while others with the same taxation policy are toward the bottom. Nor do the numbers appear to be influenced by out-of-staters; none of the states around Rhode Island are among the six states that don't sell Powerball tickets.
We are now seeing a so-called volatility squeeze in the benchmark S&P 500 Index. In September, we had a similar situation, as noted by the arrows in this chart.\n\nSuch squeezes tend to precede moves higher in the broader market. (A volatility squeeze occurs when the volatility of a stock falls below recent levels.) Indeed, the market delivered an explosive rally shortly after the volatility squeeze in September. But as markets often do, it tested our nerves by falling sharply at first, tagging its upward sloping 200-day moving average. The big push came after Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nSo the question is: Will stocks rise after the current volatility squeeze?\n\n Even though I expect 2017 to be an up year for stocks, it may turn out to be more volatile, with bigger swings up and down. \n\nMy answer is: most likely. Corrections can happen at any time, but to get a real bear market we need a recession, and no recession is in sight for the U.S. economy in 2017. A recession may very well happen during the first term of the Trump presidency, since the present economic expansion will be eight years long (or 96 months) this June. After that point, there would have been only two expansions longer than 96 months: March 1991 to March 2001 (120 months) and February 1961 to December 1969 (106 months; please see this table).\n\nIt is always possible that Trump will break the record and manage to engineer the longest economic expansion in history, surpassing 120 months. It is also possible that his policies misfire â€” such as starting a trade war with China â€” cutting the present economic expansion short. Trump will be the least predictable U.S. president in history, so we just don't know what might happen, but we have to be mindful of the statistical distribution of recessions listed in the table, below. Based on all the historical data, I think the probability of a recession during Trump's first term is close to 100%.\n\nThis history of economic cycles implies concerns for 2018 and 2019. In 2017, we are likely to see a stock market rally. Stocks are likely to break out â€” hopefully without a dive first â€” as earnings growth for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% will resume after six quarters of flat-to-slightly-declining earnings. If earnings climb, stocks usually go up too, even though this situation is never a linear relationship.\n\nWatch senators' heated exchange at the Mnuchin hearing\n\nTaking a cue from market sectors, the Nasdaq 100 NDX, -3.13% made an all-time high last week (see chart). This suggests that investors' appetite for risk is alive and well. This time the move in the Nasdaq 100 is very different than the move that culminated in the technology bust of 2000, as today it is driven by earnings. While the technology sector did initially underperform when the Trumpnado hit the stock market right after the election (denoted in the dip at the end in the relative chart here), that appears to have ended as the relative action of the Nasdaq 100 compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has now turned up.\n\nThe technology sector, when it's not crashing 2000-style, tends to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average over time as its member companies grow faster; so the present renewed leadership of the Nasdaq 100 is a positive sign for the stock market, and I would certainly be looking for the broader market (as represented by the S&P 500) to make new highs too.\n\nOn a different note, even though I expect 2017 to be an up year for stocks, I think it may turn out to be more volatile overall, with bigger swings up and down. Trump is hell-bent on making many rapid and abrupt changes, which are likely to rock share prices. He is also the first president to use his Twitter TWTR, -4.96% account as a major policy tool. There is only so much one can say with a 140-character limit.\n\nIvan Martchev is an investment specialist at institutional money manager Navellier and Associates. The opinions expressed are his own.

If you're wealthy, then you stand to benefit from Donald Trump's tax planâ€¦ right? That's the theme that most analyses of the president-elect's tax plan have focused on: The rich will pay less. But there are some higher-income Americans who may wind up paying more taxes under Trump than they have in past years.\n\nIf your taxable income falls into one of these groups, then you are one of them (taxable income here refers to your gross income â€” not adjusted gross income, which includes deductions or exemptions):\n\nâ€” Individual tax filer: Between $112,500 and $190,150\n\nâ€” Married or joint filers: Between $225,000 and $231,450\n\nTaxpayers reporting income in those ranges would see their marginal tax rate rise from 28% under current policy to 33% under the plan Trump proposed during his campaign. (Your marginal tax rate is the amount of tax paid on your next dollar of income, as you move into a higher tax bracket. It is not your overall, or effective, tax rate, which is typically lower.)\n\nThat means a single filer earning $190,150 (and taking the standard deduction) could pay $3,000 more in taxes under Trump's proposed plan, according to personal finance writer Sam Dogen. A single filer making $130,000 could pay $875 more in taxes, and joint filers who report gross income of $231,450 could see their taxes go up by about $320.\n\nIf you're doubting if someone with income in those ranges is wealthy, consider that the median household income in the U.S. is $55,775 and, even in expensive San Francisco, it's $90,500.\n\nStuck in the middle?\n\nThe hallmark of Trump's plan, which the Tax Foundation has estimated could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade in lost tax revenue, is lowering the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 33%. This would squeeze many taxpayers into a lower bracket than their current one, and some would move into a higher marginal tax bracket.\n\nThis graphic from HowMuch visualizes that squeezing (it calculates tax-bracket changes assuming filers use the standard deduction, which would increase under Trump's plan). As it shows, the richest taxpayers at the top see gains, and the poorest taxpayers at the bottom get hurt. But there is one slice of wealthy taxpayers in the upper brackets that would also get hurt â€” or, at least, benefit the least from the changes.\n\nThe number of people in this bracket is likely very small â€” less than 2% of American households, according to 2013 Internal Revenue Service data. In total, about 20% of all American households would see their taxes rise under Trump's plan, according to the Tax Policy Center.\n\n'A little causality of simplification'\n\nAlan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, says that most people assume reducing the number of tax brackets is one way to simplify the U.S.'s extraordinarily complex tax code â€” which has been a rallying cry for politicians, particularly on the Republican side of the aisle. The tax code contains about 4 million words â€” longer than the Bible, as Sen. Ted Cruz famously noted.\n\nBut, Cole says, reducing brackets is a minor simplification of the code, and one that won't have much of an effect.\n\nAdvocates for simplifying the tax code suggest that, to make a real difference, legislators would need to also turn their attention to the earned income tax credit, capital gains and education tax benefits, just to name a few issues.\n\nOf course, simply belonging to this relatively well-off, but newly tax-disadvantaged bracket doesn't guarantee your taxes will increase. Trump's plan would also add a new deduction for childcare expenses, plus other benefits for child and dependent care, and eliminate the alternative minimum tax and estate and gift taxes, all of which could affect your rate.\n\nAnd Trump's proposed plan is just that â€” a proposal, not policy, with many variables yet to come into focus.\n\nBut anytime the number of tax brackets is reduced, there will be winners and losers at all levels of the income scale. And those who fall into this camp would see less benefit â€” possibly considerably less â€” than any other upper-income bracket.\n\nWhen reducing the number of brackets, you don't want to have too much of a tax cut, but you also want to try to approximate something like the original curve, Cole said. The result of that means sometimes if you're not super generous all the way across, you're going to end up with a tax increase for some. It's a little causality of simplification.\n\nWhen merging tax brackets, there is no way for everybody to win and for there to not be losers, said tax attorney Mark Allison, of Caplin & Drysdale.\n\nAllison said that, for now, taxpayers shouldn't worry about the potential upheaval coming.\n\nDo what you would do without regard to potential tax changes, he said. If you need to sell an asset today, sell it. If you want to ride things out, ride things out. Don't let potential tax issues control your financial plans.\n\nFor more information on positioning yourself for tax savings under Donald Trump's tax plan, see Bill Bischoff's tips for reducing your tax bill.
The dollar's weakening trend continued on Monday, as the greenback fell anew against the euro, pound and other major crosses, while a holiday in the U.S. was set to keep volumes thinner than normal.\n\nWhat are currencies doing?\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.03% , which measures the buck against a basket of six rivals, was down 0.6% to 90.452.\n\nMeanwhile, the WSJ Dollar Index BUXX, +0.05% , which gauges the greenback against 16 currencies, dropped 0.4% to 84.43.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.03% climbed to $1.2267 from $1.2200 late Friday in New York, building on a 1.4% rally from last week.\n\nThe British pound GBPUSD, -0.14% was trading at $1.3774 from $1.3727 late Friday. Sterling on Monday has climbed as high as $1.3820, its best level against the buck since the U.K.'s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit.\n\nAgainst the Japanese yen USDJPY, -0.01% , the U.S. currency bought Â¥110.61 compared with Â¥111.04 on Friday.\n\nThe yuan jumped to its highest level against the dollar in more than two years on Monday, with the dollar USDCNY, +0.10% falling to an intraday low of 6.4189 yuan, according to FactSet data. The dollar has since pared its loss to trade around 6.4359 yuan. The People's Bank of China on Monday morning boosted its daily fix by the most in three months, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nU.S. equity and bond markets will be closed in observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The week will see earnings season continue, and traders will get a batch of data that includes a home builders' index and housing starts.\n\nData Friday showed core inflation rose slightly more than expected in December, which lent further support to the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates up to three times this year. Still, that failed to give the dollar much lift.\n\nThe euro has been bolstered on two fronts against the dollar, firstly by last week's minutes from the European Central Bank's December meeting suggesting a potential hawkish shift in policy. Further support from the single currency has come from news that German lawmakers are getting closer to agreeing on a governing coalition.\n\nFor the pound, investors will be keeping an eye out for debates in U.K. parliament over Brexit, due to take place Tuesday and Wednesday. The U.K. currency continues to draw support from last week's news that Spanish and Dutch finance ministers may be backing a soft Brexit, which would keep the U.K. from being shut out of trading with its biggest partner.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in an interview on Sunday that he still has doubts about the U.K. keeping its membership in the single market, without EU membership.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\nThe ECB will meet in 10 days, and unless Mario Draghi finds a way to convince markets that the unwinding of stimulus will be very slow, I think the euro will be marching towards 1.25 by end of Q1, Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nThis week, inflation figures once again will be under the spotlight in the U.K. and eurozone. I think if we get any surprise on Tuesday, it will be to the downside, so the rally in both currencies may pause, Sayed added.
Legal experts say President Donald Trump may be violating a 149-year-old statute by keeping agencies running despite the budget impasse that has cut off funding for roughly a quarter of the federal government, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAt issue is the Antideficiency Act, which Bloomberg writes was enacted in the shadow of the Civil War after federal agencies flouted the Constitution's prohibition on drawing money from the Treasury without appropriations made by law. Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore law school, tells Bloomberg that some agencies are playing fast and loose with their ability to tap either past funds or incoming revenues to keep open. The piece notes no one has ever been charged with violating the Antideficiency Act.\n\nOpinion:Trump's national emergency threat shows he's up against the wall in border fight.\n\nTrump may seek disaster funds for wall: With the partial government shutdown on its third week, the White House has asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to look into projects approved in a bill providing disaster relief for Puerto Rico, Texas, California and Florida to see where funding could be diverted to build a wall along the border with Mexico, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAs the Journal writes, Trump has signaled he may seek a way out of the impasse over funding a wall by declaring a national emergency at the border with Mexico. Federal law allows the president to halt military construction projects and divert those funds for an emergency.\n\nDemocrats try to rein in Ocasio-Cortez: Politico reports some members of the House Democratic caucus are mounting an operation to bring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into the fold, after becoming exasperated with the anti-establishment democratic socialist.\n\nThe piece says incumbent Democrats are most annoyed by the New York congresswoman's threat to back primary opponents against members of their ranks she deems too moderate. Also, Democratic leaders are upset that she railed against their new set of House rules on Twitter the first week of the new Congress. I'm sure Ms. Cortez means well, but there's almost an outstanding rule: Don't attack your own people, said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri. We just don't need sniping in our Democratic Caucus. Politico said the congresswoman declined to be interviewed for the story.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is poised to win a seat on the House Financial Services Committee, Politico reported separately.\n\nAlso see:Ocasio-Cortez slams Daily Caller for misleading fake nude headline.\n\nMarijuana lobby adds to team: The marijuana industry is boasting its largest lobbying team in Washington ever, as it gears up to push through major legislation in 2019, according to the Hill. The Cannabis Trade Federation, a nonprofit to educate and advocate for cannabis in public policy, has hired 15 lobbyists to push the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States (STATES) Act, the group told the Hill. The bill would protect state laws regulating marijuana use from the federal government.\n\nNow read:Marijuana IPOs in 2019: These companies could be the next hot pot stocks.
Finallyâ€”after years of horror stories about the economic impact of the growing number of retirees in the U.S.â€”some good news.\n\nAfter at least two decades in which more people were entering retirement than into the workforce, the tide is turning. For the next two decades, it will be just the reverse.\n\nIn other words, demographics in the U.S. are about to shift from being stiff headwinds to powerful tailwinds for the stock market.\n\nFor all this we can thank the millennial generation, which consists of those who were born in the 1980s and 1990s. Though that generation isn't as big as the infamous baby boom generation that preceded them, it is still big enough to represent a powerful economic force.\n\nTo be sure, I'm focusing on the economy as a whole, which doesn't mean that every individual's retirement prospects are brightening. In fact, as has been often noted in recent years, many have not saved and invested enough. A stronger long-term uptrend in the stock market is unable to bail out a retiree in that position.\n\nBut the upcoming shift in demographic trend is good news for those who have heavily invested their retirement portfolios in the stock market.\n\nHow good? For an answer I turn to a demographic indicator that researchers have found to be impressively correlated with the stock market: The ratio of the middle-aged population to those who are in the younger-aged cohortâ€”known as the MY ratio. According to a number of academic studies, the stock market tends to perform better when the MY ratio is rising than when it is declining.\n\nNotice from the accompanying chart that the MY ratio bottomed in 2016 and will be trending upward for two decades.\n\nThe chart also shows the MY ratio back to 1900 against the inflation-adjusted S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% . Alejandra Grindal, Senior International Economist for Ned Davis Research, writes that the MY ratio has had a pretty good track record in the U.S., helping define the beginning and end of some secular bull and bear equity markets. The stock market's 1981 low and the 2000 high are some of the MY ratio's most spectacular successes.\n\nTo quantify the MY ratio's track record, Grindal measured the correlation between the MY ratio and the inflation-adjusted Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% . She found a correlation coefficient of 0.71, which is impressively high. This coefficient would be 1.0 if the chart's two data series were completely correlated, and 0 if there was no correlation whatsoever.\n\nRead: This is how your finances should look in your 30s\n\nThe MY ratio isn't a perfect stock market forecaster, and the period since 2000 is a case in point. After all, since the ratio has steadily declined since then, the stock market should be a lot lower today than then.\n\nBut Grindal, in an interview, argued that we shouldn't be too quick to declare the MY ratio a failure. Without the Fed's extraordinary policy of quantitative easing over the last decade, for example, it's not unlikely that the stock market would be a lot lower today. In any case, the years since 2000 have included two of the worst bear markets in U.S. history.\n\nFurthermore, it's worth adding, even with the Fed's boost the stock market this century has been a well-below-average performer. Consider the inflation-adjusted return of various stock market averages from their early-2000 highs to the end of 2016, which is when the MY ratio hit bottom: The S&P 500 produced just a 0.1% annualized real return over that period, while the Nasdaq COMP, -3.02% produced an annualized 0.7% loss. The two-century average inflation-adjusted return for equities, according to the Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel, is between 6% and 7% annualized.\n\nHere's all you need to do in your 30s for a great financial future\n\nNote carefully that even if the MY ratio's forecast turns out to be right, it applies to the longer-term: The stock market should be materially higher in 10 to 15 years' time. The ratio doesn't have any ability to predict the stock market's shorter-term gyrations. So it would not be inconsistent with its forecast of a much higher stock market in the 2030s for equities to suffer a number of cyclical bear markets along the way.\n\nStill, as Grindal points out, demographics are one of the few indicators one can accurately forecast in the long-term. And, for the first time in many years, the bulls can stop being in denial about demographic indicators and start trumpeting their message.\n\nFor more information, including descriptions of the Hulbert Sentiment Indices, go toThe Hulbert Financial Digestor emailmark@hulbertratings.com.
The dollar gained ground versus most leading rivals, with the exception of the Japanese yen, on Wednesday, after a round of weak Chinese economic data underlined global growth worries and was blamed for sparking a global equity selloff.\n\nMarkets remain fragile and safe havens remain bid. The USD (U.S. dollar) will have a hard time selling off too dramatically as its attraction as both a safe haven and a high yielder will matter and spark further demand for USD assets, said Brad Bechtel, analyst at Jefferies, in a note.\n\nIn recent trading, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% was up 0.6% at 96.773. The dollar index logged its best annual rise in three years, up 4.3% in 2018, a year marked by worries about global tariffs, softening international economic growth and a Federal Reserve apparently adamant about normalizing interest-rate policy, if now at a slower pace than imagined just a few months ago.\n\nAgainst the yen USDJPY, +0.11% , the dollar bought Â¥108.88, down from Â¥109.72 late Tuesday. Over the last four trading sessions, the yen has gained around 2%.\n\nSigns of sputtering global expansion and broad stock-market jitters on the first trading day for equities in 2019 pushed investors into the relative shelter of the dollar, and initially, the haven yen. Asian stocks sold off sharply, driven by worries over the health of the world's second-largest economy, China, which has fueled an aversion to riskier assets.\n\nEuropean stocks traded lower but trimmed losses to finish slightly lower. U.S. stocks opened with hefty losses, but subsequently ended in positive territory, continuing recent volatile trade.\n\nBeijing's official read of manufacturing for December showed a more severe drop than one issued earlier, reflecting a fall to the weakest level since February 2016. The Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index registered 49.7 in December. A reading below 50 signals weakening conditions.\n\nThe dollar gauge, which measures the buck against a basket of a half-dozen currencies but is heavily weighted toward the euro, put in the best yearly performance in 2018 since a 9.3% return in 2015, according to FactSet data.\n\n\n\nThat trend was challenged lately, however, with the dollar index down 0.6% last week, amid growing uncertainty about how aggressive the Fed will be in increasing rates this year and in years to come. The Fed lifted interest rates for a ninth time two weeks ago but Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that the central bank may been more hesitant to do so amid signs of cross currents in the market and flagging growth abroad.\n\nThere is increased speculation that the Fed may have potentially overestimated the number of rate hikes it plans to deliver in 2019 and therefore, a more cautious period may be approaching for the dollar, said Christina Parthenidou, analyst at brokerage XM.\n\nMarket participants are also watching a partial U.S. government shutdown that is nearing its second week, with President Donald Trump inviting top lawmakers to sit down Wednesday afternoon and discuss reopening the government by resolving a dispute over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nHopes that a long-running trade clash between the U.S. and China may be resolved also has taken a toll on the greenback. Trade-war tensions between the world's two largest economies had been a key source of strength for the U.S. unit, with traders viewing the buck as a haven in the event that tariff disputes worsen.
Gold futures settled lower on Friday as strength in the U.S. dollar and equities in the wake of the monthly domestic jobs report dulled investment demand for the precious metal.\n\nPrices, however, gained for the week, buoyed by uncertainty surrounding the pace of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.\n\nFebruary gold US:GCG7 fell $7.90, or 0.7%, to settle at $1,173.40 an ounce, after notching its highest settlement in five weeks on Thursday. Expectations about the pace of rate increasesâ€”a negative for gold that doesn't offer a yieldâ€”has cooled somewhat. For the week, the yellow metal tallied a 1.8% gain, according to FactSet data.\n\nMeanwhile, March silver US:SIH7 was off 11.8 cents, or 0.7%, at $16.519 an ounce, paring its weekly rise to roughly 3.3%. March copper US:HGH7 added less than a cent to $2.546 a poundâ€”up about 1.6% for the week.\n\nThe Labor Department reported that 156,000 jobs were added in December to cap off the sixth straight year in which the economy created more than 2 million new jobs. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 180,000 increase in new nonfarm jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6%.\n\nAn increase in wage growth, however, provided support for the argument that the employment market remains on a solid footing. Average hourly wages jumped 0.4% to $26 last month, while hourly pay increased 2.9% from December 2015 to December 2016, marking the fastest 12-month increase since a recovery that began in mid-2009.\n\nStrength in the dollar, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.41% , a measure of the currency against six rival currencies, tacking on 0.7% Friday, weighed on gold, which is priced in the currency. A stronger buck makes assets priced in the currency more expensive to buyers using other monetary units.\n\nAs gold futures settled, U.S. equities traded broadly higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.46% just a few points short of the key 20,000 level. That drew more investor attention away from gold.\n\nBut the precious metal gained for the week, with traders and investors seeing it as oversold and a good value at these levels, Mark O'Byrne, research director at GoldCore, told MarketWatch.\n\nUncertainty regarding the soon to be inaugurated president-elect Donald Trump, the forthcoming elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands and the risks these pose to the eurozone is likely leading to a safe-haven bid, he said.\n\nSee:Here's the right way to trade Trump in 2017\n\nO'Byrne also said that the ongoing political spectacle this week between Trump and sections of the intelligence community is a continuing geopolitical risk and shows how unstable the political situation in the U.S. remains.\n\nColin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said momentum for a rise in gold has been aided by uncertainty raised about the pace of rate increases after the release on Wednesday of minutes from most recent meeting of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nFOMC minutes reminded the street that the higher dollar may have done some of the Fed's work for it, reining in inflation and economic activity, while members also reminded traders it remains uncertain what Trump plans/is able to actually do, Cieszynski wrote in a Friday note.\n\nThe Fed had indicated in December that at least three rate increases were in the offing for 2017, according to a forecast of interest rates from members of the central bank, known as the dot-plot.\n\nAmong other metals traded on Comex, palladium was a standout.\n\nPalladium futures rose Friday, with the March contract US:PAH7 up $20.15, or 2.7%, at $758.35 an ounce.\n\nPrices for the metal saw a weekly gain of roughly 11%, which would be the largest gain of its kind since the week ended March 6, FactSet data show.\n\nAnalysts at precious-metals consultancy Metals Focus said in a recent report that automotive demand should post another record high, driven by healthy demand in China and the U.S. Palladium is used in automobile catalytic converters.\n\nPart of the metal's expected climb will also likely be at the expense of platinum's use in diesel catalysts in Europe, the analysts said.\n\nApril platinum US:PLJ7 settled at $970.60 an ounce, down $5.40, or 0.6%â€”still ending 7.2% higher on the week.
The U.S. economic recovery will be uneven in 2021, but Federal Reserve policy is supporting the economy and may not need to change at all, said Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Monday.\n\nPolicy patience will prove to be a virtue Mester said, in a speech to the Maekyung-Korea-American Economic Association Forum.\n\nIn the near term, the surge in coronavirus cases is likely to weigh on economic activity this winter, Mester said.\n\nBut a slowdown in the first part of the year would not require more fiscal easing so long as the medium-run outlook remains intact, Mester said.\n\nThe medium-run view assumes that most people get vaccinated by September and economic activity will pick up, she said.\n\nThis return to growth won't require the Fed to take its foot off the gas because the economy will still be far from our employment and inflation goals, Mester said.\n\nOf course, if the economy evolves in a materially different fashion or if risks emerge, including those to financial stability, the Fed would be prepared to respond appropriately, the Cleveland Fed president said.\n\nThere is still a high degree on uncertainty around the outlook, although some of the worst-case scenarios and downside risks have lessened over time, Mester said.\n\nMester is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate committee this year. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Richmond's Thomas Barkin and San Francisco's Mary Daly will be voting members this year.\n\nEarlier Monday, Evans said he wanted Fed policy to shoot for inflation around a 2.5% annual rate to get the Fed to hit its 2% inflation target.\n\nMester said she expects inflation to gradually rise over the next few years.
Say goodbyeâ€”at least on Facebookâ€”to those annoying ads promising would-be investors they can make bank from the outsize gains in cryptocurrency NOW, at a 15% discount!\n\nAs of Tuesday, Facebook Inc. FB, -1.90% is banning ads which hawk financial products that are frequently associated with misleading and deceptive promotional practices, Rob Leathern, product management director wrote in a blog post. That means: initial coin offerings, cryptocurrencies and binary options, among other financial instruments.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond when asked by MarketWatch what effect, if any, the new ad policy change would have on the company's top and bottom line.\n\nFacebook stock is up nearly 1% to $187.73 during the regular session Tuesday. Shares have gained 43% in the past 12 months, as the S%P 500 index SPX, -1.48% rose 25%.\n\nDon't miss:Facebook earnings: How will news feed changes impact revenue?\n\nFor Facebook users, the policy change may signal an end to ads promising Use your retirement funds to buy Bitcoin! BTCUSD, +0.68%  and Start binary options trading now and receive a 10-risk free trades bonus! that have been peppering the site.\n\nGetting overwhelmed by bitcoins, ICO, and cryptocurrencies advertisements in my Facebook feedsâ€¦and it's getting annoying, user Simon Tay wrote in a November public post.\n\nThe policy's new scope is far-reaching and gives Facebook executives and employees wide discretion about what is and is not allowed under the new rules.\n\nRead:The YouTube and Instagram secret that Google and Facebook don't want you to know\n\nThis policy is intentionally broad while we work to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices, and enforcement will begin to ramp up across our platforms including Facebook, Audience Network and Instagram, Leathern wrote. We will revisit this policy and how we enforce it as our signals improve.\n\nLeathern also encouraged Facebook users to report ads that violate the new policies.
Waiters and waitresses could take home significantly less money if a new rule proposed by the Trump administration in December passes, critics say.\n\nChanges proposed by the Department of Labor on Dec. 5 would allow employers to legally pocket tips that servers earn at restaurants. The change, which would repeal part of a 2011 ruling that said employers could not pocket their workers' tips, is meant to level a growing disparity between what tipped employees like servers earn compared with back-of-house employees like cooks. After the changes, employers could take all tips earned by servers and redistribute them to workers that are not tipped.\n\nThat sounds like a fair plan, in theory.\n\nHowever, there is no guarantee employers would redistribute pooled tips, and critics say economic models show they will likely pocket them instead. If this proposed rule were finalized, restaurant owners could pocket between $523 million and $14.2 billion â€” with $5.8 billion being the best estimate â€” in tips earned by tipped workers each year, according to Economic Policy Institute economists Heidi Shierholz, David Cooper, Julia Wolfe, and Ben Zipperer.\n\nAnd nearly 80% of the tips that would be taken from employees would come out of the pockets of female tipped workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute. An economic analysis showing these negative effects of the change was scrubbed by the Department of Labor, a new report from the Economic Policy Institute reported, showing the lengths to which the Trump administration ... will go to hide the fact that they are taking steps to actively make workers' lives worse, it said. (The Department of Labor did not respond to request for comment.)\n\nThe big lie is that it will lead to restaurants sharing these tips with back of house, said Shierholz, senior economist and director policy at the Economic Policy Institute. Instead, she said employers will be able to control tips and take a big chunk of them as long as they pay the minimum wage. The proposal would require staff to make minimum wage, but allow tips to be pooled beyond that. (A spokesman for the Department of Labor said it intends to publish an informed cost benefit analysis as part of any final rule.)\n\nThe Moneyist: How to deal with a stingy friend\n\nThe Economic Policy Institute said the Department of Labor did not provide estimates of the number of tips that would be shifted from employers to employees under the new ruling. The Department of Labor previously said the rule is out to comment and that stakeholders are encouraged to provide data on the economic effects of the proposal.\n\nHowever, 12% of tipped workers had tips stolen by their employer or supervisor, according to a 2009 study from Center for Urban Economic Development, often leading to minimum wage violations. The ruling would also disproportionately affect non-white employees: White non-Hispanic tipped workers would lose $3.5 billion, Hispanic workers would lose $1.4 billion, black non-Hispanic tipped workers would lose $486 million, Asian workers would lose $391 million, and tipped workers who are of another race would lose $104 million, according to the Economic Policy Institute.\n\nSome restaurant workers say the Department of Labor changes are sorely needed as restaurants struggle to pay back-of-house workers like kitchen porters fairly in an industry with notoriously tight profit margins. In order for back-of-house workers to receive annual increases, tip credit needs to remain in place, said Joshua Chaisson, a server in Portland, Maine who has been involved in a grassroots campaign to undo similar legislation. Restaurants can then focus on increasing hourly wages, he said.\n\nBy his group's estimations, removing the tip credit would require restaurants to increase hourly wages of servers by 220% as long as they still received the standard tip rate of 20% from most customers â€” an unsustainable amount of pay for restaurants. This rise in wages for servers has led to more restaurants closing and fewer jobs for people in the service industry, Chaisson argues.\n\nBut the EPI's analysis suggested bigger profits would likely not be redistributed among workers, but rather go into the pockets of owners. To truly help back-of-house, low-income workers, wages need to be increased and employers should not be allowed to take tips, she added. There is far more incentive for them to pocket that money than to give it to employees, she said.\n\nThe proposed rule is up for public comment until Feb. 3. A spokesperson for the Department said stakeholders are encouraged to provide data on the economic effects of the proposal.
The Christmas rally that dragged bitcoin more than 25% off its 16-month low could be coming to an end, with a retest of recent lows on the cards, warns one analyst.\n\nBitcoin, the best-known of the 2,000 or so cryptocurrencies, has not logged consecutive winning weeks since early-September, but the bounce off the Dec. 16 low and subsequent consolidation has the bitcoin aficionados calling the bottom. But Jesse Colombo, analyst at RIA Advisors, said die-hard fans should cool their jets as a looming chart pattern could spell danger for owners of the world's largest digital currency.\n\nAccording to my analysis, however, bitcoin is forming another triangle pattern and is likely to make another big move once a breakout occurs, wrote Colombo. Bitcoin is still in a confirmed downtrend and a breakdown from this pattern would likely foreshadow the cryptocurrency hitting the low thousands or even under $1,000, eventually.\n\nRead:Crypto bubble has started to collapse, says ECB policy maker\n\nBitcoin triangle formation\n\nRead:From $100 to $1 million, here are the 11 most outrageous bitcoin predictions\n\nColombo calls this setup a continuation pattern where the same formation occurs â€” in this case, a descending triangle â€” and a break would see similar declines to the prior move. We could see another couple of thousand on the downside should we break, Colombo said in a follow-up call with MarketWatch.\n\nBut at these levels, even some of the biggest crypto skeptics argue the bounce has legs. Jeffrey Gundlach, the CEO of DoubleLine Capital, said on Tuesday a move to $5,000 is possible, adding it could be an easy 25%. But the Los Angeles-based money manager, who was speaking in his annual Just Markets webcast, added that trading digital assets is not for the faint of heart.\n\nGundlach famously predicted bitcoin's drop from its all-time high, advocating selling it on Dec. 13, 2017, when a single bitcoin BTCUSD, -1.22% was fetching more than $16,000.\n\nRead:Gundlach says this is how stock-market investors can survive the 'zigzags' of 2019\n\nHowever, Colombo â€” who predicted the break below $6,000 in October â€” said the overall trend is tough to go against and that the risk is that the remaining fruits of the 2017 rally could soon be wiped out.\n\nIf bitcoin breaks down from the current triangle, the downtrend will continue as the digital currency further erases its gains made during the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble, he wrote.\n\nRead:Winklevoss twins want you to imagine a day when your money works as easily as email
With England and Scotland moving to their third blanket lockdowns and most of Europe tightening their COVID-related restrictions, the attention of governments throughout the region is turning to the new fiscal effort needed to support the economy until vaccination campaigns succeed in controlling the pandemic.\n\nRead: Businesses thrown $6.2 billion lifeline to cope with latest U.K. lockdown\n\nThe outlook: The current situation doesn't quite compare with the spring 2020 lockdowns, inasmuch as the end of the COVID-19 pandemic may be in sight: Vaccination campaigns have started throughout Europe, albeit at different speeds, but they should begin to make a significant impact once a sufficient number of people have been inoculated.\n\nThe risk, as underlined by Boone, is that governments might panic at the size of their debt loads relative to GDP once the recovery is really in sight â€” in the second half of the year. And, as she explains, governments should try to avoid the mistakes they made right after the global financial crisis of 2008, by rushing into austerity much too soon.\n\nFrom the archives (December 2020): The global recovery remains uncertain â€” here's why the OECD wants fiscal stimulus to continue
Most Asia-Pacific stock markets chalked up modest gains Friday, following fresh records on major U.S. indexes, stemming two days of declines in the region.\n\nBut ongoing strength in the yen kept the main stock in Japan lower.\n\nThe Nikkei Average NIK, -1.17% fell 0.2% as the Japanese currency rallied for a third straight day after the Bank of Japan cut the size of ongoing purchases of government bonds for one bucket of longer-term debt.\n\nThat set off talk that it could be a small step toward policy normalization. Tighter monetary policy often sends a currency's value higher relative to others.\n\nSome investors have been reversing bets that the yen's value would fall as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates, and the BoJ has been seen as being some time off in doing the same. The dollar JPYUSD, 0.01 traded around Â¥111.25, versus Â¥111.80 when Tokyo stock trading ended Thursday.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index BUXX, +0.05% finished Thursday at its lowest level in nearly four months, but if later Friday's consumer-price report provides a hint of a stronger U.S. inflation...that might be the catalyst that the U.S. dollar needs for a turnaround, said Tim Kelleher, head of institutional sales at ASB Bank in New Zealand.\n\nBut Asian stocks rose in general Friday, after the region saw its first broad selling of the year the prior two days. Taiwan's Taiex XX:Y9999 rose 0.7%. Korea's Kospi 180721, -0.60% turned up 0.3%, aided as Samsung Electronics shares 005930, -0.60% pared their loss to 0.1%. Since Tuesday's fourth-quarter update, the stock has skidded more than 7%.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, -1.55% advanced 0.9%, marking a record-extending 14th straight gain as it marches closer to 2007's record highs.\n\nBright Smart Securities said southbound liquidity should continue to drive Hong Kong equities higher as long as nothing goes wrong in China-listed stocks.\n\nBroadly, while tracking the upbeat wave of sentiment from Wall Street, don't expect a sizable rebound overall in Asia ahead of the weekend, said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia at Oanda.\n\nRic Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Australia, didn't take Friday's gains as a total turnaround just yet. It needs to carry into next week for a rebound to be confirmed, he said. For now, the drop shouldn't be looked at anything but a minor pullback.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese stocks were little changed Friday during the session as trade data showed a much smaller-than-expected increase in imports last month. The Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, -1.45% ended up by 0.1%, a record 11th consecutive gain.
U.S. stocks fell at the open on Thursday as investors expressed their disappointment at the lack of policy details provided during President-elect Donald Trump's Wednesday press conference. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% shed 7 points, or 0.3%, to 2,268, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% lost 63 points, or 0.3%, to 19,893. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% fell 23 points, or 0.4%, to 5,540. In corporate news, Applied Optoelectronics Inc. AAOI, -4.56% shot higher after the company raised its earnings forecast. Meanwhile, investors focused on Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, -2.50% after the company posted quarterly earnings that matched forecasts and revenue that beat expectations.
Working while in high school or college may actually help you earn more when you leave.\n\nFor students born in the early 1980s, each extra year of school pushed their wages up about 7% on average, according to a working paper distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research this week. However, what you do with all that extra time is critical. After researchers stripped out variables such as demographics, whether students had accumulated work experience while in school and other unobservable characteristics, the wage premium went down to just 1%, the study found.\n\n 'There have been tons of studies that have wanted to know how valuable schooling is for future wages, but almost every study has ignored the fact that people are actually accruing work experience while they're getting their schooling.'  â€” Tyler Ransom, economics professor at the University of Oklahoma\n\nThere have been tons of studies that have wanted to know how valuable schooling is for future wages, but almost every study has ignored the fact that people are actually accruing work experience while they're getting their schooling, said Tyler Ransom, an economics professor at the University of Oklahoma and one of the authors of the study. Working while in high school or college is a lot more valuable than just attending school.\n\nThe study adds to the body of research and debate surrounding the merits of working while in school. There's evidence to indicate that college students who work about 15 to 20 hours a week do better in school, but that working more than 20 hours a week can put students in danger of taking longer to finish college or not completing at all. The latest study shows that on average, working while in school may also help students earn more money after they leave.\n\nStruggling to pay student debt? Here's what you need to know.\n\nEmployers seem to like people who work at least some during college, said Robert Kelchen, a professor at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey, who focuses on higher education finance. Then the policy question becomes, 'Do we want more students working during college and in what types of work?'\n\n 'Employers seem to like people who work at least some during college. Then the policy question becomes, 'Do we want more students working during college and in what types of work?''  â€” Robert Kelchen, a professor at Seton Hall University in South Orange\n\nStudents who work in their intended fields while in college tend to reap the most benefit out of their work, but even those who work at what we think of as more traditional college student jobs in, say, a cafeteria or at the library's front desk can benefit too, Kelchen said. It shows that you have some prior experience working for somebody else, working with others and basic things like punctuality. To a certain extent, a college degree can signal those skills as well, he said.\n\nThe study published this week didn't measure whether there was a threshold of work that was too high to be beneficial, Ransom said. For the average college student it would be a good idea to work in college, I can't say for what fraction of people that would be harmful.\n\nBut other research indicates that some students are working too much or have erratic hours, and that can interfere with their success in school, Kelchen noted. These days, given the high cost of college and the shifting demographics of college students â€” increasingly towards adults, parents and those from low-income backgrounds â€” very few college students are immune from the pressure to work while in school and, in some cases, they may be working so much to afford college that their education is put at risk.\n\nThe people who don't work at all during college are a very special group, Kelchen said. They tend to be younger, full-time students from higher income families and they don't need the money to help pay for college. That's the minority of students.
The U.S. housing-market recovery continues apace â€” nowhere more so than in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe total value of the U.S. housing stock grew to a record $29.6 trillion in 2016, an increase of nearly 6% and $1.6 trillion over the previous year, according to an analysis of the 35 largest metro areas by real-estate website Zillow. Portland, Ore., had the biggest increase in value among the largest housing markets, growing more than 13% in 2016, followed by Seattle (up 12.7%) and Dallas (up 11%). Los Angeles is the most valuable metro area, worth a cumulative $2.5 trillion. The U.S. housing market has regained all the value lost during the housing crisis, Zillow found. The cumulative value of all homes in the U.S. declined by $6.4 trillion between 2006 and 2012.
Treasury prices surged Monday for the third straight session, pushing yields to their lowest level in a week, as a global stock-market rout fueled demand for assets perceived as safe.\n\nAs stocks were hammered, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38% falling over 400 points at one point, demand for Treasurys rose and yields fell in all Treasury maturities.\n\nBond yields fall when prices rise and vice versa.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.742% lost as much as 6.8 basis points to 2.207%, its lowest point since Dec. 18, according to Tradeweb. The yield recovered slightly in the afternoon, closing down 3.8 basis points at 2.237%, its lowest level in a week.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.169% fell 3.6 basis points to 1.028%, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.474% closed down 2.9 basis points to 2.984%.\n\nWorries originated in China, where the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.51% slid almost 7% on the back of a weak manufacturing reading. The slide activated a new circuit-breaker system for Chinese stocks, halting trading on the mainland for the rest of the day and rekindling fears of a repeat of last August's plunge, when another selloff in China's stock market sparked an unraveling of stocks around the world.\n\nTreasury yields plunged rekindling fears of a repeat of the late-August selloff. Tradeweb\n\nEuropean stocks SXXP, +0.24% skidded and Germany's DAX 30 index DAX, -0.00% posted its worst performance since August.\n\nThe Treasury market was the clear beneficiary of the flight-to-quality flows, said Ian Lyngen, senior rates strategist at CRT Capital Group, in a note, particularly as traders had the urgency to establish positions before Friday's official U.S. jobs report.\n\nBut Monday's price actions is also not an absolute green light to buy Treasurys unless the repercussions of China's slowdown on the U.S. economy are corroborated by domestic data, said Anthony Valeri, investment strategist for LPL Financial. In that sense, Friday's jobs report will offer a clearer picture, Valeri added.\n\nMonday's moves mean that fundamentals began to matter again, said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. A focus on fundamentals is expected to intensify in 2016 because the crutch of central bank policy, particularly from the [Federal Reserve], is beginning to break, he said.\n\nThe weak economic data weren't limited to Chinese manufacturing. In the U.S., the Markit PMI manufacturing index fell Monday to its lowest level since October 2012, while the ISM manufacturing index fell to its lowest reading since the past month of the Great Recession.\n\nBut the final eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers index showed factories in the currency bloc ended 2015 with the strongest growth since April 2014.
As Democrats take control of the House, one of the party's big pushes is to resurrect the so-called Gephardt Rule, which in past decades has helped lawmakers limit fights over raising the debt ceiling.\n\nThis House rule, created by former Democratic Congressman Dick Gephardt, makes debt-ceiling increases automatic each time that Congress passes a budget that exceeds that limit. It was first applied in 1980, then suspended several times over the years â€” most recently in 2011.\n\nIf the Gephardt Rule were reinstated, it would make a debt-ceiling crisis less likely, said Stan Veuger, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank.\n\nThere are three sources of people who can refuse to raise the debt limit â€” the president, the Senate and the House â€” and now one of them has been removed, Veuger told MarketWatch. What's more, the debt ceiling has been a big issue for the House, but it hasn't been a huge deal in the Senate over the past few years, he added. Even so, it is possible that the Senate or president could refuse to lift the debt limit, Veuger said.\n\nThe Gephardt Rule has tended to result in automatic increases to the debt ceiling and less attention for that issue, but it doesn't always deliver.\n\nSince 1980, the rule has been effect for a total of 20 years, with suspensions or repeals over stretches such as 1994-97 and 2001-02, according to the Congressional Research Service's records. The House was able to initiate legislation that automatically lifted the debt ceiling in 20 cases during those years. In 15 of those cases, the resolutions became law after getting passed by the Senate â€” which hasn't had a comparable rule â€” but in five instances, the resolutions didn't get enacted, so there wasn't a resulting increase to the debt limit.\n\nCritics of Gephardt's brainchild, such as the conservative Heritage Foundation, have noted that it lets lawmakers steer clear of a stand-alone a vote on the debt limit that otherwise would provide an embarrassing reminder that Congress has failed to control spending.\n\nSupporters of the former House majority leader's rule have emphasized that not having it in place is like eating at a restaurant and then later haggling over the bill. One former Republican congressman told MarketWatch years ago described the debt-ceiling vote as kind of joke, adding that Gephardt viewed it as a waste of time.\n\nAEI's Veuger stressed that the debt-ceiling issue is significantly different from the current partial government shutdown, which has been sparked by a dispute over funding for a border wall.\n\nThe debt-ceiling debate is about spending that we've already agreed upon, he said. There's no substantive policy making there. It's really just about whether we choose to pay for spending we've already committed to. That's a big difference.\n\nVeuger views any debt-ceiling fight as potentially more damaging than a shutdown, because it really jeopardizes people's perception of the trustworthiness of the federal government when it comes to paying its debt.\n\nFights over the debt limit can weigh on markets SPX, -0.16% . Bringing back the Gephardt Rule will protect our nation's credit rating, said House Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, and Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat and incoming chairman of the House's rules committee, in a statement on a proposed rules package. The two lawmakers said their rules package will be introduced and voted on this week.\n\nOpinion from Caroline Baum:It's time to get rid of the debt ceiling\n\nThe debt-ceiling bickering has been slated to come back in less than two months. Last year's budget deal, signed into law in February by President Donald Trump, suspended the debt limit through March 1.
She's running?\n\nThere was speculation on social media on Wednesday that Nikki Haley, the outgoing U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, will attempt to become a Republican nominee for president, maybe as early as 2020, despite her pledge to help President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.\n\nThat's because she started a brand new account on Twitter, as she announced Tuesday, clear of all former tweets TWTR, -1.47% , and her former more than 1.5 million followers.\n\nDue to State Dept rules that were changed by the outgoing administration, I have had to clear my personal Twitter account that I have had for years, she tweeted. The followers, the history, the pictures, and all other content. Please refollow and retweet this to your friends. Here's to 2019!\n\nThe rules she appeared to be referring to, called 10 FAM 180, come from the Department of State and are part of an official foreign affairs manual and handbook.\n\nIt is not exactly clear which part of the rules Haley was citing as her reason for starting a new account.\n\nBut the rules do state that any social media sites have to be clearly labeled and identifiable as being an official account of the State Department. Haley's new account identifies her as a former U.S. ambassador to the UN, but does not use any identifiers in her Twitter name, nor handle, as her previous one did.\n\nGraham Lampa, who now works in communications for the Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., tweeted Tuesday that he was an author of the policy Haley referred to.\n\nIt was written in response to a perception within the Department that some senior officials and spokespeople â€” especially political appointee ambassadors â€” were directing official resources be used to build up the followings of their personal social media accounts, he said on Twitter.\n\nEven more to the point, Lampa said, is a 2015 note from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which says public officials should not benefit privately from their office, besides the salary they take.\n\nSo Haley may be trying to adhere to that ethics rule by showing she is willing to start her Twitter account fresh, without any of the followers she gained while working in the Department of State.\n\nShe wouldn't have done it if she didn't think it would matter, he said. It therefore stands to reason that â€¦ She's running.\n\nLampa did not immediately reply to MarketWatch's request for comment, nor did Twitter.\n\nThe Department of State, whose employees are furloughed due to the government shutdown, was unable to respond.
Millennials, the generation born between the early 1980s and the mid-to-late 1990s, make up about one-third of today's U.S. workforce. They are better educated than previous generations, with a greater proportion of them possessing a college degree. Because they have lived through the Great Recession, they are more risk averse. They are also more likely to begin to save earlier in their careers.\n\nMany millennials believe they will need to take action on their own to save for their retirement. Four out of five millennials surveyed are worried that Social Security will not be there for them when they are ready to retire. Not surprisingly, 55% cite self-funded savings as the expected primary source of retirement income according to a recent survey by the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.\n\nRead: Millennials are getting older â€” and that's good for stocks\n\nBut today's 53 million millennial workers face challenges when it comes to saving and investing for their retirement. This generation is disproportionally burdened by money-related stress, with 24% reporting that student loan debt is the source of this stress, according to a recent survey by Charles Schwab. And 72% of millennial workers surveyed by Transamerica agree that they do not know as much as they should about retirement investing and, among those participating in a retirement plan, a quarter admit to being unsure of how their savings are invested.\n\nRead: This is how your finances should look in your 20s\n\nHelping the youngest workers today understand the importance of securing their long-term financial well-being is an investment that will yield significant benefits. How soon and for how long an individual saves is important because of the power of compound interest. For example, compare a person saving $100 a month starting at age 27 with a person saving the same amount starting at age 37. The first will have contributed just one-third more by age 67, but would accumulate twice as much in savings, assuming a 6% annual rate of return.\n\nEverything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong\n\nJob mobility creates challenges\n\nToday's younger workers are more likely to work in nontraditional job settings and more likely to switch jobs than other age groups, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. The median job tenure among workers age 25 to 34 (2.8 years) is less than one-third of older workers age 55 to 64 (10.1 years). What's more, 55% of jobs held by those ages 18 to 28 lasted less than one year, and 70% of jobs lasted no more than two years. The challenges that come with frequent job changes include not staying long enough to become fully vested in the company 401(k) plan, the failure to roll over their retirement savings into new retirement plans, or forgetting about their account altogether when they change jobs.\n\nIt's not only job mobility that can hinder saving for retirement. Millennials either out of necessity or because they are attracted to the schedule flexibility often freelance or work more than one gig job. Today almost half of working millennials do freelance work and one-third of them are full-time freelancers, according to a 2017 study by Upwork and Freelancers Union.\n\nRead: Experts say this is the ideal retirement savings timeline\n\nBut this often means greater income instability and losing access to benefits such as employer-sponsored retirement plans. Workers are much more likely to save if their employer provides a retirement plan. More recently, new state-facilitated retirement savings programs as well as new low-cost, simplified mobile fintech (financial technology) platforms offer the potential for greater access to ways to save for gig employers and workers.\n\nEverything you need to do in your 20s for a great financial future\n\nThe value of behavioral nudges and financial wellness\n\nWorkers under 30 are more likely to identify as do it for me investors than workers over 30, expressing that they want advice from investment professionals, and indicating they would appreciate notifications such as alerts when they are not saving enough, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management. They also prefer features in their 401(k) plans such as automatic enrollment and automatic contribution escalation. Such nudges could prove effective, especially when Transamerica reports that 52% of millennials surveyed admit that they guessed the figure needed to save for retirement and only 10% used a retirement calculator or work sheet.\n\nMillennials have a lower level of financial literacy than older workers. Many of the most important financial decisions, including investing in higher education, saving for retirement, and purchasing a home, are made early in adult life. Addressing common budget challenges young workers might face such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and credit card debt, could help them save for retirement. For example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. While it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan. Providing opportunities to focus on the bigger picture of financial wellness can help workers better navigate these competing financial demands while encouraging planning and budgeting for unexpected expenses.\n\nThe greatest success and gains in strengthening retirement security will not come from helping workers who are already close to retirement age. It will come from helping the youngest workers understand the importance of starting to save as early as possible, and making saving easier.\n\nIn a recent survey of retirement plan participants by American Century Investments, 90% would tell their younger selves to save more. In 2016, the population of millennials surpassed the baby boomers. With the rise of the gig economy and the lack of access to traditional employer-sponsored retirement plans, new thinking about financial education and wellness, new retirement savings products and programs, and the value of behavioral nudges is needed to encourage young working adults to begin to save sooner so they can save more for their retirement.\n\nAngela M. Antonelli is a research professor and the executive director of theGeorgetown Center for Retirement Initiativesat the McCourt School of Public Policy.
A Federal Reserve official suggested the central bank's closely watched interest-rate forecasts should be accompanied by each member's unemployment and inflation target.\n\nThe proposal, put forward in a speech by Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester on Wednesday, would provide markets and economists with a way to link anticipated developments in the economy to the rate forecast.\n\nMester told an audience at Rutgers University that the move would help improve the Fed's communication.\n\nThe [summary of economic projections] could be enhanced by linking the variables for each participant's projection so that the public could see what each policymaker is projecting for growth, unemployment, and inflation, and what policy path he or she believes is appropriate given those projections. This could be done without revealing the identities of the participants and would convey information on each individual policymaker's reaction function, she said.\n\nMester also suggested the Fed alter the statement it releases after each decision.\n\nWe could improve the public's understanding of our monetary policy reaction function if the statement provided more of a narrative of our assessment of how changes in economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks around that outlook, and therefore, the appropriate policy path. In addition to the narrative, the statement would describe the current stance of policy and any policy actions taken, and some information on the future path of policy, she said.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest suggested Tuesday that a border tax on imported cars, backed earlier in the day by President-elect Donald Trump, would be the worst policy for the U.S. economy and consumers.\n\nIn a tweet, Trump took aim at General Motors Co, saying the auto-maker needs to be taxed on certain versions of the Chevrolet Cruze small car that it imports from Mexico to U.S. dealers.
Just two states in the country are spending as much on higher education per student as they did before the recession.\n\nNorth Dakota and Alaska increased higher education spending by 38% and 6% respectively between 2008 and 2014, according to a report released Thursday by Young Invincibles, a nonprofit millennial advocacy group, which has pushed a platform for debt-free college that includes increased state investment. Every other state cut higher education funding during the same period, the report found. On average, states cut per student spending by 21% during that period.\n\nYoung Invincibles graded each state on its levels of investment in higher education based on factors such as per student spending, average tuition and financial aid programs. Young Invincibles\n\nEven as the economy recovers, states' level of funding for their higher education institutions hasn't bounced back, the report found. The reasons for the cutbacks (or in two cases, the growth) in spending on colleges and universities vary based on state budget constraints, revenues and other factors. For example, it's likely North Dakota and Alaska were able to boost their higher education spending in part thanks to increased oil revenues, a resource not available in every state, said Tom Allison, the report's author.\n\nBut there may also be a broader explanation for continued disinvestment in higher education, which is that it's easy for policy makers to put funding for colleges and universities on the chopping block because constituents don't get as agitated by the cuts as they would about say, a tax increase, Allison said.\n\nYou don't have folks calling their legislators, calling their governors and paying close attention to the details of their state's higher education budgets, said Allison.\n\nStates with the largest cuts to higher education, according to Young Invincibles. Young Invincibles\n\nStates with the smallest cuts to higher education, according to Young Invincibles. Young Invincibles\n\nBut they should be, he says, because a cut in the state's higher education budget can have a direct impact on a family's budget. Between 2008 and 2014â€”the same time states were walking back their investment in public colleges and universities -- tuition and fees at two-year and four-year public universities rose 28% on average. The skyrocketing student debt we see is a symptom of a disease and the disease we see is state disinvestment from higher education, said Allison, Young Invincibles' deputy director of policy and research.\n\nGiven that state governments are required to balance their budgets every year, they may be hard pressed to step up their higher education funding without some kind of incentive, Allison said. Still, the report notes that Ohio, Maryland and Missouri did manage to put the brakes on tuition growth of tuition fees during the period studied by the report.\n\nOf course, the report isn't the first to draw a connection between state disinvestment in higher education and rising tuition or growing student debt. But Allison hopes that arming residents with information about how their state is treating its public colleges and universities and how that affects their pocketbooks may encourage students, their parents and others to ask their lawmakers to better fund their higher education institutions.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates have offered plans to address state disinvestment in higher education, including front-runner Hillary Clinton's proposal to award grants to states that make sure students don't have to borrow for tuition at four-year colleges and universities. Republican candidates have offered a mix of approaches to addressing student debt, including encouraging more private individuals and companies to invest in students in return for a portion of their salary postgraduation and boosting innovative higher education models such as online courses.\n\nIt's going to be necessary to have some national leadership on the issue, Allison said. The recession had serious consequences on this generation -- trying to pay for college at a time when states are basically pulling the rug out from underneath them or trying to get a job during the worst economy since the great recession.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the U.S. central bank can now be patient about further monetary policy and wait to see how conflicting signals from the market and the economy resolve themselves. In a conversation at the American Economics Association meeting in Atlanta, Powell said the central bank was open to changing course on rate hikes and reducing its balance sheet depending on how the economy evolves. In a brief opening remarks, Powell pushed back on the market's DJIA, -0.39% pessimism about the outlook, saying most of the hard data remain quite solid and suggest ongoing momentum going into 2019.
Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, one of the most consistent hawks on the central bank, announced Tuesday that he will leave his post in October.\n\nLacker has been president of the Richmond Fed since 2004. During his tenure, he had 15 dissents, the largest number of any current member of the Fed's policy committee.\n\nIt's been an honor to serve the Federal Reserve. I feel fortunate to have spent time throughout the [Richmond] District learning first-hand about people's economic experiences and to have participated in some of the most extraordinary policy deliberations in our nation's history, Lacker said in a statement.\n\nDuring the financial crisis, Lacker accepted the need for extraordinary actions from the central bank but was always cautious and concerned about mission creep, said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP.\n\nIn addition, Washington's response to the crisis had the perverse impact of making the country's largest bank's bigger, and Lacker was always very uneasy about that outcome, Crandall said.\n\nAnd he was eager for the Fed to return to a more normal policy stance once the economy began to recover, he added.\n\nMargaret Lewis, chair of the Richmond Fed's board of directors, said Lacker's views on monetary policy are well known. She said his passion and curiosity made him an effective ambassador for the central bank.\n\nThe regional Fed bank's board has formed a search committee, to be led by Lewis, to find a replacement. The board will conduct a nationwide search to identify a broad, diverse and highly qualified candidate pool from inside and outside the Fed system, the statement said.\n\nLiberal members of Congress have complained recently about the lack of diversity among the Fed's top ranks.
General Electric made what seemed like a smart move last month, giving investors several days to digest some bad news ahead of announcing its fourth-quarter results.\n\nGE still had to talk about the after-tax charge of $6.2 billion and additional cash funding of $15 billion in statutory capital contributions to its insurance subsidiary on its earnings call, but the surprise charge and reported loss was mitigated by talk of a better future. GE shares GE, -2.65% rallied after the company reported its results.\n\nBut there was more bad news to come, when GE was forced to acknowledge a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the process leading to the sudden multibillion-dollar charge, and an additional review of revenue recognition and controls over its long-term contracts.\n\nThe market immediately reversed the gains.\n\nSee:GE stock swings lower after disclosure of SEC investigation\n\nSee:GE posts $9.64 billion loss, sees more challenges\n\nWhen GE first announced the charge on Jan. 16, which related to the remnants of its long-term-care reinsurance portfolio, CEO John Flannery told analysts he had underappreciated the risk in this book.\n\nSo what happened?\n\nRead now:GE shocks market with multibillion-dollar loss in legacy reinsurance business\n\nGE's North America Life & Health subsidiary is a reinsurance portfolio the company held on to after mostly exiting the business between 2004 and 2006. A reinsurer buys the right to receive premiums from the primary insurers that deal directly with consumers in exchange for eventually shouldering any potential losses. Those primary insurers underwrite and administer the policies and process claims when they come in.\n\nThe majority of GE Capital's remaining insurance business, 60%, is related to long-term care insurance. At the time, Flannery told analysts, GE believed that a gradual runoff of existing claimsâ€”no new business has been added since 2006â€”would be more profitable than selling the whole business. Unfortunately, Flannery said this week, GE didn't anticipate the low interest rate environment, low policy lapse rates, and higher claims cost that it is seeing now.\n\nAs part of the IPO of the Genworth business and sale of ERC to reinsurer Swiss Re, GE derisked its balance sheet by approximately $130 billion of risky insurance assets and was paid approximately $13 billion in cash. However, what GE held on to was a book of business that was nowhere near ripe and is only recently showing its true colors.\n\nGE warned analysts as long ago as the second quarter of 2017 that a review of its claims experience and reserves was under way, and any charge would happen in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn its second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, GE wrote: We have recently experienced elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance products, which may result in a deficiency in reserves plus future premiums compared to future benefit payments. Should such a deficiency exist, we would record a charge to earnings in the second half of 2017 upon completion of this review.\n\nThem in its third-quarter filing with the SEC, GE warned about the potential charge again but with more details.\n\nWe have recently experienced elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term-care insurance contracts and are conducting a comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions across all insurance contracts, including a reassessment of future claim projections for long-term care contracts that will be incorporated within our annual test of future policy benefit reserves for premium deficiencies in the fourth quarter of 2017. We would record a charge to earnings for any premium deficiencies in the fourth quarter of 2017 upon completion of this review.\n\nAccounting experts were expecting the review to result in some financial charge, but not on this scale.\n\nThe review of business always carries the risk of unexpected findings, yet the magnitude of the $6.2 billion charge is far more staggering than the $3 billion that the market anticipated, research firm Audit Analytics wrote in a note to subscribers.\n\nAt its annual meeting last November, chief financial officer Jamie Miller told shareholders that GE was likely to take a charge of more than $3 billion.\n\nChanges in insurance claim reserves typically are disclosed in advance as changes in accounting estimates related to long-term care reserves. Companies are only required to disclose adjustments that are material. In its note Audit Analytics wrote it looked at data for 30 insurance companies and found 60 changes in accounting estimates for adjustments to any loss reserves filed with the SEC since 2004 , including related to long-term care portfolios. In many cases the disclosures did not specify the type of loss reserve being adjusted.\n\nAccording to Audit Analytics, the top five are:\n\nCompany Ticker Auditor Aggregate impact on pretax income (in millions) Number of changes in estimates China Life Insurance Co Ltd LFC, -1.13% EY (5,695) 6 Genworth Financial Inc. GNW, -1.42% KPMG (3,882) 9 Travelers Companies, Inc. TRV, -0.69% KPMG (1,210) 4 Humana Inc. HUM, +1.15% PwC (237) 2 Prudential Financial Inc PRU, -0.08% PwC (237) 1\n\nSource: Audit Analytics\n\nGenworth Financial GNW, -1.42% , the reinsurance business that GE spun off in 2004, disclosed in a routine SEC filing that year that periodic reviews of claim reserves are common and charges are to be expected. Since 2004, Genworth Financial has disclosed nine changes in estimates related to its long-term care portfolio, totaling $3.8 billion.\n\nA spokeswoman for Genworth Financial declined to comment on its relationship to GE or its reinsurance portfolio.\n\nThe last time GE disclosed any changes in reserves even partly attributable to the long-term-care reinsurance portfolio, according to Audit Analytics, was in its 2004 annual report, the same year it spun off the Genworth business. The company wrote that liabilities, reserves and annuity benefits were $4.5 billion higher than in 2003, and attributable to growth in annuities, long-term care insurance, structured settlements, the effects of the weaker U.S. dollar, increases in loss reserves for policies written in prior years and 2004 U.S. hurricane-related losses.\n\nOn a call when the charge was first announced, Chief Risk Officer Ryan Zanin told analysts that a large percentage of policyholders in their book of business were sold policies at a very early age and are only now reaching the prime claim paying periodâ€”ages 80 and up. Therefore, approximately 40% of inception-to-date claims have occurred in the last two years.\n\nRead:GE's pledge to be more accountable comes after SEC comments, stock plunge\n\nA GE spokeswoman told MarketWatch: GE has tested the adequacy of its policy reserves for the runoff insurance business every year through premium deficiency testing.\n\nIn all prior years, Zanin said on the January call, these tests resulted in a positive margin, which, under GAAP, requires that original assumptions above the book remain locked.\n\nIn the Elevator With James Dyson\n\nAlso on the call, JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa asked GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller whether the company was happy with its auditor. If these guys reviewed this stuff every year for the last several years and this is kind of a result of that, doesn't that kind of raise questions? he asked.\n\nFlannery said that he was not planning an auditor change.\n\nKPMG, the GE auditor for more than 100 years, is also the external auditor for Genworth Financial.\n\nA spokesman for KPMG emailed MarketWatch to say this: We are confident that our audits and reviews were appropriately performed in accordance with applicable professional standards, and we stand behind our work. Our client confidentiality obligations prohibit us from commenting further.
Here is the text of Sen. Bernie Sanders' speech on Wall Street and the economy, as prepared for delivery on Tuesday in New York:\n\nThe American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans â€“ half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.\n\nThey also know that a handful of people on Wall Street have extraordinary power over the economic and political life of our country. As most people know, in the 1990s and later, the financial interests spent billions of dollars in lobbying and campaign contributions to force through Congress the deregulation of Wall Street, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act and the weakening of consumer protection laws in states.\n\nThey spent this money in order to get the government off their backs and to show the American people what they could do with that new-won freedom. Well, they sure showed the American people. In 2008, the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior on Wall Street nearly destroyed the U.S. and global economy.\n\nMillions of Americans lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings.\n\nWhile Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider. And Wall Street executives still receive huge compensation packages as if the financial crisis they created never happened.\n\nGreed, fraud, dishonesty and arrogance, these are the words that best describe the reality of Wall Street today.\n\nSo, to those on Wall Street who may be listening today, let me be very clear. Greed is not good. In fact, the greed of Wall Street and corporate America is destroying the fabric of our nation. And, here is a New Year's Resolution that I will keep if elected president. If you do not end your greed, we will end it for you.\n\nWe will no longer tolerate an economy and a political system that has been rigged by Wall Street to benefit the wealthiest Americans in this country at the expense of everyone else.\n\nWhile President Obama deserves credit for improving this economy after the Wall Street crash, the reality is that a lot of unfinished business remains to be done.\n\nOur goal must be to create a financial system and an economy that works for all Americans, not just a handful of billionaires\n\nThat means we have got to end, once and for all, the scheme that is nothing more than a free insurance policy for Wall Street, the policy of too big to fail.\n\nWe need a banking system that is part of the productive economy â€“ making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.\n\nIn 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.\n\nIf a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.\n\nIf Teddy Roosevelt, the Republican trust-buster, were alive today, he would say break 'em up. And he would be right.\n\nAnd, here's how I will accomplish that.\n\nWithin the first 100 days of my administration, I will require the secretary of the Treasury Department to establish a Too-Big-to Fail list of commercial banks, shadow banks and insurance companies whose failure would pose a catastrophic risk to the United States economy without a taxpayer bailout.\n\nWithin one year, my administration will break these institutions up so that they no longer pose a grave threat to the economy as authorized under Section 121 of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nAnd, I will fight to reinstate a 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act to clearly separate commercial banking, investment banking and insurance services. Let's be clear: this legislation, introduced by my colleague Senator Elizabeth Warren, aims at the heart of the shadow banking system.\n\nIn my view, Senator Warren, is right. Dodd-Frank should have broken up Citigroup and other too- big-to-fail banks into pieces. And that's exactly what we need to do. And that's what I commit to do as president.\n\nNow, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.\n\nSecretary Clinton is wrong.\n\nShadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks â€“ something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.\n\nLet's not forget: President Franklin Roosevelt signed this bill into law precisely to prevent Wall Street speculators from causing another Great Depression. And, it worked for more than five decades until Wall Street watered it down under President Reagan and killed it under President Clinton.\n\nAnd, let's not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.\n\nSecretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.\n\nAs former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully â€¦ Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down â€“ busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.\n\nSecretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.\n\nMy opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out. The reality is that Congress doesn't regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.\n\nIt is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair â€“ and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions â€“ somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.\n\nWe live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.\n\nNot one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.\n\nThat will change under my administration. Equal Justice Under Law will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all Americans.\n\nIt seems like almost every few weeks we read about one giant financial institution after another being fined or reaching settlements for their reckless, unfair and deceptive activities.\n\nSome people believe that this is an aberration: that we have an honest financial system in which, every now and then, major financial institutions do something wrong and get caught. In my view, the evidence suggests that would be an incorrect analysis.\n\nThe reality is that fraud is the business model on Wall Street. It is not the exception to the rule. It is the rule. And in a weak regulatory climate the likelihood is that Wall Street gets away with a lot more illegal behavior than we know of.\n\nHow many times have we heard the myth that what Wall Street did may have been wrong but it wasn't illegal?\n\nLet me help shatter that myth today.\n\nSince 2009, major financial institutions in this country have been fined $204 billion. $204 billion. And that takes place in a weak regulatory climate.\n\nHere are just a few examples of when major banks were caught doing illegal activity.\n\nIn August 2014, Bank of America settled a case with the Department of Justice for more than $16 billion on charges that the bank misled investors about the riskiness of mortgage-backed securities it sold in the run-up to the crisis.\n\nIn November of 2013, JP Morgan settled a case for $13 billion with the Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency over charges the bank knowingly sold securities made up of low-quality mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nIn June of 2014, BNP Paribas was sentenced to five years' probation and was ordered to pay $8.9 billion in penalties by a U.S. District Judge in Manhattan after this bank pled guilty to charges of violating sanctions by conducting business in Sudan, Iran and Cuba.\n\nLet me read you a few headlines and you tell me how it makes sense that not one executive was prosecuted for fraud.\n\nCNN Headline, May 20, 2015: 5 big banks pay $5.4 billion for rigging currencies. Those banks include JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.\n\nHeadline from the International Business Times (February 24, 2015): Big Banks Under Investigation For Allegedly Fixing Precious Metals Prices. The Banks under investigation included Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nHeadline from The Real News Network (November 26, 2013): Documents in JPMorgan settlement reveal how every large bank in the U.S. has committed mortgage fraud.\n\nHeadline from The Washington Post (March 14, 2014): In lawsuit, FDIC accuses 16 big banks of fraud, conspiracy, which included Bank of America, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase.\n\nHeadline from the Guardian (April 2, 2011): How a big U.S. bank laundered billions from Mexico's murderous drug gangs. This article talks about how Wachovia (which was acquired by Wells Fargo) aided Mexican drug cartels in transferring billions of dollars in illegal drug money. Here is what the federal prosecutor (Jeffrey Sloman) said about this: Wachovia's blatant disregard for our banking laws gave international cocaine cartels a virtual carte blanche to finance their operations.\n\nYet, the total fine for this offense was less than 2% of the bank's $12.3 billion profit for 2009 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail.\n\nAnd, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.\n\nHeadline: The Wall Street Journal, February 9, 2011: J.P. Morgan Apologizes for Military Foreclosures. Here is a case where JP Morgan Chase, the largest bank in America, wrecked the finances of 4,000 military families in violation of the Civil Service Members Relief Act, yet no one went to jail.\n\nAnd, when I say that the business model of Wall Street is fraud that is not just Bernie Sanders talking. That is what financial executives told the University of Notre Dame in a study on the ethics of the financial services industry last year.\n\nAccording to this study, 51 percent of Wall Street executives making more than $500,000 a year found it likely that their competitors have engaged in unethical or illegal activity in order to gain an edge in the market.\n\nMore than one-third of financial executives have either witnessed or have firsthand knowledge of wrongdoing in the workplace.\n\nNearly one in five financial service professionals believe they must engage in illegal or unethical activity to be successful.\n\nTwenty-five percent of financial executives have signed or been asked to sign a confidentiality agreement that would prohibit reporting illegal or unethical activities to the authorities.\n\nHere's what one banker from Barclays said in 2010, when he was caught trying to price-fix the $5 trillion-per-day currency market: If you ain't cheating, you ain't trying.\n\nHere's what an analyst from Standard & Poors said in 2008, Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters.\n\nThis country can no longer afford to tolerate the culture of fraud and corruption on Wall Street.\n\nUnder my administration, Wall Street CEOs will no longer receive a get-out-of jail free card. Big banks will not be too big to fail. Big bankers will not be too big to jail.\n\nAs president, I will nominate and appoint people with a track record of standing up to power, rather than those who have made millions defending Wall Street CEOs. Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks will not be represented in my administration.\n\nAnd, if we are serious about reforming our financial system, we have got to establish a tax on Wall Street speculators. We have got to discourage reckless gambling on Wall Street and encourage productive investments in the job-creating economy.\n\nWe will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.\n\nWe cannot have a safe and sound financial system if we cannot trust the credit agencies to accurately rate financial products. And, the only way we can restore that trust is to make sure credit rating agencies cannot make a profit from Wall Street.\n\nInvestors would not have bought the risky mortgage backed derivatives that led to the Great Recession if credit agencies did not give these worthless financial products triple-A ratings â€“ ratings that they knew were bogus.\n\nAnd, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.\n\nUnder my administration, we will turn for-profit credit rating agencies into non-profit institutions, independent from Wall Street. No longer will Wall Street be able to pick and choose which credit agency will rate their products.\n\nIf we are going to create a financial system that works for all Americans, we have got to stop financial institutions from ripping off the American people by charging sky-high interest rates and outrageous fees.\n\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that Americans are paying a $4 or $5 fee each time they go to the ATM.\n\nIt is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.\n\nThe Bible has a term for this practice. It's called usury. And in The Divine Comedy, Dante reserved a special place in the Seventh Circle of Hell for those who charged people usurious interest rates.\n\nToday, we don't need the hellfire and the pitch forks, we don't need the rivers of boiling blood, but we do need a national usury law.\n\nToday, we need to cap interest rates on credit cards and consumer loans at 15 percent.\n\nIn 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well. Unlike big banks, credit unions did not receive a huge bailout from the taxpayers of this country. It is time to extend this cap to every lender in America.\n\nWe must also cap ATM fees at $2.00. People should not have to pay a 10 percent fee for withdrawing $40 of their own money out of an ATM.\n\nBig banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders.\n\nWe also need to give Americans affordable banking options.\n\nThe reality is that, unbelievably, millions of low-income Americans live in communities where there are no normal banking services. Today, if you live in a low-income community and you need to cash a check or get a loan to pay for a car repair or a medical emergency, where do you go?\n\nYou go to a payday lender who could charge an interest rate of over 300 percent and trap you into a vicious cycle of debt. That is unacceptable.\n\nWe need to stop payday lenders from ripping off millions of Americans. Post offices exist in almost every community in our country. One important way to provide decent banking opportunities for low income communities is to allow the U.S. postal Service to engage in basic banking services, and that's what I will fight for.\n\nFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.\n\nWhen Wall Street was on the verge of collapse, the Federal Reserve acted with a fierce sense of urgency to save the financial system. We need the Fed to act with the same boldness to combat unemployment and low wages.\n\nFurther, we need to structurally reform the Federal Reserve to make it a more democratic institution responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, not just the billionaires on Wall Street.\n\nIn my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.\n\nFurther, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.\n\nInstead of paying banks interest on these reserves, the Fed should charge them a fee that could be used to provide affordable loans to small businesses to create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nFinally, let me tell you what no other candidate will tell you. No president, not Bernie Sanders or anyone else, can effectively address the economic crises facing the working families of this country alone. The truth is that Wall Street, corporate America, the corporate media and wealthy campaign donors are just too powerful.\n\nWhat this campaign is about is building a political movement which revitalizes American democracy, which brings millions of people together â€“ black and white, Latino, Asian-American, Native American â€“ young and old, men and women, gay and straight, native born and immigrant, people of all religions.\n\nYes. Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes. Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them.\n\nYes. They have an endless supply of money. But we have something they don't have. And that is that when millions of working families stand together, demanding fundamental changes in our financial system, we have the power to bring about that change.\n\nYes, we can make our economy work for all Americans, not just a handful of wealthy speculators. And, now more than ever, that is exactly what we must do.\n\nAnd so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again.\n\nWill they like me? No. Will they begin to play by the rules if I'm president? You better believe it.\n\nThank you and I look forward to working with the most powerful force in our great nation, not the Barons of Wall Street but the people our government was created to serve.
The cost of college is a major challenge for students interested in pursuing a degree. For students behind bars, affordability can be an obstacle that's essentially impossible to overcome.\n\nNew research suggests that making it easier for people in federal and state prisons to pay for college would not only benefit the inmates themselves, but could provide also a broader economic boon.\n\nIf lawmakers were to lift the ban on prisoners accessing Pell grants â€” the money the federal government provides to low-income students to pay for college â€” the wages of all formerly incarcerated people would go up by $43.5 million during the first year of release, according to a report released Wednesday by the Vera Institute of Justice, an advocacy organization focused on the criminal justice system, and Georgetown University's Center on Poverty and Inequality.\n\nThe researchers estimate that if 50% of the eligible prisoner population took advantage of the program and took post-secondary classes while behind bars their likelihood of employment after release would on average jump by nearly 10%. The employment rate among all formerly incarcerated workers would also rise 2.1%.\n\n 'Having a post-secondary credential is one way to demonstrate that this person a has the skills and wants a life of economic opportunity.'  â€” â€”Margaret diZerega, a project director at Vera Institute of Justice\n\nWhat's more, making it easier for prisoners to pay for college while incarcerated would actually save states money â€” to the tune of $365.8 million per year â€” by cutting down on the likelihood that participants would return to prison.\n\nGiven that some college is becoming more necessary than ever to compete in today's economy, it only makes sense that making it easier for students to take classes behind bars would improve their chances of success once they leave, said Margaret diZerega, a project director at Vera and one of the authors of the study.\n\nPeople with conviction histories face a lot of barriers to employment and housing, diZerega said. Having a post-secondary credential is one way to demonstrate that this person a has the skills and wants a life of economic opportunity like anyone else.\n\nThe findings come amid increased urgency from both sides of the political aisle to address the consequences of mass incarceration on those who wind up in the criminal justice system and on society more broadly. The research suggests making college more affordable is one tool policymakers could use to mitigate some of these challenges.\n\nRight now, about 64% of inmates in state and federal prison are academically qualified to take college courses, according to the report, but most don't have access to these programs and even if they do, they likely can't afford the tuition, diZerega said.In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, just 9% of incarcerated people received a certificate from a higher education institution while in prison.\n\n A provision in the 1994 crime bill banned prisoners from accessing Pell grants. If lawmakers were to lift that ban, 463,000 prisoners could become eligible. \n\nOne reason it's so difficult for people behind bars to take college courses â€” a provision in the 1994 crime bill banned them from accessing Pell grants. If lawmakers were to lift that ban, 463,000 incarcerated individuals would become eligible for the funds, the study found.\n\nEven if every single one of those students took advantage of the opportunity to use a Pell grant, an extremely unlikely scenario, costs to the financial aid program would only rise about 10%, the report published Wednesday found.\n\nThere appears to be some momentum for reversing the ban. The Obama administration launched a pilot program in 2015 to provide access to Pell grants for some prisoners as a way to test the impact of a possible policy change.\n\nThough, at the time, some Republicans criticized the notion of spending federal financial-aid funds on incarcerated individuals, that experiment continues under the Trump administration.\n\nThere's a much greater understanding of the size and the scope of our mass incarceration problem in this country, then when lawmakers put ban on providing Pell grants to inmates in place, diZerega said.\n\nIncreasing access to higher education for people behind bars is part of a broader conversation that has bipartisan support to think about how to help people successfully come back to our communities, she added.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nI would like to know your advice about how adult children can protect themselves from the financial obligations of their parents.\n\nMy brother and I were raised in poverty and my mother still lives beneath the poverty line with government assistance covering some of her expenses. She has many medical issues and does not work. She is approaching 70 years of age.\n\nMy brother has a wife and two children and lives in another state. I am married with no children and live a few miles from my mother. We both have decent jobs and are what I would consider middle-class suburbanites.\n\nOur relationship with my mother has been strained for many years. There is not a lot of contact between my brother and our mother, or expectation of assistance emotionally or financially. It has been this way for many years. There are no hard feelings on this front. My relationship with my brother is strong.\n\nI have assisted my mom financially since I started working as a teenager. About 10 years ago, I got married and bought a house, had a very demanding job plus responsibility for my mother's medical, financial and emotional well-being. When I had medical issues of my own, it was all too much to handle and I landed in therapy.\n\nRead:I (secretly) charge an hourly rate for caring for my mom\n\nWhile I still care for and provide for my mother, I learned the co-dependent relationship I had with her was unhealthy and I have scaled back significantly.\n\nI pay for her to have high-speed internet service at her home. I activated the service to be able to work from her house during a stretch of major medical issues where she needed someone to be with her. She now has a home health aide (government provided) three days a week and I have not found myself in that situation in over a year, but I still consider the Wi-Fi insurance, so I keep it. I also include her on my family cellphone plan. I bring her household items and groceries on every visit.\n\n I no longer pay for any more of her debt. She uses her money on things I would consider careless and frivolous, but it is her money and I no longer intervene or express my frustration.  â€” Cindy in N.Y.\n\nI no longer pay for any more of her debt. She uses her money on things I would consider careless and frivolous, but it is her money and I no longer intervene or express my frustration. She finds herself in a bind on occasion, having things like her cable TV or her land line phone terminated.\n\nShe frequently gets calls and letters from collection agencies. These were things she would bring to my attention in the past and I would pay past-due balances, late fees and reconnection fees â€” regularly. I no longer offer to do that. Over the years she has gotten the message and she really doesn't push them on me anymore. It has relieved a lot of stress from my relationship with her. However, now they are just ignored and pile up without any action.\n\nToday, it is very important to me to focus on my well-being, which means not returning to our previous relationship which left me damaged financially and emotionally. At the same time I have a lot of stress and anxiety about where this will leave me if and when (a) she passes on, (b) a decision has to be made to change her living situation (in my home or a nursing home) or (c) something major happens, like a legal judgment against her.\n\nMy husband is financially smart. Without him, I would have likely traveled down the same financial road as my mother. With him, I have had the guidance and support to pay off years of mounting debt, buy a house and start saving for retirement. The thought of taking a hit to everything we have worked so hard to build causes a lot of stress. My husband has concerns about me not acquiring her debt and/or expenses when the time comes and he feels it will destroy us financially. I don't disagree with him. I just struggle with doing right by everyone.\n\nI don't know what I would be responsible for financially as her daughter when she is truly incapable. I'm not sure if it's smarter to move her in with us or start to look into assisted living/nursing homes, especially if covered by the government programs that have covered her all these years.\n\nWhat could I be doing prepare or protect myself financially?\n\nCindy in N.Y.\n\nDear Cindy,\n\nRarely has a letter moved me as much as yours. You have created a wonderful life for yourself and done so without becoming hard of heart to those in your life or bitter about the past. You have maintained a strong relationship with your brother and a relationship with your mother that is based on love and service, while maintaining healthy emotional and financial boundaries. You have since learned that you can't do everything, nor should you have to do everything.\n\nI'm glad that you finally realized that you cannot live her life for her. You deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future. That's nothing to feel guilty about. Plenty of children would have walked away. You didn't. This is something that your mother was either unable or unwilling to provide for you. In the face of remarkable odds, you provided it for yourself. And yet you are still thinking of others.\n\n You deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future.  â€” The Moneyist\n\nMoving your mom in with you seems to run counter to your desire to maintain healthy boundaries, says Anne Tumlinson, founder of Daughterhood, a Washington, DC-based organization that provides information and resources to people caring for aging parents. That's not necessary in New York. Additionally, your mother is already obviously on Medicaid so you don't need to worry about whether your mother will qualify, which is usually a huge thing given people's assets and incomes that usually need to be spent-down first.\n\nYou are not alone. An estimated 43.5 million adults in the U.S. have provided unpaid care to an adult or a child within the prior 12 months, according to the 2015 report Caregiving in the U.S. by the AARP Public Policy Institute, the advocacy group for Americans aged 50 years and older. More than 18% of the respondents interviewed reported being caregivers. The majority of caregivers are female (60%), the AARP said, and the average caregiver is 49 years of age.\n\nThe Moneyist: How to deal with a stingy friend\n\nIt's highly unlikely that you would be held responsible for your mother's debts when she passes on. Don't co-sign any loans and maintain a clear line between her finances and your own and keep an eye on your credit score, in the unlikely event that your mother would take out a loan in your name (especially if you shared the same first name). Unless you are a co-signer on a debt, you are in no way liable for your mother's debts, says Blake Harris, an attorney at Mile High Estate Planning in Denver. There isn't anything you need to do aside from continuing to follow your husband's wise financial advice.\n\nSome 28 U.S. states have so-called filial responsibility laws, which can be traced back to colonial times and (in theory) impose a duty on adult children to support their impoverished parents. Those states don't include New York. Here's a list of the other 28 that do have those laws, even if they don't practice them. One of those states is Pennsylvania, which did use filial responsibility to force an adult child to pay his mother's bill. In 2012, Pennsylvania court ruled that John Pittas must pay his mother's $93,000 nursing home bill after she moved to Greece. Otherwise, they are rarely enforced.\n\nThe AARP and other organizations have helpful guides for preparing to care for an elderly parent. This includes figuring out what your mother's needs might be and forming a team (that includes your brother and husband). There are many online resources to see if she qualifies for public benefits of state, federal, and private programs that help pay for groceries, prescription drugs, health insurance and home help. The best time to think about these issues is now, before there's a crisis. And, as my former colleague Elizabeth O'Brien wrote, take care of yourself too.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

A multi-state outbreak of infections caused by E. coli bacteria has occurred â€” and while Canadian health officials believe romaine lettuce is the source, American officials aren't sure yet.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed in late December that it's investigating (along with the Food and Drug Administration and state governments) an E. coli outbreak that infected at least 17 people â€” sending five people to the hospital and killing at least one, according to the CDC. The outbreak hit 13 states between mid-November and early December; no new cases have been reported since then.\n\nSince then, the CDC has said that the likely source of the outbreak appears to be leafy greens, but warned that officials have not settled on a specific type that is to blame. The CDC has said it is still investigating, and noted that genome sequencing on samples of the bacteria indicated the U.S. and Canadian outbreaks might be linked.\n\nAcross the border, Canadian public health officials are investigating their own E. coli outbreak, which sickened at least 41 people and caused one death. American public health officials suggested the two outbreaks could be caused by the same strain of bacteria. Preliminary results show that the type of E. coli making people sick in both countries is closely related genetically, meaning the ill people are more likely to share a common source of infection, a spokesperson for the CDC said in an email.\n\nIn Canada, authorities issued a public health notice saying that initial findings indicate that contaminated romaine lettuce was the source of the outbreak. The nation's Public Health Agency went so far as to recommend residents of five provinces consider consuming other types of lettuce, instead of romaine lettuce, until more is known about the outbreak and the cause of contamination.\n\nBut here in the U.S., officials at the CDC or the FDA have taken a different approach and decided not to issue such a warning. Because CDC has not identified a specific type of leafy greens linked to the U.S. infections, and because of the short shelf life of leafy greens, CDC is not recommending that U.S. residents avoid any particular food at this time, the agency said.\n\nThis inaction from the CDC and the FDA has prompted sharp criticism in recent weeks from consumer advocates. The FDA should follow the lead of the Canadian government and immediately warn the public about this risk, Jean Halloran, director of Food Policy Initiatives at Consumers Union, told Consumer Reports. The available data strongly suggest that romaine lettuce is the source of the U.S. outbreak â€¦ If so, and people aren't warned, more may get sick.\n\nDon't miss:'Raw water' competes with bottled water and soda â€” why you should avoid all threeCan boxed water compete against bottled water? Water companies are turning to environmentally-friendly packaging - and sales have doubled in the last two years.\n\nWhy there is still cause for concern\n\nWhen bacterial contamination stems from something highly perishable like romaine lettuce, outbreaks are usually more short-lived, said Bill Marler, an attorney who represents victims in cases involving food safety. The illnesses extend over a month, and that's unusual, he said. Normally when you see an outbreak with a perishable product, you'll see an outbreak over a week.\n\nPlus, Marler said that the relatively small number of people made ill could actually indicate a larger outbreak, since many people may not be made ill enough by the bacteria to result in visiting a doctor.\n\nThis all points to two possibilities: Romaine lettuce may not be the source of the outbreak. Or, perhaps more concerning, it could be an indication of manufacturing-related issues, Marler said. Either that, or the food that caused the outbreak was produced on a farm that had a contamination, Marler said.\n\nThe long duration of the outbreak in Canada has also prompted officials there to investigate other potential sources.\n\nWhy people should avoid romaine lettuce (and other foods) anyway\n\nNevertheless, the hesitancy on the part of U.S. public health officials stumped Marler. There's always a balance with these health officials between outing a company or product and giving the public information to protect themselves, but it's perplexing to me that this has been going on for a long period of time without naming a product, he said.\n\nConsequently, Marler suggested that people toss the romaine lettuce sitting in their fridges for the time being. Consumer Reports similarly advised that people avoid romaine lettuce until public health officials provide more information. Both Marler and Consumer Reports argued that the abundance of caution was warranted because romaine lettuce is nearly always consumed raw and washing alone isn't guaranteed to rid the produce of the bacteria.\n\nAlso see:Americans are eating more red meat â€” why that's good news\n\nA group of produce industry associations pushed back against such calls given the lack of CDC confirmation regarding the cause of the outbreak and how perishable lettuce is. No public agency has contacted any Romaine lettuce grower, shipper or processor and requested that they either stop shipping or recall product already in the marketplace, they said.\n\nBut health-conscious consumers may want to be careful, and not only around romaine lettuce â€” other foods are susceptible to contamination from E. coli and other bacteria. For instance, Marler said he never eats pre-washed bagged salad mixes or pre-cut fruits because the more that raw produce is handled the greater the likelihood of bacterial contamination. Instead he purchases ingredients separately, washes and prepares them.\n\nGenerally speaking, leafy greens and herbs are at a higher risk of contamination, particularly in the summer months, according to a 2016 study by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. However, even among these foods, incidents of food-borne illness are considered rare.\n\nMarler further suggested consumers avoid everything from sprouts (a notable E. coli outbreak stemming from sprouts sickened roughly 3,000 people in Germany in 2011), raw juices and milk. And consumers should certainly steer clear of under-cooked meat, unpasteurized raw eggs and raw shellfish. And pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems may want to put the fork down where cantaloupe is concerned, since it is a common source of listeria â€” a 2011 listeria outbreak tied to the melon was responsible for more than 30 deaths.
Among the crush of solicitations from nonprofits we've come to expect in our inboxes during the holiday season, one stood out in particular to Rachel Fishman this year.\n\nKeep Our Rankings High read the subject line of the email from her alma mater, the University of Wisconsin.\n\nAs a higher education policy expert â€” Fishman is the deputy director for research and the education policy program at New America, a think tank â€” she's given a lot of thought to rankings, the oft-maligned arbiter of college quality found annually in U.S. News & World Report and other publications.\n\nWhen I get such a brazen email that is basically saying this is a way we are gaming the rankings...it just didn't sit well with me, Fishman said.\n\nRankings have been under scrutiny in recent years\n\nThe email highlights a relationship well understood in the higher education universe, but little discussed in the mainstream. Broadly, a college's success at reeling in philanthropy can impact its prestige. More specifically, U.S. News & World Report's Best Colleges, the most prominent college ranking, weighs alumni donor participation in evaluating a school.\n\nThe share of alumni who donate represents 5% of U.S. News' formula, a fraction of the weight the company gives to outcome measures, like graduation and retention rates and social mobility, which account for 35% of the formula, Robert Morse, the chief data strategist at U.S. News, wrote in an email. The donation rate is meant to serve as an indirect measure of graduates' satisfaction and engagement with their schools, he wrote.\n\n The share of alumni who donate represents 5% of U.S. News' formula, a fraction of the weight the company gives to outcome measures, like graduation and retention rates and social mobility, which account for 35% of the formula. \n\nBut the relationship between donations and rankings also emphasizes the ways in which well-resourced colleges are in a better position to compete and continue to pull in more resources.\n\nWhat does that metric tell you about the quality of your degree? Or the return on investment? Fishman said of the share of alumni giving. Instead, it's likely simply a signal that the school probably had many strong (and perhaps wealthier) students coming in, with a relatively good chance of success â€” and money to donate â€” when they leave, she added.\n\nThe schools that educate the wealthiest students get the most donations\n\nThe U.S. News rankings have come under increased scrutiny over the past few years, including from U.S. Senators, over claims they incentivize colleges to be more selective â€” which often means competing for and catering to students who would likely be successful no matter which college they attend â€” at the expense of students for whom a college degree could be truly transformative.\n\nAt the same time, the schools that admit a wide swath of applicants and in many cases alter their trajectory with limited resources at their disposal are rarely rewarded for their efforts, critics say.\n\nA similar dynamic exists in college philanthropy. It's the best-resourced schools educating the most prepared â€” and in many cases, wealthiest â€” students who nab the bulk of donations to colleges. At the same time, community colleges and other regional schools doing the yeoman's work of educating America's students often struggle to raise funds.\n\nSee also:Why Bloomberg's $1.8 billion Johns Hopkins donation won't transform college affordability\n\nAt U.S. News-ranked schools, only about 11% of alumni donate\n\nThe relationship between donations and rankings may reinforce the troubling trends in both areas.\n\nAt most colleges, a relatively low percentage of alumni donate (the average for all U.S. News-ranked schools is roughly 11%), and it's not a great measure of how satisfied students were with their alma mater, said Robert Kelchen, a professor at Seton Hall University who focuses on higher education finance.\n\nFor example, the rate is the percentage of alumni a school has records for that donate to the school, which means it's unlikely students who were unsatisfied with the school are included in the calculation, he said.\n\nAlumni giving rates probably become less and less valuable as colleges try to do everything they can to increase the rates, Kelchen said. It seems like most of these alumni donation pushes are from schools that are already fairly wealthy and well-resourced and have the alumni offices to reach out.\n\n Alumni giving rates probably become less and less valuable as colleges try to do everything they can to increase the rates.  â€” Robert Kelchen, Seton Hall University\n\nFor most schools, moving up in the rankings isn't a major priority of their development strategy, said Linda Durant, the vice president of development at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, a membership organization that serves professionals in the advancement and development sectors of education institutions.\n\nIndeed, at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the rankings-themed email was one of nine different messages the school sent to alumni during its fall campaign, Tod Pritchard, a spokesman at the Wisconsin Foundation & Alumni Association, wrote in an email. Other messages sent to alumni featured themes like the importance of philanthropy to maintaining Wisconsin's traditions and level of excellence and the impact the funds have on the student experience. The rankings message performed about average, Pritchard wrote.\n\nRankings can be a strong motivator for younger alumni\n\nRankings and other types of competition can be a particularly strong motivator for young alumni to donate, Durant said. Because this group may be struggling with student debt and other financial challenges that come with being early in your career, the idea that they can contribute to the school's success without donating a huge amount of money can be appealing, she said.\n\nBuilding a relationship with this group is especially important for colleges. If the schools are able to get them in the habit of giving, even small amounts, consistently, that could lead to larger donations in the future, experts say.\n\nBut it's possible for a rankings-themed pitch to backfire, even with alumni who aren't as savvy as Fishman, said Jonathan Meer, an economist at Texas A&M University who studies charitable giving.\n\n 'I was all geared up to help kids with financial aid and help advance science and here you are talking about what's in it for you. For some people that's going to be a turn off.'  â€” â€” Jonathan Meer, an economist at Texas A&M University who studies charitable giving\n\nIt detracts from the intrinsic motivation, that a donor may have for giving, he said. It's easy to imagine some recipients thinking I was all geared up to help kids with financial aid and help advance science and here you are talking about what's in it for you, he said. For some people that's going to be a turn off.\n\nFor some though, competition can be a compelling motivator. Thomas Harnisch, the director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, sent a tongue and cheek tweet after receiving the Wisconsin email indicating that defeating rivals Ohio State University and the University of Michigan in the rankings could push him to donate.\n\nIt's a way to draw people in, he said. Like anything in sales and fundraising you need to clearly describe a problem and create a sense of urgency and rankings and rivalries can do that for some alumni.\n\nAs a higher education policy expert, Harnisch said he also sees why some view the rankings as superficial or even counterproductive. But he's particularly concerned about the finances of public colleges in states like Wisconsin, where state lawmakers have pulled back on funding their higher education institutions. Anything schools can do to convince people to make up that shortfall is useful, he said.\n\nPhilanthropy is incredibly important, he said. Universities are going to be looking for angles to try to get people to donate and rankings and how the university stacks up with their rivals is one approach to doing that.
S&P Global Ratings raised Greece's credit rating by one rung to B from B- on Friday, marking the first time S&P has upgraded the country's sovereign debt in two years. The outlook was kept positive, which implies another upgrade is likely. The sovereign bond rating is still 5 notches below investment grade. Greece's growth and fiscal outlooks have improved alongside a labor market recovery and amid a period of relative policy certainty, S&P said. Investor reaction to the announcement is likely to show up later next week as European markets were closed before the report.
A new sweep of three big banks and six traders for allegedly manipulating metals futures relied heavily on electronic chatter to build a case.\n\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced criminal and civil enforcement actions on Monday against Deutsche Bank AG and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, UBS AG and HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and six individuals involved in spoofing and stop loss collusion schemes. The criminal and civil enforcement actions were filed in conjunction with the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation's Criminal Investigative Division.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. were hit the hardest, agreeing to pay a $30 million penalty while neither admitting or denying they failed to supervise precious metals traders who allegedly schemed to manipulate the price of precious metals futures contracts and allegedly colluding to trigger customer stop-loss orders. The fraud allegedly ran from Feb. 2008 to at least Sept. 2014.\n\nSpoofing is when traders place large bids or offers in the futures market with the intent to cancel before execution after another smaller bid or offer is placed on the opposite side of the same market. The purpose of the scheme is to create the false appearance of market depth, which in turn creates the impression of greater buying or selling interest than legitimately exists.\n\nAs in past enforcement orders regarding traders schemes, the CFTC along with the U.S. Attorney's office and the FBI relied on the mandatory recordings of trader chatter to prove the brazen nature of the schemes.\n\nRead:Futures regulator fines Citigroup $25 million for spoofing in U.S. Treasury market\n\nOne trader was recorded responding to another trader's discussion of a bid with, For anyone. Or a spoof? to which the other trader admits, spoof.\n\nIn another conversation, one trader admitted in another in a chat that he used spoofing to manipulate the market: so glad I could help...got that up 2 bucks...that does show u how easy it is to manipulate it so[me]times. Trader A commented further: that was alot of clicking...i know how to 'game' this stuff.\n\nTrader A then added: i f..k the m[ar]k[e]t around a lot...not alot of people...had it figgied out...thats [sic] why i love electronic trading.\n\nIn another example, one of the same traders identified earlier asked another trader, can I give you 1k plat[inum] pls ... and 5 k gold. That trader wrote: yep, then asked: i am selling both ... right? to which Trader F responded: yep ... spoofing it up ... ahem ahem.\n\nIn another chat, a trader discussed precious metals trading with another trader, telling that trader: i skewed the quote to the left ... people scared ... we[']ll spoof it ahahaha.\n\nOne UBS trader, for example, while discussing trading activity a trader at another bank, wrote: hahaah, and the other trader responded: u [mu]st have [a]bout gazillions ... and u spoof the sell. The UBS trader wrote: we good ain[']t we, to which the other trader replied: not very friendly.\n\nThe UBS trader response? we never are ... u want a fr[ien]d ... get a dog ... ahahahah.\n\nIn another example, one UBS trader discussed trading activity with another UBS trader, writing, u gotta be quick with spoofs cause everyone else knows the trick too ... except for smaller shops ... and a/gos of course.\n\nThe CFTC said in its complaint that Deutsche Bank did maintain systems and policies designed to detect and deter spoofing but had failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. Deutsche Bank put in place an electronic surveillance system to monitor trading patterns in order to detect potential spoofing in precious metals futures contracts by its traders, and the system did detect several hundred instances of potential spoofing by its traders, including several of the ones cited in the complaint. However, the regulator said it did not follow up on the majority of potential instances of misconduct identified by its electronic surveillance system.\n\nUBS AG agreed to pay a $15 million, without admitting or denying the allegations, for an alleged scheme by some precious metals traders on its spot desk.\n\nThe CFTC also settled charges on Monday against HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. for the acts of spoofing by one of its traders based in HSBC's New York office, who was allegedly spoofing in certain futures contracts in gold and other precious metals traded on COMEX from at least July 16, 2011, through August 2014. HSBC agreed to pay a fine of $1.6 million.\n\nJustin Slaughter, the former chief policy adviser and special counsel to CFTC Commissioner Sharon Y. Bowen, told MarketWatch, The substance of the cases themselves is interesting. But what's really interesting is that the CFTC states it substantially reduced the fines for the three banks because they cooperated. HSBC, in particular, seems to have been fined the equivalent of a parking ticket for a major financial institution that let one of its employee to engage in a multi-year spoofing scheme.\n\nIt seems clear, said Slaughter, that the CFTC's nascent program of trading cooperation with enforcement inquiries for substantially reduced fines will apply to all financial industry actors, up to and including large banks.

The yuan could slide another 6% over the next 12 months as policy makers grapple with how to handle a weaker economy, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn a note published on Friday, the investment bank cut its forecast for the Chinese currency, saying it now expects the dollar USDCNY, +0.07% to buy 7.00 yuan in 12 months, up from their previous forecast of 6.60 yuan. By the end of 2017, Goldman expects the dollar to buy 7.30 yuan, up from 6.80 yuan.\n\nThe lowered yuan forecast is consistent with our view that 2016 will be a year of continued 'bumpy deceleration' and significant policy easing in the Chinese economy, and that the potential for greater CNY depreciation remains a large source of uncertainty, the analyst team, led by Goldman's chief Asia-Pacific economist Andrew Tilton, said in the note.\n\nThe weaker outlook comes after the yuan reached its lowest level against the dollar in five years on Thursday, following repeated devaluations by the People's Bank of China this week. Chinese policy makers have pushed the currency lower to try and help boost the competitiveness of the country's exporters. But the moved unleashed turmoil in both local and international stock markets by raising concerns that China's economy was weakening too quickly.\n\nAdditionally, a weaker yuan is feared to drive the global economy closer to a recession as the purchasing power of the world's second largest economy deteriorates every time the currency is devalued.\n\nHowever, on Friday, the central bank guided its currency higher again, helping to stabilize the Chinese equity markets. The dollar fetched 6.5915 yuan, down from 6.5956 on Thursday.\n\nEven so, Goldman sticks to its prediction of further devaluation in the coming years based on three factors:\n\n1) Chinese policy makers have enacted a shift in recent days. Over the first four trading days of the year, Beijing allowed the yuan to weaken 0.8%, which is the largest slide over such a period since August, according to Goldman. That was back when the authorities first started to devalue the currency and triggered a global market selloff.\n\n2) Dollar strength and more emphasis on other currencies. Traditionally, Chinese authorities mostly reference the dollar-yuan rate when discussing its currency. However, the China Foreign Exchange Trade System in December announced a wider trade-weighted index to provide a broader view of the yuan's valuation against other rival currencies. The trade-weighted yuan index is forecast to fall 3% over the coming year, Goldman predicted, mainly due to a stronger dollar.\n\n3) More weakness in the year ahead. While data in November showed somewhat of a rebound in the economy, the Goldman analysts suspect it won't last. The improvement came on the back of fiscal stimulus that the analysts said does not look sustainable over the longer term and data from December has already painted a more mixed picture.
Gold finished with a modest loss Wednesday as the U.S. dollar bounced back from Tuesday's slump, dulling investment demand for the dollar-pegged precious metal.\n\nStill, gold futures traded near their highest levels in about two months after data showing that U.S. inflation topped 2% in 2016 and recent comments from President-elect Donald Trump suggested that he favors a weaker greenback for exporters.\n\nGold for February delivery US:GCG7 fell 80 cents, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,212.10 an ounce. The contract climbed 1.4% Tuesday to settle at its highest level since Nov. 17, according to FactSet data.\n\nMeanwhile, silver enjoyed a gain, outperforming its sister metal. March silver US:SIH7 added 12.6 cents, or 0.7%, to $17.274 an ounce.\n\nMarket participants said trading has been subdued with investors awaiting Trump's presidential inauguration ceremony set for Friday.\n\nThere's so much news screaming for attention right now, investors are struggling to tell the signal from the noise, said Adrian Ash, head of research at BullionVault.\n\nTrump's now calling for a weaker dollar but inflation has already breached the Fed's 2% target, he said. That makes gold look good for 2017, because as real interest rates fall, the currency will devalue at a faster rate.\n\nOn Wednesday, data showed that the Consumer Price Index jumped 0.3% in December, matching the MarketWatch forecast. Inflation for 2016 rose by 2.1%â€”the biggest increase since 2011.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.41% was trading up by nearly 0.6% just after gold's settlement, with the index paring its weekly loss down to under 0.3%. Gold and the dollar typically move inversely since a richer greenback cuts demand for the dollar-priced metal from buyers using other currencies.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Friday, Trump said the dollar, which touched a more than 14-year high about two weeks ago, has gotten too strong, as China keeps its own yuan weaker. He said the dollar's strength is impeding the competitiveness of U.S. companies.\n\nRead:Trump is waving adios to the longstanding 'strong dollar policy'\n\nDon't miss:Gold has a lot going for it this yearâ€”and it's not only because of Trump\n\nI don't believe the Trump administration is going to be supportive of a strong dollar, said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter.

SAN FRANCISCO â€” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester on Sunday applauded the U.S. central bank's decision last month to raise short-term rates and said subsequent actions are likely to come at a modest and steady pace.\n\nBased on the economic outlook, I thought it was prudent to take the first step on the path of gradual normalization of interest rates, Mester said in reference to the Fed's move to raise its short-term target rate from near zero levels last month, to a range between 0.25% and 0.50%. The action had been widely expected, and in remarks ahead of the December Fed gathering, Mester had said the U.S. was ready for a boost in borrowing costs.
Bond markets â€” and by association, stocks and the housing market, even gold â€” are hanging in the balance.\n\nAfter a tumultuous few weeks, the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% set several bearish milestones, then topped 2.60% on Thursday to notch a three-year high. Yields rise when prices fall and are telling not only for fixed-income investors and competing assets, but for anyone keeping track of borrowing costs.\n\nFrom here, it's not entirely clear if the bond market selloff has enough momentum to sustain another big move.\n\nIt's easy enough to argue why bond yields should rise. The Treasury Department will unload a deluge of issuance this year, major central banks are set to start a long-awaited shift away from easy money policies and inflation expectations have begun to trickle higher thanks to tight labor markets.\n\nThe market is starting to question whether or not the stories used to explain the flattening yield curve, like how inflation is in check, strong international demand, and all of the things that were going to keep the long end anchored, is valid in the perspective of synchronized global growth, said Marvin Loh, senior fixed-income strategist at BNY Mellon.\n\nInvestors say the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will finally make their much awaited shift away from their ultra-accommodative stance this year. Market participants have pointed the finger at the two central banks for keeping a lid on long-dated Treasury yields, as low-to-negative interest rates spurred a flight of investors from debt of both countries into U.S. government paper.\n\nSee: BOJ and ECB expectations have trader hopes riding high for the yen and the euro\n\nA process of normalization of the global low-yield environment, in turn driven by a re-coupling of monetary policy globally towards a removal of accommodation would ultimately bring up the 10-year yield up to its stable, long-term levels, said strategists at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, in a note.\n\nThough many such calls have turned out to be no more than false alarms, improving economic data in Europe and Japan has reportedly led their central bankers to rethink their policy guidance without spooking markets. Insiders in the Bank of Japan said officials were confident of hitting the 2% inflation target, which has remained frustratingly out of reach, reported the Wall Street Journal.\n\nMarkets are also falling in line with the Federal Reserve's view of future interest rates, a stark change from last year.\n\nBack in 2017, the gulf between the Fed and Wall Street over the appropriate level of interest rates seemed impossible to close. Analysts accused the central bank of risking a policy misstep if it hiked rates when inflation readings persisted below its 2% target. Policymakers including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen stuck to the script that a lack of price pressures would prove fleeting.\n\nThis disconnect kept the 10-year yield depressed as investors wagered for a flattening of the yield curve, the slope of which reflected the spread between short-dated and long-dated bond yields.\n\nBut rising inflation expectations have had investors humming a new tune. A recent Beige Book report showed employers were open to raising wages to attract scarce workers, while higher commodity prices have pushed up breakeven rates, the market-based assessments of inflation prospects.\n\nThe 10-year breakeven rate established a three-year high of 2.09% on Thursday as crude prices moved above $60 a barrel, as the chart below shows.\n\nRising oil prices have stoked inflation expectations. UBS\n\nTraders now estimate the chance of three rate hikes this year to have risen above 50%, according to fed fund futures data. That's in line with the so-callled dot plot, an aggregate of senior Fed officials' projections for interest rates, which showed a median forecast of three hikes in 2018.\n\nOn top of that, a wave of Treasury issuance could swamp bond investors. The Fed's reduction of its balance sheet and the deficit-widening tax cuts could ramp up the federal government's borrowing needs.\n\nRead: Bond market braces for $ 1 trillion tsunami of Treasurys this year\n\nThe supply deluge is unlikely to be a one-off if the budget shortfalls increase at their current pace. The Committee for the Responsible Federal Budget estimated the deficit to push above $1 trillion as early as 2019.\n\nBut Matthew Hornbach of Morgan Stanley said that outside of recessions, only one in four times when the Treasury Department unloaded a wave of supply did yields rise over recent history. Moreover, prices adjust much less on an outright basis when the actual supply hits the market than when expectations for an influx of supply started to build, he said. Forward-looking investors already had a strong inkling of upcoming bond issuance.\n\nHornbach's point highlights how many of the factors blamed for the bond selloff were also present toward the tail end of last year. Nonetheless, the 10-year yield ended largely where it began 2017.\n\nWe know all this, and have for a while, and that the price action that starts the new year, which is seasonally habitually bearish even in bull markets, is not necessarily prologue, said David Ader, chief market strategist for Informa Intelligence, in a note.\n\nIt's tempting to dismiss the recent turn in bearish sentiment as a rite of spring, and that the pace at which yields have climbed has taken the move beyond its moorings.\n\nBut forecasts, including from Goldman Sachs and Nomura, were already predicting bonds to come under pressure in the first quarter of 2018, but perhaps not at this disorienting speed. The 10-year yield gained more than 20 basis points in January.\n\nIf the move may have been too fast, it has not gone too far, said strategists at Deutsche Bank.\n\nAll the same, a short-term pullback could be on the cards, and even more so, if debt ceiling negotiations hit an impasse, as they did in the government shutdown. Appetite for U.S. government paper could suffer if credit ratings agencies see the political brinkmanship as a reason to strip away the U.S.'s gold-plated, triple-A credit rating.
Casual observers of the bond market know that emerging market issuers and corporate paper tend to sport higher yields than Treasurys mostly because of differing perceptions of creditworthiness.\n\nBut that gap might not matter that much for even the riskiest of issuers, with heated demand for yield dragging borrowing costs for emerging market corporate debt down to pre-2008 levels. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Emerging Market Corporate Bond spread, which measures the premium paid for owning bonds sold by corporations in developing markets against safer Treasurys, has compressed to 3.3 percentage points, the tightest since July 2007 (see chart below).\n\nEmerging market credit spreads are falling to the tightest levels since 2007 Charlie Bilello; Pension Partners\n\nThis narrowing gap demonstrates the continued rising tide of money flowing around the globe. This wave of cash has also swept into high-yield bonds, securitized debt and even dicey financial products many of which served as ground zero for the 2007-2009 financial crisis.\n\nThe steady inflows this year have pulled down yields for emerging market corporate bonds, pushing prices up to expensive levels. But in the risk-hungry environment, the positive yields on offer in emerging market corporate debt compared with the diminished rewards of owning European paper have made them a natural target for those chasing returns.\n\nAs the period immediately prior to the financial crisis demonstrates, it is possible for credit spreads to fall below current levels without investors immediately becoming concerned that they are excessively low, said Oliver Jones, a markets economist for Capital Economics.\n\nForeign investors plowed around $170 billion into the assets in 2017, up from $99 billion in 2016, according to data from the Institute of International Finance, a global financial industry trade group\n\nThe iShares J.P. Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF EMB, -1.36% , one of the largest exchange-traded funds to track the sector, has seen inflows of $880 million so far in the new year, according to FactSet, second only to the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF JNK, -0.72% among inflows into fixed-income products. Another fund, the VanEck Vectors J.P. Morgan EM Local Currency Bond ETF EMLC, -0.92% , has seen inflows of $165.4 million, also putting it in the top 10 of bond ETF inflows in the early days of 2018.\n\nIssuers have taken advantage of the solid demand. Total sales of emerging market corporate bonds neared $500 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nBut the enthusiasm for the asset class isn't just a reflection of investing fervor, but springs from genuine sources.\n\nFitch Ratings said emerging market corporations flogging bonds were seeing a rapid improvement in their finances. The net percentage of issuers with a positive outlook versus a negative one has risen to its highest levels since 2013 (see chart below). Credit ratings firms tag an issuer with a positive outlook as a prelude to a potential upgrade.\n\nRatings for emerging market corporate debt are seeing an uptick Fitch Ratings\n\nEmerging markets have profited from two major trends sweeping across the world. Global growth has perked up, with the Markit global composite purchasing manufacturer's index hitting a 3-year high of around 54.3 last week. A figure of more than 50 indicates an expansion of private-sector activity. The boost to industrial activity has strengthened demand for commodities, a mainstay for developing-market economies.\n\nMoreover, a weaker dollar has allowed bond investors to reap the additional gains of strengthening domestic currencies, juicing their returns.\n\nBut emerging market investors might be feeling remorse at the end of the year if the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy beyond its own projections for three hikes in 2018.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario, tighter monetary policy could spur the dollar's rebound and hasten investors' flight out of emerging markets as the difference between interest rates in emerging markets and the U.S. narrow, said analysts at Fitch Ratings.\n\nA stronger greenback could leave corporate issuers in these far-flung nations struggling to pay their dollar-denominated debts if their profits come from local currencies.
There's no shortage of stupid things in investing these days.\n\nAmong them:\n\nâ€¢ Bitcoin\n\nâ€¢ Litecoin\n\nâ€¢ Pizzacoin\n\nâ€¢ Canadian real estate\n\nâ€¢ Swedish real estate\n\nâ€¢ Australian real estate\n\nâ€¢ FAANG\n\nâ€¢ Venture capital\n\nBut European bonds are potentially the stupidest. Maybe even stupider than bitcoin!\n\nYou've probably seen charts of European high-yield bonds floating around â€” yields in the low 2s for BB credits. There was also a European corporate issuer that managed to issue BBB bonds at negative yields a few weeks ago.\n\nI think that might have been the top.\n\nAlthough there is nothing stupid about it â€” the ECB has been buying every bond in sight, and there's lots of money to be made front-running central banks.\n\nHow will the ECB exit?\n\nStill, it's possible that we've reached the logical limit of emergency monetary policy, and the European Central Bank is going to have to exit sometime in the near future.\n\nThe question is: How are they going to exit without blowing up the bond market?\n\nBitcoin vs. regulators: Who will win?\n\nAnd it's not just the European bond market. The effects have been transmitted to other bond markets as well, like our own. If the ECB exits, or, heaven forbid, the Bank of Japan tries to exit at the same time â€” and screws it up â€” there is a potential for a real meltdown.\n\nWhat would a meltdown look like?\n\nFact: Any time 10-year yields have backed up 200 basis points, there has been a crisis. You have to go back to 1994 for the last one. And we even had a mini-crisis in 2013, which we called the taper tantrum.\n\nIf tens backed up from 2.3% to 4.3%, it would be a crisis of gargantuan proportions.\n\nWhat is the probability that it will happen?\n\nToday's yields are not worth the risk\n\nIt's tough to think of these things in terms of probabilities. For example, it's very probable that the ECB will begin its exit next year. But what is the probability that they screw it up?\n\nIt's literally impossible to handicap. You can't quantify it. But again: crowded theater, small exit. So you know the unwind has the potential to be disorderly if the ECB is careless about how they exit.\n\nAnyone who has seen markets in action (at least, for a decade or more) knows that selling can lead to more selling, which can lead to more selling, otherwise known as a cascading effect. Nobody under 30 knows what this looks like.\n\nI actually had a funny conversation with some high-yield guys a few weeks ago. They were laughing at one of their junior traders, who was getting a bit panicked as he watched the index sell off â€¦ by 1 point. This is getting out of control, he said.\n\nI am not much interested in the bond market until you get tens to 4, investment grade to 7, and high yield to 12. I will turn into High Yield Harry if you get yields out to 12%.\n\nThose sound like impossible levels, but you just have to dream a little bigger, dear readers.\n\nRemember: Cash is an option to buy something cheaper in the future. If yields do get out to 12%, and you don't have the cash to take advantage of it, you are going to be kicking your own butt all the way down the street.\n\nHow to play when things go sour\n\nIt is waaaaay too early to be thinking about this, but â€¦\n\nIf you were to try and pick a bottom in the throes of a bear market, it is a lot smarter to do it in the high-yield market than the stock market.\n\nIt's hard to get hurt too badly when you're getting paid 12%-14% to wait for a bottom.\n\nStocks are a different story. Stocks can go down forever. In 2009, it really seemed like they were going down forever. That is too scary for me.\n\nBut I really like buying credit in bear markets, and I also like buying converts. Go back and look at high-yield and convert mutual funds coming out of bear markets.\n\nYou're talking about 30%-40% returns, especially on the lower-quality stuff. On a risk-adjusted basis, it's a lot better than stocks.\n\nIn the meantime, there is nothing to do.\n\nJared Dillian is a former Lehman Brothers head of ETF trading.

A hawkish tone from a key U.S. central banker could be adding to the market's poor start to 2016.\n\nOn Sunday, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said the U.S. central bank should be open, in the future, to raising interest rates to ward off potential asset bubbles.\n\nHow much financial stability concerns should play in monetary policy remains an unsettled policy at the U.S. central bank. Prior to the crisis, the Fed's leadership did not support hiking rates to ward off asset bubbles.\n\nIn a note to clients, David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff, said Fischer's hint of more rate adjustments may be adding to the market angst. The Dow industrials fell as much as 467 points on Monday.\n\nIn his speech, Fischer said the U.S. central bank would still face significant hurdles if it had to cut rates back to zero.\n\nInnovative ideas for how to get around the zero lower bound are full of potential problems, the Fed Vice Chairman said.\n\nFor instance, raising the Fed's inflation target above 2%, an idea proposed by Olivier Blanchard, the former IMF chief economist, may lead to higher swings in inflation, which could have damaging consequences for the economy, Fischer said.\n\nAnother idea, for the Fed to use negative rates, faces transitional problems similar to Y2K bug in 2000, Fischer said.\n\nAlso read:Bernanke says Fed likely to add negative interest rates to recession-fighting tool kit\n\nThis would make a move to negative rates difficult to implement on short notice, he said.\n\nTo avoid moving back to the zero lower bound, Fischer said the government could move to boost the equilibrium real interest rates â€” the rate consistent with the Fed's goals of low unemployment and 2% inflation. The Fed vice chairman said this rate will remain low for the policy-relevant future.\n\nFischer said expansionary fiscal policy would boost this rate.
Treasury yields declined on Wednesday as details about President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy proposals weren't forthcoming at the President-elect's first news conference since the election. Instead, Trump addressed recent allegations that his campaign staff had been in contact with the Russian government, and that Russia's spy agencies had compromising information on the president-elect. A Trump lawyer also focused on how Trump would handle several conflicts of interest related to his business holdings. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note [s:TMUBMUSD10Y] fell two basis points to 3.658%, while the two-year yield [s:TMUBMUSD02Y] fell 1.4 basis point to 1.179%. The 30-year yield [s:TMUBMUSD30Y] fell two basis points to 2.948%.
From time to time, more often during economic crises than periods of calm, financial gurus dredge up that old saw claiming that the Federal Reserve has lost control of financial markets.\n\nThat assertion always inspires more curiosity than angst, namely because I never viewed the Fed as controller-in-chief. Does the Fed have influence over financial markets? You bet. Does it exert guidance? Both verbal and non-verbal â€” and sometimes too much of the verbal variety, to which markets may turn a deaf ear. But absolute control? Sorry. You can't lose what you never had to begin with.\n\nStrong Global Growth Down to Easy Money Says IMF\n\nWhat the Fed controls is the overnight interbank lending rate, known as the federal funds rate, by buying or selling Treasury securities to adjust the supply of reserves in the banking system. (The Fed's program of paying interest on excess reserves is irrelevant for purposes of this discussion.)\n\nThe overnight rate has a definite, albeit unquantifiable, effect on financial-asset prices, economic activity (via its influence on aggregate demand) and ultimately inflation. And while monetary policy is more potent than fiscal policy, the impact of any given change in the funds rate and, hence, the money supply varies from business cycle to business cycle. Which is why even the best monetary rule argues for a bit of discretion in its implementation.\n\nIt is true that adjustments in the overnight rate, up or down, generally drive long-term interest rates in the same direction. But not always. Long-term rates have other priorities to consider, including the path of the overnight rate going forward, inflation expectations, and the perceived risk of holding a 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% versus rolling over a short-term T-bill TMUBMUSD03M, 0.012% .\n\nWhen market rates don't follow the funds rate, it is less a function of a loss of control on the part of the Fed than of a difference of opinion with the Fed. What appears to be an unruly child misbehaving is often a wise man casting doubt on the Fed's monetary stance. That's why the juxtaposition of the Fed-controlled overnight rate and a market-determined long-term rate is such a potent and reliable representation of the stance of monetary policy.\n\nUntil recently, long-term rates had pretty much ignored the Fed's five, quarter-point rate increases since December 2015. It was only last week that the yield on the 10-year note breached its 2017 high before rising to 2.67% on Monday, a rate last seen in mid-2014.\n\nStill, there is little evidence that long-term rates are incorporating the Fed's forecasts for three rate increases this year and two next, as outlined in its summary of economic projections from December.\n\nLong-term rates aren't the only rebels. Proponents of the Fed-has-lost-control theory point to a general loosening of financial conditions as exemplified by a weaker dollar BUXX, +0.05% , soaring stock market and historically narrow credit spreads.\n\nThe increased appetite for stocks and high-yield bonds is a reflection of the Fed's aggressive stimulus actions during and after the Great Recession.\n\nIn fact, it was the Fed's stated goal, as outlined by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Based on a concept known as the portfolio balance channel, Bernanke explained that, with the funds rate close to zero, the central bank buys long-term, risk-free assets, such as Treasuries, lowering the rates and encouraging investors to buy riskier, higher-yielding assets, such as stocks and corporate bonds. (Central bankers never quite explain the consequences when those trades unwind.)\n\nEven now, Treasury yields remain historically low, which in part is a manifestation of the low natural rate required to keep the economy growing at its diminished potential.\n\nWhen one compares risk-free yields with the double-digit increases in the major U.S. stock indexes last year â€” 19.4% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index SPX, -1.48% , 25.1% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% and 28.2% for the Nasdaq COMP, -3.02% â€” it seems that the incentive to pile into riskier assets is still in effect, especially in light of the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\n\nWhen it comes to the dollar's weakness DXY, -0.03% against major currencies over the past year, reasons abound, including everything from an improved growth outlook for foreign economies and diminished need for stimulus to rising commodity prices to Washington's dysfunction to President Donald Trump's low standing in the world.\n\nThe Fed's counterparts overseas have an equal say when comes to the foreign-exchange value of the U.S. dollar, not to mention fiscal policy, politics and a host of other factors.\n\nBesides, financial conditions are a coincident, not a leading, indicator. They are loose until they tighten, which they do during downturns. The motivation for recession comes from the Fed, which pushes up the funds rate too far until it exceeds the yield on long-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inverted curve. That's a huge disincentive for banks, which typically borrow short and lend long.\n\nAnd it's why it is a mistake to look at long-term rates in isolation. What matters is their interaction with the policy rate. The fed funds/10-year spread has narrowed from an ultra-wide 365 basis points in 2010 to 120 basis points today, which still provides an incentive to depository institutions. The failure of long rates to match the Fed's rate increases means the Fed has less room to tighten policy, especially as the effects of balance-sheet reduction start to kick in.\n\nThe next time you hear someone say that the Fed has lost control of financial markets, please tell her long rates ain't misbehavin'. They're just doing their job.
Despite the partial government shutdown, it should (mostly) be business as usual for students relying on federal student loans to afford college and borrowers repaying them.\n\nThe Department of Education remains fully funded, which means its contractors are still collecting student loan payments and the agency is still dispersing grants and federal student loans. Still, students, borrowers and schools may experience some hiccups for tasks that require information from another agency experiencing greater impacts from the shutdown, like the IRS.\n\nIt's the other departments that are running into some issues, said Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of savingforcollege.com and a financial aid expert.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nBorrowers repaying their student loans\n\nPerhaps the most important thing that borrowers who are repaying their student loans should know is that the shutdown doesn't affect their student loan bills.\n\nBorrowers should be operating as if everything is normal and there is no disruption at all, said Justin Draeger, the president of the National Association of Financial Aid Administrators, a professional association for financial aid officers. In other words: Don't stop paying your loans, he says.\n\nStill, the shutdown could impact some borrowers trying to manage their debt. Borrowers who want to take advantage of the government's income-driven repayment plans, which allow them to pay off their debt as a percentage of their income, need to show proof of income to their student loan servicer. They also need to recertify their income every year to stay on the plans.\n\nThe IRS, which has had many of its duties curtailed due to the shutdown, typically plays a role in both cases. Usually, borrowers will use the IRS data retrieval tool, which electronically transfers tax information into their income driven repayment plan application. Department of Education officials say the tool is operating as normal. The IRS did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nBorrowers applying for an income-driven repayment plan or re-certifying their income for an IDR plan should try to use the data retrieval tool, Kantrowitz said. If for some reason, they hit a snag â€” the tools don't always run perfectly, he noted â€” under normal circumstances a borrower would download their tax transcript from the IRS and file a paper application.\n\nBut the tax transcript service is currently down. Officials at the Department of Education and the IRS told Politico the outage isn't due to the shutdown and they expect the tool to be back up on January 14. In the meantime, while the shutdown persists, borrowers trying to get their tax information will likely struggle to find someone to take their calls at the IRS, Kantrowitz said.\n\nBorrowers whose circumstances have changed since they last filed their tax return â€” information that won't be reflected in the data retrieval tool â€” can use other documentation to prove their income, like pay stubs or a letter from their employer. But because those documents typically show net income and not gross income â€” which is available through tax documents and on which the calculation for income-driven repayment plans are usually based â€” borrowers' loan payments could wind up being higher, Kantrowitz said.\n\nStudents applying for and receiving aid\n\nThe lack of availability of tax transcripts is also causing a snag for some students applying for aid, experts say. Roughly 30% of students who fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, are flagged for verification each year, a process that requires them to prove their income. Typically these students use a tax transcript to verify their income.\n\nBasically there's a big bottleneck in the process at this point, said David Baime, the senior vice president for government relations and policy analysis at the American Association of Community Colleges.\n\nBaime said his organization has heard from its member schools with great concern about students unable to complete their FAFSA due to the tax transcript issue. Unfortunately, this issue is likely affecting students who need the funds the most â€” college officials say they observe that low-income students are more likely to be flagged for verification. In some cases, colleges are working with students to allow them to start the semester in the absence of financing until the issues are resolved, Baime said.\n\nThe bottom line is that our colleges â€” and their students more importantly â€” are really in many places in a very difficult situation in terms of financing, Baime said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a day after this story was originally published, the Department of Education released guidance on alternative documents students flagged for verification could use to prove their income to their schools during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 application cycles. (Department of Education officials had announced at a conference in November that they were looking at making these changes.)\n\nUnder the Department's new guidance, students and families who were flagged for verification and have difficulty obtaining their tax transcript can use a signed copy of their 2016 or 2017 income tax return to prove their income.\n\nStudents and families who aren't required to file a tax return still need to attempt to get verification from the IRS that they're non-filers, but if that's unavailable, they can submit a sworn statement to their school indicating they couldn't get the documentation, didn't file a 2016 or 2017 tax return, a list of income from work and the sources of the income and finally a copy of a W-2 for each source of work listed.\n\nDraeger said in an email that colleges were ecstatic about the new guidance and eager to get students out of the financial aid limbo they've been experiencing since the IRS transcript request services went down, unannounced, a few weeks ago.\n\nSchools will move quickly to contact affected students, verify their income or tax filing status using the new guidance, and get them the financial aid for which they qualify, he wrote.\n\nQuestions on the FAFSA that require interactions with other agencies are also causing hiccups for some students and schools. In order to qualify for federal financial aid, male students need to register for the draft. The FAFSA typically performs a database match with the Selective Service Administration to make sure required students have registered, but right now that match is failing, Draeger said. Colleges are able to look students up individually to make sure they're registered, he said.\n\nDespite these challenges, for the most part, students shouldn't see any effect on their financial aid during the shutdown, Draeger said.\n\nThe Department [of Education] is funded, federal student aid dollars are flowing, he said.\n\nGovernment workers affected by the shutdown\n\nThough most student loan borrowers aren't impacted by the shutdown, those who belong to the group of government workers that are furloughed and not receiving a paycheck may be struggling to make their monthly payments.\n\nThe Department of Education advises borrowers for whom that's the case to contact their student loan servicer to discuss their repayment options.\n\nAdam Minsky, a Boston-based student loan lawyer, suggests government workers who are furloughed and on an income-driven plan apply to have their monthly payments reduced based on their changed circumstances. If possible, they should resist entering a forbearance â€” a temporary status that pauses payments, but where interest accrues.\n\nEntering forbearance could wind up costing borrowers more in the long run both because interest capitalizes at the end of a forbearance period and because any time spent in forbearance delays progress towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which allows borrowers working in public service, including for the federal government, to have their loans forgiven after at least 10 years of payments.\n\nThis story was updated on Jan. 9, 2019.
There's the language of love â€” and then there's the language of Wall Street.\n\nSayings such as catch a falling knife or shoot first, ask questions later aren't quite sweet nothings, but they do make colorful sound bites. Whether you're just flirting with investing or head-over-heels for the stock market, you'll eventually hear some phrases that give you pause.\n\nWhat the dickens do Wall Street veterans mean when they say these things? Here's a guide to common stock jargon.\n\nIt was the best of timesâ€¦\n\nBuy the dip, often abbreviated as BTD or BTFD (you can likely deduce what the F means): Half legitimate strategy, half jokey catchphrase, you'll often find this referenced on social media. The idea is to buy an asset when its price dips â€” provided you believe the price will rise again. That being said, trying to time the market might cost you.\n\nMore room to run: Someone who uses this bit of market jargon believes that prices will go higher â€” basically, the good times aren't over yet.\n\nTaking profits (or profit-taking): This is a fancy way of saying you sold an asset (and made money). This phrase can also describe a dip in a stock price during a period when it's otherwise appreciating â€” a phenomenon sometimes attributed to investors taking their profits.\n\nCheck out: MarketWatch and Learn: How to buy stocks, bonds, and mutual funds\n\nGreen shoots: Think the early signs of spring. This phrase commonly references signs of the beginning of economic growth.\n\nIt was the worst of timesâ€¦\n\nDead cat bounce: Not an ideal scenario in any usage. Chart-watchers use this phrase after a stock price takes a sharp fall, then rebounds a bit. The idea is that any recovery will be short-lived.\n\nCatch a falling knife: This is a way to describe the perils of investing. When a stock's price is plummeting, potential buyers could be in for a rude awakening if still more declines are coming.\n\nFrothy: Picture a drink topped with bubbles. In Wall Street talk, frothy is another way of saying prices are unsustainably high.\n\nRush for the exits: This phrase describes what happens when people panic and sell their stocks at the beginning of a market decline, exacerbating the severity of the selloff.\n\nIt was the most confusing of timesâ€¦\n\nDon't fight the Fed: No fisticuffs here. This bit of advice endorses accepting Federal Reserve policy, so your portfolio benefits from such changes, rather than resisting (and likely losing money).\n\nBuy the rumor, sell the news: This saying is more relevant to day traders than long-term investors. There are occasionally short-term trading opportunities surrounding rumors â€” be it economic reports, company-specific announcements or other developments. Buying when the rumor surfaces (and prices are still low) can benefit traders when the news appears and lifts prices.\n\nDon't miss: Day trading: should you try it?\n\nShoot first, ask questions later (or: Sell now, ask questions later): This describes a situation less serious than a rush for the exits. It means sellers are motivated to get out â€” even if they don't yet fully understand why.\n\nA stock picker's market: This is a favorite among fund managers who pick individual stocks for a living. It refers to a period in which investors who buy individual stocks fare better than those in passive investments, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Unfortunately for stock pickers, their approach often falls short over the long term.\n\nPullback (usually accompanied by words such as healthy, good, normal, etc.): Pullback is Wall Street jargon for a decline. Pairing it with a word such as healthy or normal is a way for investors to say a decline in a stock's price is just fine â€” it'll go up again soon enough.\n\nWindow dressing: Retailers aren't the only ones who put on a show around the holidays to entice shoppers. Fund managers may make some late-quarter tweaks to appeal to investors, selling losing investments and buying winners.\n\nWall of worry: There's a lot to worry about, but everything will be OK. This phrase suggests investors can overcome bad news to push stock prices higher again. It's not as simple as more room to run, however â€” there may be some barriers.\n\nThe market doesn't move in a straight line: In case you haven't noticed yet, stock prices move up and down â€” and that's normal. Investors have come up with numerous ways to say just that.\n\nIt's already priced in: Because the market is forward-looking, information that's already known â€” projections for a company's revenue or earnings in a future quarter, for example â€” is taken into account in stock prices. If markets were as efficient as this phrase suggests, however, there wouldn't be a need for all this other jargon.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:
The partial government shutdown is now setting records, and investors might not be able to ignore it for much longer, analysts said.\n\nTwo key risks that we highlighted in the past (Fed's monetary policy and trade war) have subsided, but new risks have emerged: U.S. government shutdown and signs of additional slowdown outside the U.S., wrote Marko Kolanovic, global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy at JPMorgan, in a Wednesday note.\n\nRead:The government shutdown has become the longest on record\n\nHistory shows past shutdowns have had a negligible impact on stocks. So far, that's been the case with the partial shutdown that began on Dec. 21 and entered its 26th day on Wednesday with no end in sight with congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump at an impasse over his demand for funding for a $5.3 billion border wall. The closure has far exceeded the prior record, a 21-day shutdown during the Clinton administration that began in December 1995.\n\nRead:Trump on conference call with supporters: 'We'll be out [on shutdown] for a long time'\n\nSince Dec. 21, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% rallied 8% through Tuesday's close as stocks bounced back from a December selloff that took the index below 2,400 on Christmas Eve before giving way to a rebound that saw the large-cap index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% exit correction territory.\n\nThe rebound has been attributed in part to a softer tone from the Federal Reserve when it comes to future rate increases, efforts by China to stimulate its economy, and a relative lack of negative news surrounding the U.S.-China trade spat. But analysts and others have begun to warn that the shutdown could begin to have a negative economic impact that poses to be a drag on the market.\n\nBad things come in threes, or so goes the old saying, and the government shutdown looks like the third in a series of a policy missteps that have undermined the expansion and pushed the probability of a recession to the highest level since early 2007, said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, in a Wednesday note, citing New York Federal Reserve Bank data.\n\nThe other missteps include the trade battle with China, which has undercut the benefits of the corporate tax cuts, and the Federal Reserve's belief that the effect on term yields from the pace of [its balance-sheet reduction] was somehow immune to a doubling of the budget deficit, he said.\n\nBlitz expects the U.S. and China will reach a lasting truce, the Fed will recalibrate the pace of its balance-sheet runoff and the government, of course, will reopen. What matters is the timing of these developments in determining how quickly markets respond before greater damage is done to the economy, he said.\n\nOthers have questioned whether the shutdown itself would be enough to affect underlying economic trends.\n\nThe White House has reportedly doubled its own estimate of the shutdown's impact on economic growth, news reports said Tuesday, forecasting it would trim first-quarter gross domestic product by 0.5 percentage points if it lasts through January.\n\nThe White House's estimates also don't allow for any negative impact through business and consumer confidence in general, which is another source of downside risk, noted Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. However, there is so far little evidence that market sentiment has suffered so far, he said, in a note.\n\nRead:Kudlow must explain to Trump that shutdown is hurting economist, says strategist\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported that some senior White House officials are privately advising Trump to find a way to end the shutdown. The officials are worried that the president hasn't realized the severity of 800,000 federal workers missing paychecks, one official told the newspaper.\n\nGregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, estimated the shutdown would shave 0.2 percentage points off first-quarter GDP if it lasts through January, which would bring the firm's GDP tracker down to 1.9% annualized growth. If it lasts through the end of March, it would shave off 0.6 percentage point, slowing the pace of growth to 1.5%, he said.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who's been upbeat on the U.S. economy, warned Tuesday that the partial shutdown could wipe out growth if it lasts the entire quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, the shutdown has deprived traders, economists and policy makers of at least 10 key government data releases so far, including figures related to housing, trade and consumer spending, Daco said, adding that even when the government reopens, it will likely take months to return to a normal schedule.\n\nIf anything, this lack of data will favor an even-more cautious approach from the Fed when it comes to normalizing monetary policy. This is particularly true since the latest inflation data (which comes from the funded Bureau of Labor Statistics) shows no imminent risk of an outbreak, he said.
The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates as many as four times this year, going beyond what is currently expected by most investors, Goldman Sachs's chief economist Jan Hatzius said on Monday.\n\nSpeaking at a conference in London, Hatzius said there's a 35% chance of a rate hike in March, placing a higher probability of an imminent increase than the broader market. According to the CME FedWatch tool, Fed fund futures are currently pricing in a 24% chance of rate jump in March.\n\nWe are seeing upward pressure on wage growth, upward pressure on core inflation. We expect further monetary policy normalization from the Federal Reserve to a degree that goes beyond what is priced into the bond market, Goldman's chief economist said.\n\nSo for 2017 we're looking for three hikes from the Fed as a baseline. In June, in September and December. There is some possibility, 35%, for a March hike, he said.\n\nSee also: Goldman Sachs's chief economist warns of 3 key risks in 2017\n\nThe Fed raised interest rates in December for the second time in a decade and penciled in three moves this year. The next rate rise is now seen in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. However, after the strong wage growth seen in the December jobs report out on Friday economists are increasingly seeing a March hike as a possibility too.\n\nIan Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, for example, said on Friday he thinks rates will rise again as soon as March, provided there is some clarification of President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy program by then.\n\nLooking further ahead, Hatzius said the market is too slow at pricing in the speed of rate hikes.\n\nAs we go into 2019-2020, when most people predict the end of the rate hike cycle, we're forecasting 3.5%, whereas the market is priced for only 2%. We are generally ahead of the market as far as interest rates are concerned, he said.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nBoston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Monday said that economic circumstances have evolved and now imply the need for a different stance of monetary policy. That calls for somewhat more regular increases in short-term interest rates, he said.
A measure of volatility on Wall Street on Monday rose to its highest level in more than 5 months as U.S. equity benchmarks dipped and as the yield in a benchmark Treasury note climbed to its highest level in more than three years. The CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% was up about 18% at 13.03, marking its highest level since Aug. 18, 2017, according to FactSet data. The VIX uses bullish and bearish option bets on the S&P 500 index to reflect expected volatility over the coming 30 days, and it typically rises as stocks fall. However, the gauge, sometimes referred to as the fear index, has been abnormally low, trading below its historical average at around 20. To be sure, it is still holding at a level below that historic mean but its recent pick up suggests that investors are betting that volatility will accelerate over the coming days and months. A rise in 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% above 2.71% also has drawn attention, because rising rates can undercut appetite for stocks if government paper offer richer yields than risk assets like stocks. Rising yields, President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's updated policy statement on Wednesday and a bevy of earnings set to be released throughout the week could induce choppy trade in an otherwise subdued market. The three main equity benchmarks were under pressure Monday afternoon, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% off 100 points, or 0.4%, at 26,517, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% retreated by 0.4% at 2,862. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% , sometimes viewed as a proxy for risk appetite, was trading 0.3% lower at 7,483. That said, the uptrend for stocks remains intact with all three benchmarks looking at a monthly return of more than 7%.
Only a couple of the 17 top Federal Reserve officials pushed for the central bank to expand its purchases of longer-term bonds during the their meeting in December, according to minutes of the discussion released Wednesday.\n\nThe Fed has been buying $40 billion of Treasurys per month since June, with the purchases coming across the yield curve. Many economists have argued that concentrating the purchases on the long-end of the curve would add more stimulus to the economy.\n\nThe central bank is also buying $40 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities.\n\nAhead of the Fed meeting, many economists thought the Fed would decide to concentrate more on the longer-end of the yield curve, but the actual support for the support for the move in the meeting was small.\n\nFed officials generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation, according to the minutes.\n\nSome Fed officials left open the possibility of weighing purchases of Treasurys toward the longer end if necessary, the minutes said.\n\nA few officials said it was important that the Fed continue to evaluate balance of the costs and risks of the purchases against the benefits.\n\nAt the meeting, the Fed adopted guidance on the asset purchases, saying the increases in asset holdings would continue until substantial further progress has been made toward reaching the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.\n\nFed officials generally said that substantial progress was not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds.\n\nMany Fed officials noted that the Fed should tell markets clearly its assessment of progress well in advance of the time when the central bank might change the pace of the purchases.\n\nLooming behind this was concern about another taper tantrum when just a brief mention of the possibility of slowing down asset purchases by then Fed-chairman Ben Bernanke caused a rout in the Treasury market in 2013.\n\nThe Fed said that once the progress was achieved, it would slowly taper the purchases similar to the slow pace during the last program of 2013 and 2014.
Shares in Asia rose modestly on Monday, extending gains on Wall Street last week. Buying enthusiasm was spurred by renewed hopes for progress on resolving the trade standoff between the U.S. and China. Shares rose in Shanghai and Hong Kong early Monday despite news that China's economy grew at its lowest pace in three decades last year.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.17% closed up 0.6% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index HSI, +0.49% climbed 0.3%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.18% rose 0.3%. South Korea's Kospi 180721, -0.82% was almost flat and the S&P ASX 200 XJO, -0.80% in Australia added 0.2%. Shares rose in Southeast Asia and Taiwan XX:Y9999 .\n\nAmong individual stocks, Nissan 7201, -1.27% rose slightly as former chairman Carlos Ghosn renewed an attempt for bail. Electronics maker TDK 6762, +1.40% and Takeda Pharmeceutical 4502, +2.17% were among Tokyo's biggest gainers. In Hong Kong, shares of Sunny Optical 2382, +0.33% surged while fellow Apple component maker AAC 2018, +0.47% fell. In Australia, Treasury Wine Estates TWE, -0.72% stock jumped after announcing its chief operating officer had left the company due to a breach of internal policies.\n\nChina on Monday announced its economy expanded by 6.6% over a year earlier, down from 2017's 6.9%. Growth in the three months ending in December cooled to 6.4% from the previous quarter's 6.5%. China's communist leaders are trying to steer China to slower, more self-sustaining growth based on consumer spending instead of trade and investment. But the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting Beijing to ease lending controls and step up government spending to shore up growth and avoid politically dangerous job losses. The lackluster data raised hopes for more policy action.\n\nStock benchmarks in the U.S. and Europe jumped Friday after Bloomberg News reported that Chinese officials offered to buy more goods and services from the U.S., potentially eliminating its trade deficit by 2024. On Wednesday the Chinese government said the top trade envoys from both countries will meet at the end of January. The U.S. trade deficit with China grew to a record $323.3 billion in 2018. The two countries have raised taxes on billions of dollars of each other's goods in the spat over the trade deficit, Beijing's manufacturing plans, and U.S. complaints that China steals technology from foreign companies.\n\nThe scrutiny remains on U.S.-China trade even as no scheduled announcements or meetings are expected. After seeing Wall Street enthused by reports of the U.S. considering lifting tariffs on Friday, the weekend delivered another dose of positivity for markets. This came in the form of reports suggesting that China had offered a path to eliminate trade imbalances with the U.S. in their early January talk in China, Jingyi Pan of IG said in a commentary.\n\nOn Friday, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% climbed 1.3% to 2,670.71 and the Dow Jones industrial average DJIA, -0.39% climbed 1.4% to 24,706.35. The Nasdaq composite COMP, +0.09% added 1% to 7,157.23. Stock indexes have surged since reaching a low point on Christmas Eve, as the S&P 500 has risen for four weeks in a row. It climbed 2.9% last week. It's risen at least 1.9% every week during that rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 5.9% and the S&P 500 index has risen 6.5% so far this year, a surprisingly strong showing coming off a punishing end to 2018. U.S. stock and bond markets will be closed Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday.\n\nU.S. crude US:CLG9 rose modestly to $54.06 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 3.3 percent on Friday to $53.80 in New York. Brent crude UK:LCOH9 , used to price international oils, picked up 16 cents to $62.86 per barrel. It added 2.5 percent to $62.70 a barrel in London on Friday.
Many world leaders condemned the pro-Trump protesters overrunning the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday to protest the election of Joe Biden.\n\nAs images of tear gas being deployed inside the halls of Congress to quell the violence began making the rounds on social media, some of America's closest allies expressed shock and dismay.\n\nDisgraceful scenes in U.S. Congress, tweeted U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the Toronto Star that the Canadian government was watching the situation minute-by-minute.\n\nObviously we're concerned and we're following â€¦ the situation as it unfolds, he said. There is an important electoral process unfolding in the United States and I think we all want it and need it to unfold properly and peacefully. And so we certainly hope things will calm down.\n\nSee:Presidential election confirmation paused in Congress after protesters storm Capitol building in Washington\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel released a video blaming Trump for creating an atmosphere that encouraged the Capitol riot. These images made me furious and also sad, and I'm quite sure I feel like most friends of the United States, like millions of people who admire America's democratic tradition, she said. And I regret very much that President Trump since November has not conceded his defeat, and not yesterday either.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that we believe in Democracy, and warned that, When, in one of the world's oldest democracies, supporters of an outgoing president take up arms to challenge the legitimate results of an election, that one idea â€” that of 'one person, one vote' â€” is undermined.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, weighed in with The rampage of the Capitol building in Washington was a disgraceful act, and it must be condemned.

While these scenes are very difficult to watch, I have faith in our democratic process and know that the important work of Congress will continue and that people will be held accountable for their actions. I pray this situation can be resolved without further bloodshed.\n\nGoldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon said the attack on the US Capitol damages democracy: It's time for all Americans to come together and move forward with a peaceful transition of power. We have to begin reinvesting in our democracy and rebuilding the institutions that have made America an exceptional nation.\n\nBlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, added: I condemn in the strongest possible terms the violence at our Capitol today. This is an assault on our nation, our democracy, and the will of the American people. The peaceful transfer of power is the foundation of our democracy. We are who we are as a nation because of our democratic institutions and process.
Treasury prices rose on Tuesday, driving yields lower, after President-elect Donald Trump dismissed House Republicans' border tax plan as too complicated.\n\nTrump's comments, which appeared in The Wall Street Journal, suggested that the incoming administration could clash with congressional Republicans over the finer points of its broad-strokes policy proposals, possibly delayingâ€”or derailingâ€”their implementation, market strategists said.\n\nThe biggest issue [for the Treasury market] is going to be when Trump comes in what policies will we get and how quickly will we get them in place, said Larry Milstein, managing director of government and agency trading at R.W.

The yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.455% fell 4.6 basis points to 2.930%. Tuesday's decline was the second largest of the year.\n\nOutside of the U.S., British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that the U.K. wants a clean break from the European Union, including leaving the so-called single market and customs union, which would allow the country to exercise tighter controls over its borders.\n\nThe market's reaction to May's remarks revived the notion that most of the strongest impulses affecting the Treasury market will be a consequence of other markets and even foreign geopolitical events, said Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli, fixed-income strategists at BMO Capital Markets, in a Tuesday research note.\n\nTreasury yields have steadily inched lower over the past four weeks, retracing part of a steep postelection climb triggered by Trump's unexpected electoral victory.\n\nInvestors pushed yields higher on the expectation that Trump's proposed policiesâ€”including stiffer trade barriers, a massive infrastructure bill and deregulationâ€”would boost growth and wages, causing consumer-price inflation to rise more aggressively.\n\nTypically, when inflation is on the rise, bond investors demand higher yields to compensate for the corrosive affect that higher prices have on real returns.\n\nInvestors will soon turn their attention to a report on consumer-price inflation, due on Wednesday, remarks from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, and Trump's Friday inauguration.\n\nFed. Gov. Lael Brainard said on Tuesday that the central bank might need to raise interest rates more swiftly if Trump's fiscal policies are too focused on stoking short-term demand. Yields remained lower after her comments.\n\nMeanwhile, government-bond yields held steady after the Empire State manufacturing index declined in January, retreating from an eight-month high.
'if inflation picks up, or even if it doesn't, and more companies decide to diversify some small portion of their cash balances into bitcoin instead of cash, then the current relative trickle into bitcoin would become a torrent.'  â€” bill miller\n\nthat's bill miller, founder of miller value partners, in a letter to clients published on the firm's website tuesday, reaffirming his bullish outlook on the world's most popular digital currency.\n\nmiller is one of several high-profile wall street investors, including stanley druckenmiller and paul tudor jones, to have embraced bitcoin. part of the enthusiasm comes from the increased adoption of digital currencies, including the announcement by paypal holdings inc. pypl, +0.87% last year that it would allow customers to buy cryptocurrency through their accounts and use cryptocurrency for merchant payments.
1. Changes in social security laws, to repeal the file-and-suspend strategy which was used by married couples, occurred late in 2015. This presents some married couples, just entering retirement years, an opportunity to grandfather under the old rules. But this opportunity is only available for a few more months.\n\n2. Interest rate rises are likely to be modest, but will still affect bond returns. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds fall. The longer the duration of the bond, the more likely its fall in price. Since fixed income investments are a defensive part of a portfolio, designed in part to offer some stability to the overall value of the portfolio, retirees might consider instituting a ladder of CDs, purchased directly from banks (and keeping within FDIC limits). Most CDs over 1 year in maturity can be redeemed early with a 180-day interest penalty; if interest rates rise significantly, retirees can exercise this put, in essence, when it makes sense to incur the penalty to reap the higher interest rates for the remainder of the original CD term. A short-term bond fund may be added to the fixed income part of the portfolio, to provide some liquidity. Never forget the threat of inflation; while inflation has been low over the past decade, in particular, it could come roaring back at any time; a ladder of inflation-protected securities held in a tax-deferred (401(k) or IRA) account, or a bond fund containing TIPS, might be a prudent part of a person's fixed income portfolio, to help guard against inflation risk.\n\n3. Markets will remain volatile, as investors are still wary of adverse economic developments and often overreact to same. It's best to have an investment policy that specifies, in advance, what will occur if the stock, bond, real estate or commodities markets (or any other asset class the investor possesses) goes up or down significantly in value. This disciplined approach to rebalancing an investment portfolio pays off.\n\n4. Growth stocks are much more significantly overvalued at present, relative to value stocks. And large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks over about the last five years, as well. Given this, a long-term allocation of part of an investment portfolio to U.S. small cap value stocks makes sense. Emerging markets stocks are another area that appears to have lower values, relative to other stocks. While volatile, an allocation to emerging markets stocks for a small part of an investment portfolio could significantly add to returns over the long term (10 years or more), provided rebalancing of the portfolio occurs periodically.\n\n5. Equity indexed annuities continue to be marketed as a stock market alternative, when in fact they are an alternative to fixed income investments. Be cautious with these products; insurance company financial strength is very important when purchasing a fixed, or equity indexed, annuity. Additionally, many of these EIAs possess high sales charges, and high surrender fees.\n\n6. On the regulatory front, the U.S. Department of Labor is close to finalizing regulations that will require all those providing advice to 401(k), certain other ERISA-covered retirement plan accounts, and all forms of IRAs, to do so under the fiduciary standard. But, the implementation date is likely to be at the end of 2016, not before. And the regulations won't apply to other types of accounts (such as individual non-IRA accounts, joint accounts, and trust accounts). Hence, investors need to protect themselves:\n\nWork with a fee-only adviser, to ensure conflicts of interest are minimized. (See #7 below, on how to find one.)\n\nHave your adviser sign the fiduciary oath. (See #8 below for more).\n\nThere are many costly products (see #9 below) to avoid: i. Variable annuities which possess deferred contingent sales charges; ii.Equity indexed annuities marketed as alternatives to stock market investing, or any that possess a deferred contingent sales charge; iii.Non-publicly traded REITs; iv.Hedge funds; v.Proprietary mutual funds (mutual funds manufactured by an affiliate of your brokerage firm); vi.Principal trades (such as when a brokerage firm sells you a bond out of their inventory); vii.IPOs (on average, the performance of stocks in IPOs underperforms the rest of the market over the two years following the IPO (initial public offering)â€”there will always be some big winners, but the losers (underperformers) dominate in this space; viii.Any cash value life insurance product sold for retirement needs.\n\n7.The best advice I can give is to work with a financial adviser who has chosen to avoid most conflicts of interest, by being fee-only. The best way to find such advisers is through organizations of fee-only advisers:\n\nNational Association of Personal Financial Advisors (www.napfa.org);\n\nGarrett Planning Network (www.garrettplanningnetwork.com);\n\nAlliance of Comprehensive Planners (www.acplanners.org); and\n\nXY Planning Network (www.xyplanningnetwork.com).\n\n8. Without a doubt, all retirees who choose to work with a financial planner should have their planner sign the Fiduciary Oath suggested by The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, located here. If you have a current adviser, and that adviser won't sign the fiduciary oath within a reasonable time after being asked, that's a strong warning sign that the consumer should seek a second opinion from a fee-only financial planner/investment adviser.\n\n9. About 90% of investment products have fees and costs which are too high. The academic research in this area, stretching back for decades now, is compellingâ€”higher fees are almost certainly going to lead to lower returns over the long run. Consider a racehorse in the Kentucky Derby. All of the horses racing must carry the same weightâ€”jockey, tack, and (when necessary to equalize things out) some small weights in the saddlebag. If a horse carries more weight (similar, for example, to investments with higher fees), the horse still might manage some smart strategy and win a short race, but for longer races the extra weight is definitely going to slow that horse down. By far the largest single factor affecting investor returns in mutual funds, variable annuities, ETFs and other pooled investment vehicles are the fees and costs incurred. Low-cost products will highly likely possess higher returns over the long run, and just a small difference in returns can add up over a long retirement.\n\n10. Other than keeping fees (and there are many hidden fees in investment products) and costs low, the next most important decision relates to strategic asset allocationâ€”i.e., what is the target allocation to various asset classes (U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, fixed income investments, etc.) over the long term. Many retirees have investment portfolios that are either too aggressive or too conservative. And most risk tolerance questionnaires lack true insight into how much investment risk you NEED to take on, as opposed to how much risk you can tolerate. Developing a strategic asset allocation, as part of an overall investment policy, is an area that a fee-only, expert financial planner/investment adviser can help a retiree with.\n\n11. Financial advisers can add value, but only if they are experts and have very high ethical standards. Look for advisers who possess a Certified Financial Planner certification (73,000+ in the U.S. now), as a baseline indication of competency. The CPA/PFS (personal financial specialist), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and Chartered Financial Consultant designations are also worthwhile. Most of the other 200 or more designations don't pass muster.\n\n12. I urge retirees to use caution when purchasing fixed annuities, and another newer type of (fixed) annuityâ€”the longevity annuity. If interest rates do, in fact, increase, then better annuitization rates will likely appear, resulting in greater payouts from the annuities. While fixed annuities have a place to play for some retirees, purchasing one should likely be done with the aid of a fee-only adviser who possesses expertise in evaluating the strength of the life insurance company, the vitality of the state insurance guarantee fund which might be available in case of insurance company default, whether to structure the annuity with a CPI (inflation) rider or equivalent, whether to ladder fixed annuities over time, and to secure the better rates through shopping for no-load or low-load annuities.\n\n13. Longevity continues to increase. Don't plan for average life expectanciesâ€”consider the possibility that your life expectancy might be longer than average. I tell most of my clients that we are going to plan for them to live to age 100, and that we will manage the portfolio on that basis. I don't want my clients to run out of money at age 90, or 95!\n\n14. Have a fee-only financial planner undertake a comprehensive review of all of your various types of insuranceâ€”home, auto, umbrella, life, health (including Medicare Part C or D, Medigap), long-term care, etc. Most retirees tend to have too much for some types of insurance, and too little for other typesâ€”or, by not shopping around every couple of years, they are paying far too much relative to other, lower-cost policies.\n\n15. Take a home inventory. Take out that smartphone and photograph EVERYTHING in your house, garage, attic, etc. Open up drawers. Take photos of closet contents. Take close-ups. Then save all of these photos to a flash drive, and put the flash drive in a safe-deposit box (or have a relative who resides somewhere else) hold it. In the event of fire, flood or other natural disaster, having such pictures really helps to secure a greater settlement with the insurance company over personal property items.\n\n16. Plan for 2025. That's about the time we should have self-driving cars. And, as you get older, time proceeds faster (in your perception), which slows your reaction times. These and other factors tend to make driving skills decline over time. With self-driving cars will come far fewer accidents, and car ownership will change. More and more people will have shared cars (just call up a car, using an app), which should cut the cost of car ownership and use dramatically. And, it will aid many older retirees to maintain mobility. So, if you plan to purchase a car anytime soon, plan to keep it for 10 years, and realize that this might be the last car you purchase in your lifetime, as you will rent self-driving cars in the future.\n\n17. Lastly, know what your bucket list is all about, and have a road map for attaining it. To formulate a bucket list, have your financial adviser ask you this question: If your doctor told you that you had only 5-6 years to live, and during that time you'll be as healthy as your are now, what would you want to do or accomplish so that, at the end of your life, you had no regrets?
Last year didn't just bring change. It brought a seismic schism that will permanently alter how we work and live. What began as a public health crisis â€” one that will continue into the new year â€” became an unprecedented series of different crises that also took both jobs and the stock market on a roller-coaster ride.\n\nAs we head into 2021, it's time to look ahead for how we can take what we've learned from the past 12 months â€” and further back â€” and sort out the trends that will be most advantageous.\n\nRead: Yes, it's possible to save too much for retirement\n\nPart Great Recession, part great reinvention\n\nLike the last financial crisis of 2008-2010, this year economic volatility drove people to focus on high quality assets and liquidity while taking on less risk. But over the course of the pandemic, we started to see job losses stabilize, at least compared with a decade ago, and stocks bounced back and even surged.\n\nThis allowed for many to shift from being focused on their next paycheck to insuring against adverse events impacting their own health. In fact, we saw a notable difference in the purchase of health protection products compared with a decade ago.\n\nLooking into 2021 and beyond, regardless of age, health or status, more Americans are acknowledging their own mortality and the importance of protecting their loved ones.\n\nRead: How to get a job in 2021 if you're over 50\n\nThe three most important words in finance are 'digital, digital, digital'\n\nThe 'need for immediacy' was becoming a cornerstone of the financial world before the pandemic, but in 2020 we experienced a decade's worth of digital transformation in just six months. The industry's focus on digital innovation is particularly critical as millennials and Generation Z increase their share of the personal finance marketplace. In fact, our recent consumer poll showed that more than half of these groups would prefer to make purchase decisions through digital experiences using virtual or augmented reality technology.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2021 and beyond, the digital experience for all financial offerings must catch up to comparable industries as everyone expects compelling products, seamless engagement and access to a broad shelf of offerings how and when they want them.\n\nOne crisis detoured â€” student loan debt\n\nEntering 2020, employers and policy makers were focused on supporting college grads by figuring out ways to help reduce their college debts. To wit, we released of a survey in December 2019 which found that 35% of employers were concerned about their employees' student loan debt. However, the economic fallout of the pandemic combined with a new administration is poised to turn that world upside down.\n\nWhile we don't know the full extent to which loan repayment policies will change, it's possible that everything from income-driven repayment to full on debt cancellation is in play. No matter the specific outcome, this new dynamic will allow for greater focus on emergency and long-term savings alongside retirement planning.\n\nRead: I can afford a $300,000 home in a ski town â€” where can I retire?\n\nA shift in trust\n\nWe entered 2020 on the brink of a trust crisis, as traditional institutions from mainstream media to the government became divisive sources and many flocked to social media circles to serve as their most relied upon source for financial guidance. In fact, during the prosperous decade that preceded 2020, the rise of crowdsourcing meant many of us not only used recommendations from strangers to decide where to eat or what movie to see, it also determined our biggest financial decisions.\n\nLooking ahead, the importance of trust has never been more critical, now ranking as the second most important factor in purchasing decisions. When it comes to your finances, we're seeing the bumpy social media ride of this past year push many toward quality, trusting expert advice over friend-turned-unfriended 'sources.'\n\nThis past year tested us all in ways we never could have predicted. But now that we all know what we're capable of, we can plan ahead and ensure we're more prepared for the obstacles facing us in 2021.\n\nAmanda Wallace is head of insurance operations with MassMutual, a life insurance provider.
The most important earnings season for tech since the dot-com boom went bust is about to begin, but don't expect a holiday miracle, especially for the companies that are used to a victory lap at this time of year.\n\nThe first round of quarterly earnings every year is normally an exuberant time for tech companies, which get to show off how many devices they put under Christmas trees, how many ads for those goodies they sold, or services that will be enjoyed on the new iPhones, PCs and more. This earnings season, though, comes in the wake of a huge fourth-quarter decline for tech stocks, as forecasts for the holiday season sparked concerns about the death of huge growth rates that have propelled tech companies to previously outsize valuations â€” the most serious challenge the current tech boom has faced.\n\nThe one bright spot from the bloodletting at the end of 2018 is that expectations have been diminished, leading Wall Street to expect slower revenue and earnings growth. With much more subdued results now expected for many tech companies, strong growth is likely to be rewarded and slowing growth may not be punished as harshly as it was late last year. As was the case last quarter, all companies will likely be judged more on their outlook than their past results, as investors try to get a handle on where the tech boom will go from here.\n\nFor more: You should be worried about tech stocks, and here's why\n\nIn general, financial analysts expect a mixed bag from tech this quarter that goes against what we would expect from the holiday season. The biggest growth is expected from companies focused on the corporate sector and internet advertising, while consumer-focused hardware could drag the overall results down. Those expectations show investors must break tech into different sectors, instead of trying to view it as a monolith that moves as one.\n\nUnfortunately, people lump tech all in one group, they say tech is good or bad, said Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta.\n\nThe S&P 500 index helped in this regard last year by splitting some large tech companies away from the sector largely referred to as tech, to show the differences between the companies. The interactive media sector â€” which was created last year and comprises Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.26% GOOGL, +1.43% , Facebook Inc. FB, +2.02% , Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.47% and TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, -3.66% â€” saw revenue soar 25.8% and earnings surge 42% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Wall Street still expects massive sales growth to continue in fourth-quarter results this year, with revenue expected to increase 46.4%, but earnings are only expected to grow 8.5%, dragged down by Facebook's hefty spending on combating issues of data privacy, security and breaches.\n\nIn 2017, companies that make up the S&P 500 index's IT services sector, the bulk of tech companies, saw revenue growth of 11.5% and profit growth of 22% in the fourth quarter. This year, the Street expects single-digit revenue growth of about 5.4% from the IT group, and 8% earnings growth, according to FactSet.\n\nTo me, the consumer is kind of tired out, said Morgan, adding that he is looking for better results from companies focused on selling tech to businesses, especially in cloud computing. He is expecting double-digit growth of about 10% in enterprise software overall, and cloud computing to grow about 22%, versus semiconductors, which are probably looking at a negative growth rate. He pointed out that at the tail end of earnings last quarter, Salesforce.com CRM, +0.79% , Workday Inc. WDAY, +0.88% and even Hewlett Packard Enterprise Inc. HPE, -1.93% had strong results and guidance.\n\nThe most prominent consumer tech company, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% , already signaled that it will not boost revenue growth with its huge earnings warning earlier this month, when Apple said it expects a massive revenue shortfall of billions of dollars in its normally robust December quarter. Apple cited a big slowdown in China for the iPhone's slowing demand, due in part to the continuing trade war between the U.S. and China. It's also highly likely that Apple's high-end pricing model has hit a limit in China, where the average annual income was around $11,000 in 2017.\n\nMore from Therese: Apple lives up to Wall Street's fears with massive revenue shortfall\n\nApple's travails also included an admission that in some developed markets, iPhone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be. With fewer carrier subsidies, consumers are not as willing to pay full price for a smartphone that now starts at $749 for the lowest-end iPhone XR.\n\nOther data shows that the PC market saw unit sales fall 4.3% in the fourth quarter, largely due to a chip shortage from Intel Corp. INTC, +1.55% , which had ramifications throughout the industry. PC makers also had pent-up demand for some systems. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology Inc. MU, +2.90% said in mid-December that its customers were building up too much inventory of memory chips.\n\nSemiconductor stocks in general have officially entered downturn territory, said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, in a note late last week. Many chip companies are seeing revenue slow, some of it due to tariffs on Chinese goods, or due to uncertainty because of the tariffs and the malaise in the global economy. This quarter, outlook will again be key for insight as to whether the current downturn will be swift or slow, but Rasgon said investors are now nervous that more cuts to estimates and spending loom ahead.\n\nBut with further pockets of weakness potentially emerging, Apple's significant preannouncement, the potential remaining for further external/geopolitical shocks (China trade/tariffs/'policy-by-tweet' etc.) to impact demand, we shall see, Rasgon said. Thus, sector controversies have shifted to magnitude/duration, with worries over further cuts to come.\n\nTexas Instruments Inc. TXN, +1.27% was an early chip maker to call out the downturn and investors hope for more insights on overall demand trends when the company reports Jan. 23. TI has a big customer base in the automotive and industrial sectors. The other highly anticipated chip earnings will be coming from Intel, after a report by Bloomberg that the chip giant may try to name a new CEO to replace Brian Krzanich before it reports on Jan. 24, after more than six months with Robert Swan, its CFO, at the helm as an interim boss.\n\nOpinion: The chip slowdown is real, but how bad will it be?\n\nOther chip makers worth paying close attention to include Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.30% , which reports Jan. 23, and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.76% . AMD and Nvidia are hoping to gain some share from Intel in the corporate data center as a way to help fuel more growth, and investors will be waiting for more data. Nvidia was hit by a big drop in cryptocurrency mining that overloaded its sales channel last quarter, and suffered more jitters in December about a shortfall in its graphics processing units.\n\nThe likely bright spot in the quarter is expected to again be cloud computing, with strong results at Azure and AWS helping power Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.24% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.33% , respectively.\n\nThis earnings season is likely going to be a bit of a reversal from the normal holiday-sales results, where consumer buying helped fuel a big finish to the year. This time, the cloud may take that starring role away, and the consumer companies that failed to draw in consumers are in danger of even more punishment on Wall Street.
The Democrats appear set to enjoy majority control of both houses of Congress, handing President-elect Joe Biden power to enact policies that will favor certain industries.\n\nBased on Biden's comments, we can expect more stimulus spending by the federal government â€” possibly a lot more, which means an increase in the Federal Reserve's purchases of U.S. Treasury notes. That could very well mean another plunge in long-term interest rates and a continued flow of new money into the stock market.\n\nBut what about more particular policy points? If you look at stock market action Jan. 6, it is clear that investors expect Biden and Congress to do a lot for companies producing clean energy, or developing technology and services to enable other companies to do so.\n\nShares of clean-energy ETFs soared on Jan. 6.\n\nClean-energy ETFs are an easy way to play a long-term trend that is being pushed by governments around the world, with diversified portfolios. There are many of them, with different areas of focus and varying expenses.\n\nRead: 5 high-growth themes and the stock-market ETFs that can deliver big gains in 2021\n\nBut what about individual stocks?

But this argument assumes all workers have experienced the same increase in life expectancyâ€”without factoring in socioeconomic status. Does a Uniform Retirement Age Make Sense?, just released by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, examines data on mortality and income. The brief finds that life expectancies for low socioeconomic status individuals have been improving more slowly than for individuals in a higher socioeconomic bracket in recent decades, causing the life expectancy gap to grow.

The measure addresses each of the five issues in bills previously introduced to Congress by lawmakers, including controlled group rules, grandfathered defined benefit (DB) plans, automatic enrollment in church defined contribution (DC) plans, transfers between 403(b) and 401(a) plans, and investing in collective trusts.

Students set foot on a college campus often the hope that their education will help them climb the economic ladder and sustain themselves and their families.\n\nBut in many cases, they're going hungry in the process.\n\nNearly two million students may be walking around college campuses hungry and aren't getting access to the resources to which they're entitled.\n\nThat's one conclusion of a report published Wednesday by the Government Accountability Office, the first-ever federal government effort to understand the scope of food insecurity on college campuses and offer possible policy solutions.\n\nAmong low-income college students potentially eligible for food stamps who have at least one additional risk factor for food insecurity â€” including being a first-generation college student or a single parent â€” 57% did not report participating in the food stamp program in 2016, according to the GAO.\n\n The share of college students struggling to feed themselves adequately ranged from 9% to over 50%. \n\nThe report comes as higher education leaders and lawmakers are becoming increasingly aware of the challenges college students face meeting their basic needs, like having enough to eat, and how that can impact their ability to graduate college.\n\nOf 31 studies on campus-food insecurity reviewed by the GAO, the share of college students struggling to feed themselves adequately ranged from 9% to over 50%, with 22 of the studies estimating rates of food insecurity at more than 30%.\n\nAre you a college student struggling to afford food or housing? We want to hear from you. Email jberman@marketwatch.com\n\nAs colleges have started to better understand the nature of food insecurity on campus they've worked to respond. As of September 2018, more than 656 colleges have or were developing food pantries, according to data from the College and University Food Bank Alliance cited in the GAO study.\n\n The report suggests a national response that goes beyond what individual campuses can do. \n\nThe report suggests a national response that goes beyond what individual campuses can do. The authors recommend that Food and Nutrition Service, the division of the Department of Agriculture that oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the official name for the food stamp program, improve information on its website related to student eligibility.\n\nThe report also suggests FNS work more closely with SNAP agencies to make it easier for eligible college students to access food stamps. That includes sharing information about how some regions are already successfully working with local college students to make them aware of their eligibility for the food stamp program.\n\nSara Goldrick-Rab, a professor at Temple University who has studied and advocated around campus food insecurity for years, said she was heartened to see the report so forcefully advocate for an agency to work to address this problem.\n\nA policy response is a far cry from the current response, which is campus food pantries, said Goldrick-Rab. It means increasing the economic self-sufficiency of students so they eat every day rather then just giving them a couple of cans when they're in an emergency.\n\n 'A policy response is a far cry from the current response, which is campus food pantries.'  â€” Sara Goldrick-Rab, Temple University professor\n\nThe reasons why eligible students may be struggling to access SNAP are complex, but one major issue is the perception that college students don't qualify. In 1980, the federal government restricted college-student access to SNAP as a way to prevent traditional students â€” those attending full-time and receiving financial support from their parents â€” from qualifying for the program because of their low income while in school.\n\nBut as the GAO notes, there are a number of exceptions to this rule, including for college students who are caring for a young child, working a minimum of 20 hours per week and participating in a federally or state-backed work-study program.\n\nAt nine of the 14 colleges studied by the GAO, officials and students had difficulty fully understanding the rules around college student SNAP eligibility. At one school, officials said they believed college students weren't eligible for the program. Officials at three colleges said they would like information from FNS about college student eligibility for SNAP, but that targeted information isn't available.\n\n At nine of the 14 colleges studied by the GAO, officials and students had difficulty fully understanding the rules around college student SNAP eligibility. \n\nAlthough the GAO found that some state SNAP agencies are working to help college students better understand their eligibility, the lack of information surrounding the topic means eligible students are struggling to access these benefits. That's despite the many reasons we have to believe that students are walking around campuses hungry.\n\nFor one, more low-income students are coming to college than ever before, which means there's a larger pool of students likely to be food insecure. At the same time, college costs have risen dramatically over the past few decades, and the support the federal government offers to college students hasn't kept up â€” pushing students to scrounge for resources.\n\nOne college official interviewed by the GAO reported that, in the past, students at their institution had enough financial aid money left over after tuition to pay for rent and food, but now, because tuition is so high, students rarely get a refund after it's paid.\n\n 'It's the first time the federal government has recognized this problem really openly.'  â€” Sara Goldrick-Rab, Temple University professor\n\nIn addition to the information provided in the GAO report, its mere existence is important. It's the first time the federal government has recognized this problem really openly, Goldrick-Rab said of food insecurity on college campuses.\n\nAnd as the report notes, it makes sense for the government to acknowledge student hunger and its ability to undermine college completion â€” a goal the government invests hundreds of millions of dollars into each year.\n\nYou can't give somebody a scholarship, or financial aid, send them to college have them be hungry and expect them to do well, Goldrick-Rab said.
Investors are increasingly skeptical of President-elect Donald Trump's plans to enact pro-growth economic policies, according to a proprietary gauge of investor sentiment compiled by Citigroup Inc.\n\nThe News Implied Sentiment Indicator, or NISI, has reversed most of its postelection rise, as the chart from the Citigroup team of macro analysts illustrates:\n\nBloomberg and Citigroup Research\n\nThe index aims to capture investor sentiment by measuring the number of Bloomberg News stories containing the keywords bullish and bearish. The index is correlated to risk assets, as well as Citigroup's Global Risk Aversion Macro Index, or GRAMI, the analysts said. Occasionally, turning points in the NISI precipitate moves corresponding moves in stocks, they said.\n\nRead: Investors are bracing for a massive stock-market selloff\n\nAlso read:Trump sends shivers through stock market on 'too strong' dollar comments\n\nThe expectation that Trump would be able to follow through on promises to roll out a massive infrastructure-spending bill, cut corporate taxes, and repeal a broad swath of back of Wall Street regulations, likely helped spark the rally, the strategists said.\n\nHowever, the index has swung back to neutral in the opening weeks of 2017. This suggest that the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% could retreat to around 2,200 in the near term, the strategists said. It's presently trading at 2,266.\n\nIs some of the optimism fuelled by Trump fading perhaps?, The Citigroup analysts said. For what it's worth, prediction markets are pricing in a 50% probability that Trumpâ€Ž won't finish out the term in office.\n\nAccording to recent polls, Trump's approval ratings have fallen since the election. Surveys from CNN/ORC and ABC News/Washington Post released on Tuesday showed a majority of Americans harbor an unfavorable view of the president-elect, Politico reported. Trump will be sworn in to office on Friday.\n\nIn the market, several popular Trump trades have reversed or stalled in recent weeks. Gold prices GLD, -0.58% have risen about 8% from their postelection lows, the dollar DXY, +0.41% is about 3% softer and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has retreated after coming within a hair's breadth of the 20,000 milestone.\n\nTrump rattled markets on Tuesday after he said a congressional Republican proposal for a border-tax adjustment was too complicated. He also said he believes more countries will leave the European Union in the coming years, and that the one-China policy, which counts Taiwan as an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China, is up for negotiation. His comments were published by The Wall Street Journal over the weekend.
Dear Moneyist,\n\nMy husband and I grew up dirt poor â€” I mean he literally had holes in the floor where you could see the dirt. I was fairly better off, my single mother had been expected to marry and have no need for understanding how things like credit worked (her father was a loan officer; it was a different time). At times, we had a little money and, at other times, we ate at the local churches.\n\n 'Our only assets are in a sock drawer.' \n\nAs a result, my husband and I suffer the same affliction. We were given occasionally some pocket change to buy treats, candy, chips, sodas, etc. This is the only time money would cross our fingertips, and it would be gone within minutes to an hour. Bottom line â€” we only know how to spend and not how to save. We only live for the moment when it comes to finances.\n\n'This has become a serious problem.'\n\nâ€¢ We are coming up on our 10th wedding anniversary.\n\nâ€¢ We have an 11-year-old son.\n\nâ€¢ Between us we have 3 teenage children from previous relationships that do not live with us.\n\nâ€¢ We live in Texas.\n\nâ€¢ We have no life insurance or savings, and we rent the condo we live in.\n\nâ€¢ Our only assets are in a sock drawer.\n\nAlso see:My husband is unemployed â€” we are shamefaced tipping our doormen a pittance\n\nMy husband doesn't believe in credit (it's all made up numbers). He also doesn't believe that we can afford life insurance â€” even though we dine out several times a week. My husband doesn't have a bank account and the man owns a sub-contracting company. (Literally, he cashes checks in a strip mall for outrageous fees, and who knows where that money goes.)\n\n 'We apparently don't believe in health insurance either.' \n\nAbout 2.5 years ago we bought a property in the woods near a lake, set a small cabin on it, and this is where my husband wishes to retire. It's valued at $38,000, we owe $29,000. We live in a vacation destination city and in 5 or 10 years, we won't be able to afford to any more. We have racked up $10,000 in credit-card debt after my husband suffered a fall and broken bones last year.\n\nDon't miss:I earn $15 an hour and will inherit $150,000 â€” how do I secure my future?\n\nWe apparently don't believe in health insurance either. We are both in poor health, we pay cash for our son's dental and doctor visits, and because I'm a satisfactory degree of Native American descent, my son and I can run up to Oklahoma for major health needs for free if needs be. I did have to go to the ER last year. I pay $30 per month toward that bill, there's no interest on the account so I can take my time paying it off. My husband does not pay his medical debt.\n\n'My situation is a little different'\n\nI was pre-law in college. I've always believed in educating oneself to the fullest extent possible no matter your life's situation â€” and so I've been reading your letters for years and researching ways to improve my situation for months.\n\nâ€¢ I do believe in saving a little money even if you don't make very much. (And I have about $400 saved in a money-market account I opened 2 months ago. Believe me, this is a big deal.)\n\nâ€¢ I do believe that the poorest people need life insurance the most. (Ever watch A Tree Grows in Brooklyn? That mother paid the life insurance man before she put food on the table!)\n\nâ€¢ I also believe in investing what little you have, even if it's a small amount of money you were going to spend at the Chili's Restaurant. I have a Betterment account being used as an additional savings vehicle because over the course of many years, certain bonds and funds tend to be a safe place to keep money, and occasionally grow it by a couple of percent, which is a little better than the money market account.\n\nSee:I received $500 from an insurer for damage to my car â€” can I spend it on me?\n\nI also have a Robinhood account where I have deposited a minuscule amount of money for investment testing, which I will only be doing after massive amounts of research on the TD Ameritrade platforms on the account. I'm not going for day trading or swing trading, just looking for possible safe-ish opportunities with minimal risk patterns and possible small growth.\n\n'Here is how I approach our finances'\n\nâ€¢ I don't believe in giving children money to buy themselves something you would buy them. (If I want my son to have an ice cream I buy him one. If I hand him dollars they go in the bank I've set up for him at home complete with a check register. We've been doing this for 4 years. Occasionally, he will spend money on a big ticket item. Recently, he bought a $30 book.) I don't believe in 'disposable income.\n\nâ€¢ My company is starting a 401(k) program with Mass Mutual with a 25% match. (It's not a lot, but free money is free money. Sadly, as the beneficiary I think my husband would have to sign for it.)\n\nâ€¢ $7,000 of that credit-card debt we racked up is on my credit cards â€” and I only make $12 per hour.\n\nâ€¢ My husband always said no to savings and investment â€” so he is unaware of any accounts mentioned.\n\nâ€¢ Like I said, we are in poor health and need life insurance if anything, but that's not something I can get for him on my own. Our youngest child is only 11.\n\n 'My husband always said no to savings and investment.' \n\nDo I enroll in the 401(k) or do I wait until I get the credit-card debt paid down? Can I get a life insurance policy on my husband without his permission? Even maybe final expense? (Oh, I have an AD&D policy for $50,000 for me and $25,000 for my spouse or child, with my sister as the beneficiary. It costs me $10 per month.\n\nYou see what I mean about affordability? She is also the trusted contact for every other account, because she understands I'm trying to protect just a little of our money from the wasted dollars we spend every month. )\n\nI know any earnings I could see on investment is nothing compared to credit-card interest, which I have been charged with paying off all by myself.\n\nBasically, I don't have a plan. And I need one. Help. Thank you.\n\nSecret Saver\n\nDear Saver,\n\nYour case is a classic, the classic, example of why you should discuss your approach to finances before you get married. It doesn't just impact your happiness, it has multiple effects on your peace of mind, your children's future, their education, your ability to retire early or at all, insurance against the kind of health emergency that can bankrupt families and cost them their home.\n\nRecommended:Should I spend my daughter's $100,000 trust fund on private schools and ballet classes?\n\nOut-of-pocket health costs for elderly Americans aged 65 and over who use Medicare ate up approximately 41% of the average Social Security income in 2013, according to nonprofit organization Kaiser Family Foundation. It expects such costs will soar to 50% of the average social security income by 2030. We are all temporarily abled. As we age, that changes. You need a plan.\n\n 'Making minimum payments on your credit card is a long road to nowhere.' \n\nKeep contributing to your 401(k) plan. Your husband does not have to sign as a beneficiary. You don't even have to name your husband as a beneficiary. You husband may be beyond hope, but explain to him that for someone who doesn't believe in debt, he shouldn't have racked up $7,000 on your credit card. This should be your No. 1 priority. The interest will continue to pile up.\n\nAllow me to put your credit-card debt into perspective. A $7,000 credit balance with an 18% annual rate, with a minimum payment of 2% of the balance, or $10, whichever is greater, would take 188 months or just nearly 16 years to pay off. Making minimum payments on your credit card is a long road to nowhere, and making no payments will lead to debt collectors and more stress.\n\nYou could sit down with your husband to explain how you would like to plan for the future. I don't know what kind of childhood or upbringing he had that has made him so distrustful of institutions, but he needs to see the consequences of his actions in black and white. If that fails, go ahead and keep making your own plans and never allow him to make purchases on your credit card again.\n\n 'Keep instilling your financial values in your children.' \n\nAnother tip from a financial adviser. Tristan Harding, director of insurance at PNC Wealth Management, asks you to discuss your health issues with a trusted professional and consider life insurance. The life insurance benefit would be able to pay off your credit-card debt and be used as income replacement for your husband's income at least until your son is no longer a dependent.\n\nKeep instilling your financial values in your children. More than one-fifth of American teens lack basic financial literacy skills. China had the most financially literate teens in the world, when evaluating 15-year-old students' knowledge in science, reading and mathematics across 15 countries. The U.S. ranked No. 7. Teaching your children to work for what they have is invaluable.\n\nThe current administration is rolling back Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act that would help people with low incomes and pre-existing health conditions.

But living paycheck-to-paycheck is not the answer. Somehow, with the help of family, you have to help him see that.\n\nThe difficult news: There may come a point where your love for your husband and your need to secure your future become mutually exclusive choices. I believe you have the willingness and obviously the intelligence to build a financial future for you and your children. When you have done everything that you believe can be done, that is a decision you may have to make.\n\nTwo more things: Good luck. Stay in touch.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

WASHINGTON--Jennifer Powell chartered a bus in Richmond, Virginia, filled it with 40 teachers and rode nearly two hours to Washington -- quite an effort to learn more about the U.S. economy.\n\nBut when you're learning from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, it's a ride worth taking, the Armstrong High School personal finance and economics teacher believes.\n\nWe're dealing with lower socioeconomic students, and it's hard for them to understand all of the big words about economics, Powell said. I don't want them to fall back on not having the money and knowledge they need to succeed.\n\nIn a short speech, Yellen schooled teachers on the history and primary functions of the Federal Reserve, and said that economic growth starts with education. She did not mention interest rates or the economic outlook for 2017.\n\nIt's important for people to understand when we adjust interest rates we're not trying to advance one group of savers or borrowers or another, Yellen said. What we're trying to do is keep the economy strong.\n\nTeacher Michelle Emond Nona Tepper/Medill News Service\n\nAfter her speech, the audience of about 60 educators at the Federal Reserve headquarters and remotely asked Yellen questions on topics ranging from President-elect Donald Trump's promise to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act to the underrepresentation of women in economics.\n\nA lot of people were critical of Dodd-Frank. Community bankers feel the burden of regulation is very great. I really feel strongly that we should be looking for ways to mitigate the regulatory burden, particularly for smaller institutions, Yellen responded.\n\nBut, she said, I certainly wouldn't want to see [Congress] roll it back.\n\nYellen also said she'd like more women to become economists.\n\nNationwide, about 30% of economics majors in college are women, she said, suggesting a lack of role models as well as an implicit bias as reasons for women's apparent disinterest in the field. She said research shows women economists receive less credit than men for co-authoring academic papers, especially when the co-author is a man.\n\nIt's something that I do hope will change over time, and may even make a difference in how public policy is conducted, she said.\n\nYellen is the first woman to head the nation's central financial institution, and attendee Michelle Emond views the Fed chair as a celebrity and positive role model for women.\n\nThe 29-year-old teacher rode the metro a hour from Queen Anne's County High School in Maryland to hear Yellen talk about how Federal Reserve decisions affect individuals.\n\nWhenever there's an opportunity to be the student, I try to take advantage, Emond said.
Much of the thesis surrounding a strong euro and a strengthening Japanese yen in 2018 is built around central banks and expectations for monetary-policy normalization across the globe. This week will put this idea to the test, as both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan hold their first meetings of the year.\n\nAnalysts expect the ECB to pull back on its easy-money policies this year to play catch-up with the Federal Reserve, which has already increased interest rates five times since 2015. A hawkish ECB might provide a further fillip to the euro EURUSD, -0.03% in 2018.\n\nThe Bank of Japan, meanwhile, is thought of as having the most accommodative monetary policy among its peers. Still, a decision to reduce its purchases of government bonds, also known as JGBs, earlier this month and comments about the negative effects of prolonged quantitative easing late last year, have analysts wondering when the BOJ will take action and push the yen USDJPY, -0.01% higher.\n\nBoth the BOJ on Tuesday and the ECB on Thursday are likely to hold their monetary policies unchanged, but the yen and the euro could move sharply nonetheless in the event of verbal intervention from either central bank, said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at Forex.com.\n\nThe BOJ's policy decision is due Jan. 23, followed by the ECB on Jan. 25.\n\nThe BOJ'statement will also be accompanied by the central bank's outlook report, which is the last one for Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda's current term, said analysts from BNP Paribas, including Michael Sneyd. Kuroda could be reappointed for a second term.\n\nA weaker yen would make sense given government bond yields of other developed nations are rising, the analysts added. Still, we would highlight that the yen remains very cheap from a long-term valuation perspective and [currency] markets continue to price in BOJ policy remaining very dovish for the foreseeable future. In that respect, there is risk that, if Mr. Kuroda's comments are seen as signaling a less dovish trajectory ahead, the yen could strengthen.\n\nEarlier this month, the BOJ opted to reduce the amount of government paper it buys through its quantitative-easing program, which made both the yen and yields on JGBs jump.\n\nRead: Relax, the Bank of Japan isn't taperingâ€”yet!\n\nIt jolted the markets earlier this month, particularly since the general consensus had been that the BOJ was in [easy-money mode] for the long haul, wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets U.K. This month's actions have shown that can't be taken for granted, so markets will be paying close attention to not only what Kuroda does, but also how [he] guides future expectations of policy moves later on into 2018.\n\nBack in Europe, expectations for the ECB to change its tone to a becoming more hawkish have mounted recently since the central bank released the minutes of its December meeting.\n\nAs per the minutes, policy makers think they could revisit their policy stances early this yearâ€”which could already mean this weekâ€”despite their continued concerns about low inflation, and occasional discomfort over a strengthening euro.\n\nThe ECB began to scale back the size of its monthly bond purchases to â‚¬30 billion ($36.7 billion) a month starting this month from the current pace of â‚¬60 billion, to be continued until at least September.\n\nAfter the euphoria that followed the ECB's December minutes, propelling the euro higher, traders could be disappointed should the central bank's boss Mario Draghi adopt a more dovish stance than anticipated this week, thereby leading to a euro slump.\n\nWe expect the ECB to wait until March before shifting policy, but Draghi's euro remarks will be scrutinized heavily, wrote BMO's European head of FX strategy Stephen Gallo.\n\nWe believe that market participants solely positioned for a tighter rate differential between the Federal Reserve and the ECB could become disillusioned with the euro in 2018, said Wells Fargo analysts including investment strategist Peter Donisanu.\n\nIf expectations have moved too much too fast, the euro could drop to $1.21, according to the BNP analysts. One euro last bought $1.2245 on Monday.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve's December meeting were the most hawkish in two years, according to an analysis from Prattle.\n\nUsing an algorithm, the firm analyzes the words and phrases in the minutes and gives a residual score indicating how it differs from the average tone of communication. The scores are normalized around zero and range between -2 and 2, with negative numbers indicating dovishness and positive numbers indicating hawkishness.\n\nThe minutes of the December meeting carried a fairly hawkish score of 0.54. That's more hawkish than the 0.27 score of the statement released after the meeting ended on Dec. 14. The scale is positive 2 to negative 2.\n\nIt definitely signals that the committee is increasingly concerned with upside risks that could cause the economy to overheat and necessitate a faster pace of rate hikes, said Evan Schnidman, CEO of Prattle.\n\nMinutes of the Dec. 13-14 meeting show the central bankers thought they might have to be more aggressive in raising interest rates than the gradual pace that they have been signaling.\n\nRead:Fed minutes show interest rates might come at faster pace\n\nThe minutes exhibited less confidence in this base case rate outlook than before, with more recognition of the upside risk to the rate path, said Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI.\n\nThe biggest risk to the outlook according to Fed officials was a continued drop in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate dropped to a nine-year low of 4.6% in November.\n\nThe spike down to a 4.6% unemployment rate seems to have sapped even the most diehard doves of any energy to continue concocting arguments to support the notion that significant labor market slack remains, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.\n\nSo, now the labor market discussion will move on to a) how far is the unemployment rate going to shoot past its long-run equilibrium and b) how quickly are wages accelerating, he said in a research note.\n\nWard McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, said that the Fed is waving a yellow flag that both economic activity and inflation may exceed policymaker expectations, especially if there is a boost from President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal plans.\n\nConsequently, policymakers foresee the possibility that rate hikes could exceed current Federal Open Market Committee expectations, and reinvestment policy for the balance sheet could be back on the table sooner than is generally expected due to upside risks, he said.\n\nThere was no universal agreement among Fed watchers about the message in the minutes.\n\nEconomists at Economy.com saw no sense of urgency in the minutes to raise interest rates again. They saw widespread uncertainty among Fed officials about the outlook.\n\nAnd Gus Faucher, deputy chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said the minutes make the case for a gradual pace of increases in the federal funds rate over the next few years.
Gold futures rose by nearly 3% on Monday to start the new year, after putting in the best annual return in a decade, with the move for bullion to its highest finish since November coming as the dollar sank to around a 2 1/2-year nadir.\n\nIn the short term, expect gold prices to rise because of the economic consequences of the recent aggressive rise of COVID infections, hospitalizations, and deaths as well as the new and apparently highly contagious strain of COVID, said Ed Moy, former director of the U.S. Mint and chief strategist at gold seller Valaurum.\n\nThis will likely result in significantly increased economic stimulus in the United States, both monetary and fiscal, which in turn will put downward pressure on the [U.S. dollar] and push gold prices higher, he said in emailed commentary.\n\nThe U.S. saw at least 201,476 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, and at least 1,353 people died, according to a New York Times tracker. In the last week, the U.S. has averaged 212,893 cases a day, down 1% from the average two weeks ago\n\nAgainst that backdrop, gold futures for February delivery GCG1 GC00, +1.14% advanced $51.50 to settle at $1,946.60 an ounce, a gain of 2.7%. Based on the most-active contract, prices scored their highest finish since Nov. 6, and their largest one-day percentage gain since April 22, according to FactSet data.\n\nSilver futures for March delivery SIH21, +2.14% SI00, +1.75% , meanwhile, rose 95 cents, or 3.6%, to finish at $27.364 an ounce.\n\nThe dollar was little changed as gold futures settled on Monday, but had traded as low as 89.423, around its lowest levels since April 2018, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.11% , a gauge of the buck against six major rivals.\n\nRead: U.S. dollar suffers its annual drop since 2017\n\nAn ongoing risk-rally means investors are continuing to swap their dollars for more risk sensitive currencies such as commodity dollars and emerging market currencies, said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with ThinkMarkets, in a note Monday. As a result, the dollar index has fallen to levels not seen since early 2018. This in turn, has helped to push prices of buck-denominated precious metals even higher.\n\nPrices for gold eased back a bit from Monday's highest levels after U.S. data revealed a rise in the Markit manufacturing PMI to 57.1 in December from 56.5, with the improvement in the reading helping to dull some haven demand for the precious metal. November construction spending, meanwhile, was up by a better than expected 0.9%.\n\nThe moves for gold and silver come after the commodities produced their best annual gains since 2010, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nGold rose around 0.5% last week, and 6.3% in December, and nearly 25% in 2020, with gains slowed to a mere 0.3% rise in the last three months of 2020.\n\nSilver futures logged a more than 2% climb last week, a 17% rise in December, and a roughly 48% annual advance last year, aided by an almost 13% surge in the fourth quarter.

After an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness on Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas sickened hundreds of passengers, the cruise line has offered travelers full refunds for the cost of the cruise fare.\n\nBut cruise passengers generally have very little recourse if they get sick during a vacation. It's difficult to prove the origins of food poisoning and any compensation is typically left to the generosity or goodwill of the cruise line in question.\n\nDon't miss:Why you shouldn't order ice on a flight, and other 'dirty little secrets'\n\nThe Oasis of the Seas returned to Port Canaveral, Fla. on Saturday, a day earlier than scheduled, after gastrointestinal illness sickened 277 guests and passengers since the ship departed on Jan. 6, Royal Caribbean told MarketWatch. That number reportedly grew to nearly 500 people since then.\n\nIn a somewhat unusual move, the cruise line has decided to provide travelers with full refunds of their paid cruise fares. The 7-night Western Caribbean voyage on the Oasis of the Seas starts at $626 per person before taxes and fees for an interior stateroom.\n\n 'This is just crazy. We're hunkered down in our room because I'm so scared of getting sick.'  â€” â€”Cruise Critic member Raycin\n\nIn addition to a full refund of the cruise fares, a letter allegedly delivered to the ship's passengers noted that the company will provide up to $200 per person for re-booked domestic flights, up to $400 per person for international flight change fees or up to $200 per stateroom for one night's stay at a hotel. Consumers need to contact Royal Caribbean to receive those reimbursements.\n\nThe company did not immediately confirm whether the letter was accurate.\n\nThe cruise line also said it will be refunding internet and beverage packages and prepaid gratuities on a prorated basis for the day the cruise won't be sailing.\n\nPassengers have noted in message boards on the travel site Cruise Critic that the ship's crew was taking extra precautions to prevent further spread of the illness, including extra cleaning of public areas and preventing passengers from serving themselves at the buffets.\n\nStill, some passengers have expressed frustration with the experience while the ship was still at sea. This is just crazy. We're hunkered down in our room because I'm so scared of getting sick, Cruise Critic member Raycin posted. This is our first cruise in 15 years and will most likely be our last.\n\nA spokesman for Royal Caribbean said the early return was designed, in part, to give the company more time to clean and sanitize the ship before its next sailing.\n\nWe think the right thing to do is to get everyone home early rather than have guests worry about their health, Owen Torres, corporate communications manager at Royal Caribbean, said in an email.\n\n Cruise lines are under no obligation to provide a refund.  â€” â€”Colleen McDaniel, executive editor at Cruise Critic\n\nOur guests sail with us to have great vacations, and we are sorry this cruise fell short, he added.\n\nIn recent years, outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness have become less common. Last year, there were only 11 confirmed outbreaks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which left only 658 people ill.\n\nOf those 11 outbreaks, only five were confirmed to be norovirus, one of viruses that most commonly causes gastroenteritis, which is the lowest figure in years.\n\nConsidering 28 million took a cruise in 2018, the number of those who reported ill was a tiny fraction of those who took a cruise, said Ben Souza, editor of travel website Cruise Fever.\n\nHere is what cruise passengers need to know about what they can do if they get sick on a cruise:\n\nDon't expect a refund â€” even if you get norovirus\n\nCruise lines are under no obligation to provide a refund, said Colleen McDaniel, executive editor at Cruise Critic. Typically, they will provide compensation in the form of cruise credits for future sailings or onboard credit for the remaining duration of the cruise.\n\nThe choice to offer a full refund was somewhat unusual on Royal Caribbean's part, as a result. Cruise lines look at this sort of thing on a case by case basis and how disruptive this was to passengers, McDaniel said. Given that Oasis of the Seas had to skip two ports of call and return a day early, McDaniel said it was abundantly clear to Royal Caribbean that the illness outbreak adversely affected passengers' experience even if they weren't sick.\n\n Last year, there were only 11 confirmed outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness, which left only 658 people ill. \n\nThe company would not confirm what it has offered in the case of previous gastrointestinal illness outbreaks. But Miami-based cruise-industry lawyer Jim Walker said that following a large outbreak on the Explorer of the Seas back in 2014, Royal Caribbean only offered a 50% refund on the cruise fare and a 50% credit toward a future cruise.\n\nIn most cases the cruise line will not offer any compensation, implying that it is the customers' fault for not washing their hands, even though the CDC and the FDA state that contaminated food or water are the most common explanations for norovirus, Walker said.\n\n In 2014, Royal Caribbean only offered a 50% refund on the cruise fare and a 50% credit toward a future cruise. \n\nArguing for more in compensation can also be something of a fool's errand. Walker said his law firm doesn't even take on cases involving these outbreaks. Don't call us if you get sick on a cruise, he said. Establishing where the virus came from, or that the cruise line was negligent, is virtually impossible to prove.\n\nAlso see: Running scared this flu season? 7 things you shouldn't touch â€” including soap\n\nConsumers' best avenue for compensation is through travel insurance\n\nMoreover, those who did fall ill while on board could be on the hook for the cost of any medical treatment they've received.\n\nIncidents like this illustrate why it's a good idea to consider buying travel insurance before you go, said Christine Sarkis, deputy executive editor of the travel site SmarterTravel.com.\n\nFor example, a travel-insurance policy with trip interruption coverage would help passengers defray the cost of returning home early. Other policies may also cover the expenses associated with medical treatment and an emergency evacuation from the ship if they are hospitalized while traveling.\n\nAdditionally, refunds like the one Royal Caribbean offered don't always cover additional travel expenses incurred, such as rebooking airfare.\n\nWhile on the ship, wash your hands\n\nPassengers' experience on the Oasis of the Seas is a strong reminder of the need to exercise good hygiene when traveling.\n\nWash your hands, McDaniel said. Wash them before you eat, and wash them after you use the restroom. That could help prevent the spread of illness, but may not be so helpful, however, if the contamination came from the kitchen.\n\nBuffets can be a hotbed of germs: If you see someone grab food from the buffet with their hands rather than a utensil, they should notify the ship crew to ensure that the potentially-tainted food is disposed.\n\nShares of Royal Caribbean RCL, -5.32% have dropped around 18.6% year-over-year. Comparatively, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% are both down roughly 8% during that same time period.\n\nThis story was updated on Jan. 15, 2019.
It is suddenly popular in the central banking community to suggest the Federal Reserve should adopt a new interest-rate approach, known as price-level targeting, especially after it was given the thumbs-up by none other than Ben Bernanke.\n\nOn Wednesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had advice for adherents of this new strategy: cool your jets.\n\nIn a speech to the CFA Society of St. Louis, Bullard said formal adoption of price-level targeting is not realistic in the near term.\n\nPrice-level targeting hasn't been tried by any major central bank, he noted.\n\nTherefore, it would require considerable study, before it could be implemented, he said.\n\nAt the moment, the Fed has a 2% inflation target. But inflation has been mostly below that level since 2012. This has led to soul searching among some policy-makers, and those who track their actions, for a new approach, Bullard noted.\n\nRead: Fed officials are already plotting how to combat the next downturn\n\nUnder the Fed's current targeting regime, the central bank doesn't do anything when inflation misses its target, simply uses the target to inform its discussion around policy.\n\nUnder price-level targeting, the Fed would commit to keeping the price level on a path defined by a 2% inflation rate, Bullard said. The hallmark of this approach is the Fed would commit to hitting the target over the medium term. The Fed would tolerate higher or lower inflation in the future to maintain the average inflation rate.\n\nOpinion: The Fed needs a better target, and then it needs to figure out how to hit it\n\nUsing 1995 as a baseline, Bullard estimated that it would take 10 years using price-level targeting to return inflation to a 2% inflation path.\n\nRead:Fed's Evans wanted to wait until middle of 2018 to see if rate hike was needed\n\nIt is because for the past five years in a row, the inflation target has been missed to the low side, and this has opened up a substantial gap between the actual and desired price level, Bullard said.\n\nBullard said the inflation-targeting approach has been successful in keeping inflation low and stable.
Asian equities started Thursday's session largely higher, building on start-of-the-year strength as U.S. stocks continued to gain overnight, though Japan equities retreated slightly after their stout kickoff to 2017.\n\nThe Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +1.01% was down 0.3% in recent trade after gaining 2.5% on Wednesday, while Korea's Kospi 180721, +0.61% was off 0.2%, but gains were logged in many other markets. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -0.73% was up 0.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.28% and Singapore's FTSE Strait Times Index STI, +0.90% both advanced 1%.\n\nDespite concerns of a depreciating Chinese yuan and more capital outflows in the region, a lot of the recent economic data have been pretty strong, notes Christoffer Moltke-Leth, director of global sales trading at Saxo Capital Markets,\n\nThe world is ticking along pretty healthily, he said.\n\nChina's December Caixin services purchasing managers' Index, a reading on the country's nonmanufacturing economy, rose to 53.4 from 53.1. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's PMI moved back into growth territory for the first time in nearly two years in December.\n\nBut despite Hong Kong's improvement, IHS Markit economist Bernard Aw said there are concerns growth in other key variables such as output and new orders remained elusive. He added, Chinese demand for Hong Kong's products and services continued to wane. Overall client appetite remained sluggish, as reflected by lower volumes of output and new business.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.51% was little changed.\n\nMeanwhile, the modest drop in Japanese stocks â€” which includes exporters like Canon Inc. 7751, +0.40% dropping 0.4% and Toyota Motor Co. 7203, +4.12% declining 0.8% â€” comes as the yen has rebounded 0.6% against the dollar, which was lower versus most Asian currencies early Thursday following overnight weakness in the greenback.\n\nThe currency was lower ahead of the overnight release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes after hitting fresh 14-year highs Tuesday. Gains have been fueled by the potential of repeated U.S. interest-rate hikes this year, but the minutes highlighted considerable uncertainty about what President-elect Donald Trump's administration may mean for policy and economic activity alike.
Medicare health insurance premiums can add up to big bucks, especially if you're married and both you and your spouse are paying. In this column, I'll list the 2018 and 2019 premium amounts and explain when you can potentially claim tax deductions for them. Here goes.\n\nMedicare Part A coverage is commonly called Medicare hospital insurance. It covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, and some home health care services. You don't have to pay premiums for Part A coverage if you paid Medicare taxes for 40 or more quarters during your working years. In that case, you're considered to have paid your Part A premiums via Medicare taxes on wages and/or self-employment income. However, some individuals did not pay Medicare taxes for enough months while working and must pay for Part A coverage.\n\n* If you paid Medicare taxes for 30-39 quarters during your working years, the 2018 Part A premium was $237 per month ($2,844 for the full year). For 2019, the monthly premium is $240 ($2,880 for the full year).\n\n* If you paid Medicare taxes for less than 30 quarters, the 2018 Part A premium was $422 per month ($5,064 for the full year). For 2019, the monthly premium is $437 ($5,244 for the full year).\n\n* The same premiums apply to your spouse if he or she paid Medicare taxes for less than 40 quarters while working.\n\nMedicare Part B Premiums\n\nMedicare Part B coverage is commonly called Medicare medical insurance or Original Medicare. Part B mainly covers doctors and outpatient services, and Medicare-eligible individuals must pay monthly premiums for this benefit.\n\nThe monthly premium for the current year depends on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), as reported on your Form 1040 for two years earlier. Strange but true. For example, your 2019 premiums depend on your 2017 MAGI. MAGI means the adjusted gross income (AGI) amount shown on page 1 of your Form 1040 plus any tax-exempt interest income.\n\nFor 2018, most people paid the base Part B premium of $134 per month ($1,608 if premiums were paid for the full year).\n\nFor 2019, the base premium is $135.60 per month ($1,627 for the full year).\n\nHigher-income individuals must pay a surcharge for Part B coverage on top of the base premium. See the section below.\n\nMedicare Part D Premiums\n\nMedicare Part D coverage is for private prescription drug coverage. Premiums vary depending on the plan. Higher-income individuals must pay a surcharge on top of the base premium. See the section near the bottom of this article.\n\nMedigap Supplemental Coverage Premiums\n\nMedicare Parts A and B do not pay for all health care expenses. Coverage gaps include copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. So you may want to buy a so-called Medigap policy, which is private supplemental insurance that's intended to cover some or all of the gaps. In most states, insurance companies can only sell standardized Medigap policies that offer the same basic benefits. Some Medigap policies offer additional benefits for an additional cost. Premiums vary depending on the plan you select.\n\nMedicare Advantage (Medicare Part C) Premiums\n\nYou can get your Medicare benefits from the government through Part A and Part B coverage or through a so-called Medicare Advantage plan offered by a private insurance company. Medicare Advantage plans are sometimes called Medicare Part C.\n\nThe government pays the Medicare Advantage insurance company to cover your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. Medicare Advantage plans may also include prescription drug coverage (Medicare Part D), and they may also provide dental and vision care benefits that are not covered by Medicare Part B.\n\nWhen you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you continue to pay Medicare Part B premiums. You will usually pay a separate additional monthly premium for the Medicare Advantage plan, but some plans do not charge any additional premium. The additional premium, if any, depends on the plan you select.\n\nKey Point: Medigap policies do not work with Medicare Advantage plans. So if you join a Medicare Advantage plan, you should drop your Medigap coverage.\n\nTax deductions for Medicare health insurance premiums\n\nPremiums for all of the aforementioned Medicare health insurance coverages can be combined with your other qualifying health care expenses for purposes of claiming an itemized deduction for medical expenses on your Form 1040. However for 2018, you can only claim an itemized medical expense deduction to the extent your total qualifying expenses exceed 7.5% of AGI. For 2019, the medical expense deduction threshold is scheduled to rise to a daunting 10% of AGI unless Congress extends the 7.5%-of-AGI deal.\n\nAnother factor: Because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly increased the standard deduction amounts for 2018-2025, fewer individuals will be itemizing. But having significant medical expenses (including those for Medicare health insurance premiums) may allow you to itemize and collect some tax savings.\n\nFor 2018, the standard deduction amounts are $12,000 for single filers, $24,000 for married joint-filing couples, and $18,000 for heads of households. For 2019, the standard deduction amounts are $12,200, $24,400, and $18,350, respectively.\n\nKey Point: If you are self-employed or an S corporation shareholder-employee, you can claim an above-the-line deduction for your health insurance premiums â€” including Medicare premiums. And you don't need to itemize to get the tax-savings.\n\nMedicare Premium Surchages for Higher-Income Folks\n\n2018 Part B Surcharges\n\nHigher-income individuals must pay a surcharge in addition to the base premium for Part B coverage. For 2018, surcharges apply to singles with 2016 MAGI in excess of $85,000 and married joint-filing couples with 2016 MAGI in excess of $170,000. Including the surcharges (which go up as 2016 MAGI goes up), the 2018 Part B monthly premium for each covered person can be $187.50 ($2,250 for the full year), $267.90 ($3,215 for the full year), $348.30 ($4,180 for the full year), or $428.60 ($5,143 for the full year). The maximum $428.60 premium applies to singles with 2016 MAGI in excess of $160,000 and married individuals who filed 2016 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $320,000.\n\n2019 Part B Surcharges\n\nFor 2019, the Part B surcharge depends on the MAGI amount from your 2017 Form 1040. Also, another MAGI category has been added to the surcharge structure for 2019. Surcharges apply to singles with 2017 MAGI in excess of $85,000 and married individuals who filed joint 2017 returns with MAGI in excess of $170,000. Including the surcharges (which go up as 2017 MAGI goes up), the 2019 Part B monthly premiums for each covered person can be $189.60 ($2,275 for the full year), $270.90 ($3,251 for the full year), $352.20 ($4,226 for the full year), $433.40 ($5,201 for the full year), or $460.50 ($5,526 for the full year) The maximum $460.50 premium applies to singles with 2017 MAGI in excess of $500,000 and married individuals who filed 2017 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $750,000.\n\n2018 Part D Surcharges\n\nFor 2018 the Part D surcharge depends on your 2016 MAGI and the surcharge goes up using the same MAGI scale as the aforementioned Part B premium surcharge. The monthly surcharge amounts for each covered person can be $13.00, $33.60, $54.20, or $74.80. The maximum $74.80 surcharge applies to singles with 2016 MAGI in excess of $160,000 and married individuals who filed 2016 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $320,000.\n\n2019 Part D Surcharges\n\nFor 2019 the Part D surcharges depend on your 2017 MAGI and they go up using the same MAGI scale as the Part B surcharges. The good news is the 2019 surcharges are slightly lower than for 2018, except for folks in the highest MAGI category. The 2019 monthly surcharge amounts for each covered person can be $12.40, $31.90, $51.40, $70.90, or $77.40. The maximum $77.40 surcharge applies to singles with 2017 MAGI in excess of $500,000 and married individuals who filed 2017 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $750,000.
HONG KONG (MarketWatch) â€” While China's equity turbulence appears to have temporarily paused, its main equity indices SHCOMP, +0.51% are now 15% lower since the start of the year, despite Beijing remaining committed to its policy of market intervention.\n\nIn some ways the government's hands are tied from last year's stock buying as it now has a substantial position to protect. Added to this, the original reason the party could not let its bull market die remains due to the potential political fallout from losses after it effectively orchestrated the bubble.\n\nBut in attempting to solve one problem, are policy makers just sowing the seeds of another? Attention is now turning to the collateral damage from official intervention to support stocks, in particular to the banks.\n\nChina's Wanda Buys Into Hollywood\n\nAnalysts are questioning the cost to China's state-owned yet overseas-listed banks, which have once again been called up for national service. The concern is that by acting as a buyer of last resort to prop up the stock market, this sets up China's banks to be the next fault line in the economy.\n\nIn a new report, rating agency Fitch warns of a clear conflict between banks struggling to manage state strategic roles and their profit goals.\n\nHow much intervention has come this year is still unknown, but last July after the initial stock market rout 17 banks, including the big five, were reported to have lent $200 billion.\n\nThere is also a pattern here. Last summer state-owned banks had to play another strategic role as they were strong-armed by the central government into a 3.2 trillion yuan debt-for-bond swap to help bail out local authorities.\n\nThe list of troubled assets needing help is unlikely to end there. The central government has prioritized cleaning up struggling state-owned enterprises, which, according to Societe Generale, includes some 30% that are bankrupt with 23 trillion yuan in liabilities.\n\nGiven this accumulation of questionable assets at the behest of the state, investors might feel somewhat anxious in case there ultimately is a reckoning.\n\nWhile Fitch notes these initiatives will harm profits, it does at least expect the central government rather than non-sovereign shareholders will be the banks' main source of funds if they do need additional capital.\n\nIf investors suspected that they would be forced to repeat the scenario from the global financial crisis when Western banks raised fresh capital from shareholders with deeply discounted share issues, stock prices would be vulnerable to steep falls.\n\nFitch's sanguine assumption of the central government stepping in depends on how much capital China's banks may need. Analyst Charlene Chu at Autonomous Economics, estimates this figure could be as high as $7.7 trillion of new capital in the next three years.\n\nSuch a figure would send the government debt-to-GDP ratio skyrocketing, which at around 22% is usually used to reaffirm China's robust financial position.\n\nAnother issue is that in China the overlap between corporates and the state can often make it difficult to get a true financial picture. For instance, hugely profitable state banks in recent years have by some estimates accounted for 50% of the net profits of all listed Chinese companies. This could mean if China's banks had to recognize a substantial increase in bad debts, another wild card is the impact on the central government's fiscal position through lost tax revenue.\n\nThe danger is that a possible policy misstep could compound problems if questions emerged on the government's support for the banks or its capacity to provide support.\n\nReports that the State Council is considering shaking up its various financial regulators by consolidating them, suggests that policy is still unclear.\n\nAdding to difficulties is the fact Beijing also has to navigate these challenges while facing accelerating capital outflows. Any central government cleanup of bad debt that revealed a significant deterioration in its fiscal position could heap more pressure on the yuan to weaken.\n\nAt the same time, China still has some $3.33 trillion of foreign reserves to support the yuan USDCNH, +0.31% yet it will be wary of using them up too aggressively as this contracts domestic liquidity. Authorities would be reluctant to tighten domestic monetary conditions excessively as this could hurt the property market. This remains pivotal, with estimates by analysts in the past that some 50% of banking collateral is related to real estate.\n\nIn the near term it should not be ruled out that more measures will be used to tighten capital controls. Currently, individuals can convert $50,000 per year into foreign currency.\n\nAs well as making foreign purchases of property overseas more difficult, another possibility is restrictions on Chinese tourists spending overseas.\n\nFor now Beijing's policy choice is between supporting the stock market and supporting the yuan. If it does not get this policy right, its next choice could be between supporting bank shareholders and depositors.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Friday he thinks the central bank will only raise interest rates twice this year, one fewer than the central bank's median forecast of three moves. In a speech at the American Economic Association meeting in Philadelphia, Harker said the central bank will be in monitoring mode this year. There is a lot to watch generally, and much of it, in some form or another, is new territory, Harker said. The Philadelphia Fed president said he expects growth a little below 2.5% this year. He forecast that inflation will rise above the Fed's 2% target in 2019. If soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem, he said. Harker is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate policy committee this year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday jumped to a fresh peak as a trio of bankers, headlined by current Chairman Jerome Powell, underscored the health of the U.S. economy but also expressed an attentiveness to a market that has grown fragile amid a spate of interest-rate increases. The Dow DJIA, -0.39% was up 616 points, or 2.7%, at 23,291, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% climbed 2.8% at 2,515, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% advanced 3.2%, producing the best intraday gains, to reach 6,671. The moves follow a better-than-expected job report that showed that 312,000 jobs were created in December, with the unemployment rate rising to 3.9%, as more workers entered the workforce. Against that backdrop, Powell, during an panel discussion featuring former Fed bosses, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at an event in Atlanta, said the employment report underlined the economy's health. He also said that the central bank would be willing to adjust policy if it disrupted the market or created adverse financial conditions, running against the central bank's statutory goals. The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since the end of 2015.
Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.88% slumped $2.58, or 1.1% in morning trade Tuesday, enough to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% into negative territory, after analyst Keith Horowitz at rival bank Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% turned bearish on Goldman, on the belief that investors may be too optimistic about revenue growth potential. The price decline was shaving 18 points off the Dow, which was down just 7 points. Horowitz downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral, saying the current stock valuation implies revenue growth of 18% off the 2016 base, while the FactSet revenue consensus for 2017 implies 7.6% growth. While we expect [Goldman] to see improved trading revenues going forward, the path is relatively uncertain and the bar is relatively high, Horowitz wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, Horowitz raised his stock price target to $225, which is 6.4% below current levels, from $200. The stock has rocketed 32% since the election, on optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's policy promises to slash regulation and boost fiscal stimulus, which would boost longer-term Treasury yields. In comparison, the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.52% has climbed 17% since the election while the Dow has gained 8.4%.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic on Monday said the central bank may only raise interest-rates once this year, according to several reports. In a talk in Atlanta, Bostic said he had previously penciled in two moves for this year.\n\nWhile the economy was healthy, Bostic said clouds have developed over the outlook and his business contacts were uncertain about the way forward.
U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump is the top risk to the global markets, according to a new Eurasia Group report released Tuesday.\n\nThe world's sole superpower was once the international trump card, imposing order to force compromise and head off conflict. Now it's the wildcard, the report concluded.\n\nTrump will not be an isolationist and will intervene strongly when he thinks U.S. interests are at stake, the report said. As a result, his policy will be more hawkish and much less predictable.\n\nU.S. foreign policy will be more akin to China, with narrow short-term agreements that are win-win for the two parties and everyone else be damned, said Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group's president, in an interview on Bloomberg.\n\nFinancial markets don't appreciate that this year marks the most volatile political risks environment in the postwar period, at least as important to global markets as the economic recession of 2008, he said.\n\nAllies, especially in Europe and Asia, will hedge. Rivals like Russia and China will test, the report said. For instance, China's President Xi Jinping may overreact to the new U.S. stance because he cannot afford to look weak and irresolute ahead of next fall's ruling Communist party congress.\n\nIn a separate interview on Bloomberg, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summer agreed Trump's likely truculent nationalism was a leading risk to the global economy.\n\nThe uncertainty premium on everything should go up, Summers said.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel will likely win reelection in 2017 but will emerge as a weakened figure, the report said.\n\nThis will leave Europe with no strong leadership at all â€” at a time when strong leaders are badly needed, the report said.
Get more from your money.\n\nFinancial uncertainty is in the air â€” with some experts predicting a coming recession, more stock market volatility and more consumers defaulting on their debts, among other issues.\n\n\n\nAnd while we don't know what will happen, that uncertainty makes 2019 a good time to shore up your savings, spend less so you can save more, pay down debt and invest smartly. So we asked experts what money moves they'd recommend taking in 2019. Here are 15 of them.\n\n1. Develop an investment policy statement, which is a document that outlines your investment goals and objectives and the strategies that you'll use to make them happen, says Mitchell C. Hockenbury, a certified financial planner at Kansas City-based 1440 Financial Partners. It might include information on your asset allocation, risk tolerance and more. He recommends taking Vanguard's Investor Questionnaire to help you develop the statement, or working with a professional on it.\n\nA statement like this can be very helpful in financially uncertain times, says Hockenbury: The purpose is to help you when you become anxious with big drops in the market. The last thing you want to do is to make poor investment decisions because of fear or greed.\n\n2. Rebalance your retirement accounts, says Darren L. Zagarola, a certified financial planner at EKS Associates in Princeton, making sure your asset allocation is in line with the goals from your investment policy statement. It can help to consolidate your 401(k) plans from old companies, which allows you to get a better handle on your investment strategy and risk level, says Andrew Westlin at Betterment.\n\n3. Make sure you have 3-6 months of income saved in an emergency fund, says Leanna Johannes, a senior wealth strategist at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia. This is a savvy move particularly during uncertain financial times, as it can help protect you in the event of a job loss or other emergency.\n\n4. Pay off your debt like this.Consumer debt hit record highs in 2018 â€“ so make this the year you tackle yours. The first step of your plan is figuring out the total debt you have, the type of debt and the interest rates on those debts, says Johannes. Then look for ways to consolidate your debt or lower your interest rates, she adds -- noting that you should negotiate lower rates if you can.\n\nTo tackle debt, consider aggressively paying off the highest interest debt and then the minimum on all others; once that is done, then tackle the next highest interest rate debt; and on and on until you're debt free. And if you struggle with credit card debt, Priya Malani, the founding partner at Stash Wealth in New York, recommends Tally, an app that consolidates credit card debt from multiple cards into one lower monthly payment.\n\n5. Move your savings online, says Malani. Most savings accounts are paying out very low rates right now so you want to earn as much money as you can. That's why she likes online banks like Ally and Marcus. They pay a higher rate of interest on their regular savings account than a typical brick-and-mortar bank, she says.\n\n6. Freeze your credit â€“ even if you don't suspect any foul play. This can protect you from people taking out credit cards and loans in your name in the future â€“ and as data breaches and identity theft are becoming more and more frequent, this may be smarter than ever. All three major credit agencies, Equifax, Experian and Transunion, allow you to freeze your credit file for free. Best of all, it only takes a few minutes to 'thaw' when you need to have your report pulled. This is the best way to be proactive in protecting your credit, says Hockenbury.\n\n7. Change your passwords for important logins like your bank, says Zagarola. This can help protect your accounts from getting hacked. Here's a guide on creating smart passwords.\n\n8. Make a concrete budget. You've heard this advice before but that doesn't make it any less relevant this year. Indeed, experts say this is the best way to get your spending under control, pay down debt and save more. This guide will help you make a budget in seven steps, or consider budgeting software like YNAB to help. One of the things that trips many people up is the semi-annual and annual payments, Hockenbury says -- which might include things like car insurance payments or annual memberships. Take the extra time to think through these types of expenditures, Hockenbury says.\n\n9. Save with purpose, says Malani. Rather than have one big savings account for everything, you should have different accounts for different goals: In 2019, put purpose behind your savings. Start by deciding what you're saving for (i.e. trip to Portugal, new West Elm couch, etc.). Then set up a separate savings account for each thing or experience you're saving for. Finally, nickname the savings account in accordance with its designated purpose. You'll be much less likely to 'borrow' money from your Portugal vacay account than just a general savings account, she explains.\n\nAnd make that savings automatic so you actually end up saving the money, she adds. Set up automatic transfers from your checking to your savings account at regular intervals. To boost savings even more, Malani recommends the app Digit: it will 'sneak' money out of it and save it for you. Promise you won't miss it and before you know it, you'll have a few hundred dollars saved up, she explains.\n\n10. Boost retirement contributions â€” even if it's just by 1%. At the very least, contribute enough to secure your employer's match, which is typically between 3% and 6%, says Johannes. Try to boost contributions every six months or so if you can.\n\n11. Get smarter about your credit score. Malani says you should check out your credit score using Creditwise from CapitalOne (you don't have to be a CapitalOne customer to use it). It shows you your credit score, why your score is where it is, and simulates how decisions like applying for a new loan might impact your score. It also has fraud alerts to let you know if someone is trying to use your personal information. If your score is low, here's a guide to boost it.\n\n12. Revisit your estate plan, says Zagarola. Review your wills to ensure that your wishes will be met at your death. Review the beneficiary designations of retirement accounts and life insurance to ensure they marry up with your estate planning wishes, he explains.\n\n13. Reward yourself. If you always pay off your credit card in full and on time, you should be earning credit card rewards. Use this tool from NerdWallet to get the best rewards card for your lifestyle. Love the idea of rewards but want to play it a little safer? Malani recommends the app Debitize. Use your credit card as you usually would to get rewards, but link it and your checking account to Debitize. Buy something on your credit card, and Debitize will pull the money out of your checking account each day and at the end of the month will pay your credit card bill in full.\n\n14. Shop around for new insurance. This can literally save you thousands this year. On car insurance alone, a good driver could save more than $400 a year by switching companies.\n\n15. Fight overdraft fees.Overdraft fees have been steadily rising, with Americans paying more now than they have since 2009. Here are some tips for fighting those fees. You can also try the free app Earnin, which allows you to borrow up to $100 from your pending paycheck rather than have to wait every two weeks and risk overdraft. The app allows you to pay what you think is fair for the service. Just beware of the potential pitfalls, including blowing your budget and overspending.
What makes the stock market move over the long term? While stocks have historically delivered positive returns year-over-year on average, it is not clear why stock prices rise more rapidly in one period than in any other.\n\nWith my colleagues, Martin Lettau of the U.C. Berkeley Haas School of Business and Sydney Ludvigson of New York University, I set out to investigate what makes stocks move over time. What we found was surprising.\n\nDespite the widespread belief that firm productivity is a key driver of stock market returns, our results indicate that fluctuations in productivity play only a small role. Far more influential over long periods is the economic redistribution between workers and shareholders â€” meaning how a company's profits are divided between employees and investors.\n\nOur first step in this research was to consider which factors might be responsible for movement in the stock market in aggregate. Each firm that is represented in the stock market index produces a stream of revenues. After paying a portion to workers, the rest is left over as profits that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends. The stock price will rise whenever the rewards to the shareholders increase, which can be caused by one of three separate forces:\n\nProductivity: The firm becomes more productive, increasing its stream of revenues. This increases the size of both slices, including the shareholders' slice. Redistribution: The size of the pie remains fixed, but the firm pays a smaller share to the workers, increasing the shareholders' slice. Market confidence: Neither the size nor the division of the pie changes, but more risk-tolerant investors demand more stock despite there being no change in their current dividends.\n\nCombining theoretical analysis with statistical estimation on macroeconomic and stock market data, we were able to determine the relative strengths of these three forces.\n\nHere's what we found: At short-term horizons of one-quarter to several years, market confidence shocks are dominant, explaining nearly all fluctuations. Essentially, short-run swings in stock prices are simply out of proportion to the movements in the underlying cash flows, ruling out the other two explanations.\n\nBut at longer horizons of a decade or more, we found that redistributions between workers and shareholders play an increasingly important role, explaining half of the variation in overall stock prices at a horizon of 25 years.\n\nThese redistributive shifts, taken individually, are quite small, and are not major factors in explaining quarterly returns. But unlike movements in market confidence, which tend to return to normal over a few quarters or years, these redistributive shifts are virtually permanent, allowing a sequence of small shifts to build up over time â€” with huge overall impact.\n\nHere's what Trump means for health care\n\nFor example, we estimate that if there had been no redistributive shifts since 1980, which mostly went in favor of shareholders, the level of the stock market in 2012 would have been only 56% of its observed value. However, these changes do not always favor shareholders. Case in point: the period from 1960 to 1980 saw substantial gains for workers at the expense of lower stock returns.\n\nFinally, fluctuations in productivity play little role over any time frame. Certainly, improvements in technology are important, and changes in productivity may be central to the performance of individual stocks. But for explaining why the market as a whole rose more in one period than another â€” be it a quarter, year, or decade â€” differences in aggregate productivity growth are rarely the story.\n\nSince financial researchers often assume that productivity is the key driver of stock prices, our results suggest that a major rethinking may be in order.\n\nIn the wake of Donald Trump's election, many are looking to the stock market to learn what is in store for the economy. While much of the short-run action likely reflects movements in market confidence or uncertainty, upcoming decisions on corporate taxes or labor policy may influence what shareholders ultimately receive. Our research implies that expectations regarding redistribution, rather than forecasts of overall economic performance, may play a crucial role in driving stock prices as the political agenda is revealed.\n\nDaniel Greewald is an assistant professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management.
All three main equity benchmarks posted record gains on Friday to end the first week of 2018 on a stellar footing, marked by four straight positive session, following lackluster jobs data.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% rose 220.74 points, or 0.9%, to 25,295.87. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% closed up 19.16 points, or 0.7%, at 2,743.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% gained 58.64 points to 7,136.56, a gain of 0.8%.\n\nFriday's rally meant that none of the equity indexes have posted a down day so far in 2018. For the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, it was the fourth straight closing record, while the Dow carved out its third in a row. The broad-market benchmark has closed at a record on the first four trading days of the new year, the first time it has done so since 1964, according to WSJ Market Data Group.\n\nFor the week, the Dow rose 2.3%, the S&P 500 gained 2.6%, while the Nasdaq is up 3.4%. The Dow notched the biggest weekly gain since the period ended Dec. 1, 2017, the S&P 500 recorded its best weekly rise since Nov. 11, 2016, and the Nasdaq logged its best climb over the same period since Dec. 9., 2016.\n\nThe small-cap focused Russell 2000 index RUT, -2.94% and the Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, -0.07% also closed at all-time highs.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nThe gains over the week have been buoyed by the recently passed corporate tax-cut package, rising commodity prices, and robust corporate earnings. Solid economic data and low bond yields have also been cited as contributing factors.\n\nDow Hits 25000: Here's Why It Matters\n\nWhat the data are saying?\n\nThe U.S. created 148,000 jobs in December. This was the slowest pace in three months, and below the 198,000 increase that economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1% for the third straight month. Worker pay increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017, up from 2.4% in the prior month.\n\nSeparately, the U.S. trade deficit widened 3.2% in November to $50.5 billion, the highest trade gap since January 2012. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a $50 billion gap.\n\nIn other economic news on Friday, the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index sank 1.5 points to 55.9% in December. U.S. factory orders rose 1.3% in November, a faster pace than had been expected, and the fourth straight monthly increase. A reading of 50 or better signifies improving activity.\n\nWhat are strategist saying?\n\nThe jobs report is a market-friendly number, in that it is good but not overheated. Investors should interpret this as Fed-friendly, in that the central bank will remain interested in the economy but not get overly aggressive in raising rates in 2018, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n\nWhile it came in below expectations, it wasn't sufficiently weak for investors to feel they should sell. Single months of data can be lumpy, but the average over the past few months shows that the labor market remains strong.\n\nFed speakers\n\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker on Friday said he thinks the U.S. central bank will only raise interest rates twice this year, one fewer than the Fed's median forecast of three increases in 2018.\n\nFed President of Cleveland Loretta Mester told CNBC on Friday that the jobs report was strong and that she could foresee three or four rate increases in 2018. I think we're basically at maximum employment from the view of monetary policy, she said.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nThe day's gains were broad, with seven of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors higher on the day. Tech shares were among the biggest gainers, up 1.2%, which helped to lift the broader Nasdaq, which has a heavy weighting to the sector. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.67% rose 1.2%, while Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -2.92% , the parent company of Google, added 1.3%.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, -3.39% rose 1.1%. The technology giant published information late Thursday that confirmed that all devices running its mobile and personal-computer operating systems are affected by two massive computer chip vulnerabilities.\n\nSpirits-and-beer company Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, -0.83% fell 2.6% after it reported sales that came in below analyst forecasts.\n\nU.S.-listed shares of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV US:FCAU gained 6.4% after J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. upgraded the car maker to overweight from neutral.\n\nShares of Cal-Maine Foods Inc. CALM, +1.33% dropped 6.9% after the company missed earnings estimates for its fiscal second quarter.\n\nAveXis Inc. US:AVXS finished down 2.5% in volatile trading. The gene-therapy company said late Thursday it was preparing to respond to Food and Drug Administration information requests about AveXis's primary gene therapy, which would be used to treat a form of spinal muscular atrophy.\n\nCellect Biotechnology Ltd. APOP, -1.93% rose 1.8% a day after announcing breakthrough results in a clinical trial, although the results were for just three patients.\n\nKala Pharmaceuticals Inc. KALA, -4.13% tumbled nearly 30% in heavy trading after it released results from two late-stage trials for its dry eye therapy KPI-121.\n\nWhat did the markets do?\n\nAsian stock markets continued to power higher, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index NIK, -1.17% ending at a 26-year high.\n\nIt was a similar story in Europe, where the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.40% rose 0.6%.\n\nThe dollar recorded its third weekly loss, but the ICE dollar index DXY, -0.03% finished slightly higher up 0.1% at 91.975.\n\nCrude-oil prices US:CLG8 retreated from a three-year high, settling at $61.44 a barrel, but posted a third straight weekly gain, while gold futures US:GCG8 settled higher at $1,322.30 an ounce, and marked its longest win streak, 11 straight sessions, in history.
The stock market is off to a rocky start this year, as the Dow industrials continued to slide on Thursday and touched a three-month low.\n\nBut there is hardly any sign of concern from any Federal Reserve officials.\n\nThat's not always, or even mostly, the case. Stock-market turbulence, both in the U.S. and China, is widely thought to have been the main reason why the Fed didn't raise interest rates this September, for instance. Traders have long speculated about a Greenspan, and then a Bernanke, and then a Yellen, put, referring to the option designed to protect investors from losses. The notion is that when stock markets get rough, Fed officials will rush to the rescue.\n\nSee also: Stock market live blog: China chaos sends global shock waves\n\nThis time, there has been no sign of any Fed official wanting to put on a firefighter hat â€” if anything, it's been the opposite.\n\nSan Francisco Fed President John Williams said a spillover of China's stock market declines into the U.S. wasn't a big concern.\n\nA lot of people will tell you China's stock market affects a relatively small share of Chinese citizens and doesn't affect the U.S. financial system that much directly. So to me those are not major concerns in terms of systemic risk right now, Williams said in an interview on CNBC on Monday.\n\nWilliams noted that China's economy is pivoting away from manufacturing to the service sector and therefore weaker data weren't a surprise.\n\nOn Wednesday, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer declined to express much concern about China, although he said uncertainty about the global economic outlook has risen a bit. He said the best forecast remained that the Fed would raise interest rates three to four times in 2016, more than the two rate increases markets have penciled in.\n\nFischer said it was hard to know precisely how developments in China would play out.\n\nFor the U.S., direct links with China are much less important than the role of China in the world. If all of China's neighbors and other parts of the world are negatively affected to a considerable extent by China then that would be an impact on the Fed, Fischer said.\n\nThe rest of the world matters for us, he said.\n\nFed officials have a difficult time responding when markets are moving sharply, said Nigel Gault, co-chief economist at the Parthenon Group in Boston.\n\nNo Fed official wants to inflame the stock market by saying their views have changed and things look massively worse, he said.\n\nOver time, Fed officials must stress that the four rate increases in their baseline projection is not preprogrammed, he said.\n\nEconomists generally think the next time the Fed could raise interest rates is in 10 weeks, at its March 15-16 meeting, as officials are widely expected to stand pat on policy when they meet at end of this month.\n\nMeanwhile, signaling that rate increases might be delayed given market turmoil or a worsening global economic outlook would just build in more volatility, said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP.\n\nThe majority on the Fed believes that domestic demand in the U.S. economy is strong enough now to power through global weakness. At the December meeting, when the Fed raised interest rates from the near-zero level that had existed since late 2008, officials said downside risks from global economic and financial developments had diminished since late summer, according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday.\n\nRead more:Some on Fed viewed historic December hike with trepidation\n\nThere was little concern expressed about market unease with the Fed's decision to hike rates even as inflation remained low around the world and other major central banks were easing policy.\n\nOfficials dismissed market queasiness, which in December was concentrated in the market for low-rated corporate debt.\n\nInstead, some Fed officials said they were on the lookout for signs of markets overheating, an indication the Fed was moving too slow.\n\nIf the Fed is data-dependent, then right now, they won't raise interest rates in March, Gault said.\n\nHe noted that fourth-quarter GDP is expected to come in below 1% and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index has been signaling a contraction in the sector for two months.\n\nWhite House reaction\n\nAsked about China's decision to let its currency fall to the weakest level in four years, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration is monitoring the situation and staying in close touch with Chinese officials.\n\nEarnest said it would be a mistake to make snap judgments on China's willingness to enact needed reforms of its economy based on one day's activity in the market.\n\nThe U.S. is focused on China's longer-term commitment to enact market-friendly reforms, he added.
Europe's main stock gauge closed slightly lower, after gains sparked by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's remarks failed to stick.\n\nThe ECB chief struck a markedly dovish tone, emphasizing downside risks to the inflation outlook and reiterating that the bank's bond buying program can be extended or expanded, if needed.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.40% finished down less than 0.1% at 362.85. The pan-European benchmark had risen in afternoon action to around 364, after trading as low as 361.66 ahead of the ECB event.\n\nAt the first policy-setting meeting this year, the central bank left its key refinancing rate at 0% and the deposit rate at negative 0.4%, as was widely expected. Policy makers also made no changes to the ECB's 80-billion-euro-a-month bond-buying program.\n\nAt a press conference after the rate announcement, Draghi fended off questions about rapidly rising consumer prices in the eurozone. He said there are no signs yet of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation.\n\nThe ECB has adopted an aggressive easing program and negative deposit rate to try to get inflation back to a target of around 2%.\n\nAt its last meeting, the bank said it would extend its quantitative easing program to end in December 2017, rather than in March 2017. However, it reduced its bond buying to â‚¬60 billion a month from the current â‚¬80 billion.\n\nIf the outlook becomes less favorable, or if financial conditions become inconsistent with further progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we stand ready to increase our asset purchase program in terms of size and/or duration, the ECB said in its policy statement.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.04% dropped under $1.06 after the comments, but the shared currency was recently buying $1.0633, compared with $1.0630 late Wednesday in New York.\n\nWhy is the ECB leaving the QE taps on while inflation and growth [are] showing signs of picking up? Today we learned whyâ€”according to Draghi, the ECB has yet to see any signs of a convincing upward trend in core inflation. It was this that sent the euro lower as traders reacted, said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, in a note.\n\nIn other words, don't take the recent data at face value. It could be a blip, and the risks remain to the downside. Sensible, measured and characteristically dovishâ€”as you'd expect from Draghi, he said.\n\nItalian minister on banking, populism in Italy\n\nOther indexes: Germany's DAX 30 index DAX, +1.23% closed down less than 0.1% at 11,596.89, while France's CAC 40 index PX1, +0.13% gave up 0.1% to end at 4,841.14.\n\nThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.25% lost 0.5% to end at 7,208.44.

Many are hoping that when Donald Trumpâ€”one of the most divisive U.S. presidents in the past century or moreâ€”leaves office, the historically elevated levels of partisanship in U.S. politics will at least begin to subside. But the opposite is vastly more likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are short- and intermediate-run, as well as long-run reasons for this result that have little to do with the Trump phenomenon. Most important and immediately, there is a gigantic and increasingly unbridgeable divide on economic policy. And the outcome of this ongoing fight will have an enormous impact on the lives and livelihoods of most Americans.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal policy lessons\n\nFirst and foremost, there is fiscal policy: the federal government's use of spending and taxation, in this case to facilitate an economic recovery. The Republicans will try to block most helpful spending as much as possible, perhaps most important as a fundamental part of their political strategy.\n\n The Republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country. \n\nThey learned something from the Great Recession of 2008-09. They fought and reduced Democratic stimulus plansâ€”which were not big enough to begin withâ€”as much as possible. The end result was unemployment in October 2010 was still at 9.4%; and millions more jobs were lacking if we look at the decline in employment since the recession, rather than the unemployment stats only.\n\nThis was a resounding success, from their point of view. In the November 2010 elections, Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House, flipping control of the chamber, and gained six seats in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of Republican Party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the Democrats take office. And finally, there are also some true believers in high Republican places; Mitch McConnell used some of these in the Senate to tell Trump no can do just before the election, when Trump leaned on Republican senators to reach a deal with the Democrats on the Heroes 2.0 COVID stimulus bill. Trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with Senate Republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate Republicans also showed their determination to deprive the unemployed of benefits as far back as July, when they waited until just four days before unemployment benefits expired, before even responding to the Democrats' proposal that would renew them.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermining the level of employment\n\nFiscal and monetary policy are in general the main determinants of the level of employment and unemployment in our economy, as well as economic recovery at present.\n\nNearly four million people have now been without work for six months or longer.\n\nThis is of course vitally important when the economy is still down more than 9 million jobs since February. We have an estimated 26 million people who are going hungry in the United States, and some 7 million to 14 million at risk of eviction. And many of the jobs lost in the hardest-hit industries, such as retail and hospitality, will not be coming back. Many workers will have to change occupations and some will be unemployed long-term; at present, the percent of unemployed who are long-term (more than six months out of work) is at 36.9%, up from 19.2% in February.\n\nNow read this: U.S. economy may have lost jobs in December for first time since earliest stages of coronavirus pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch more spending will be necessary just to pull the economy back to the levels of employment and unemployment that we had before the COVID recession, and to help the millions who have been hurt by the pandemic. We still don't even know how much worse the pandemic itself will get before the effects of vaccination can seriously reduce infection rates.\n\nYet Republicans have fought tenaciouslyâ€”even contributing to their own loss of the presidencyâ€”in order to block desperately needed funding for health care and education to state governments.\n\nMore on the economy: Former Obama economist questions wisdom of stimulus checks\n\n\n\nIt appears that the Republican leadership's recent willingness to finally negotiate a COVID relief package was driven by the risk that continued refusal could result in losing the Jan. 5 runoff election for the two senators from Georgia. This election will determine who controls the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tyranny of the minority\n\nAll this is just a glimpse of what one part of one big policy differenceâ€”on fiscal policyâ€”between the two parties in power would mean for the most of Americans in the immediate and near future. Over the longer run, it means much more. For it is now well-established that America is structurally set up for minority rule. And that minority is the Republican Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past four decades these structures have grown in their political importance, size and scope. This applies to gerrymandering, as in the Republicans winning a 33-seat majority in the House of Representatives in 2012, with more than a million fewer votes than the Democrats. It applies to the Electoral College, with eight of the past 20 years under Republican presidents (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) who lost the popular vote; and to the Senate, where about half the U.S. population elects 80% of the Senate, while the other half gets 20%. And then there is voter suppression that targets minority and poorer voters, and disenfranchises them disproportionately.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural reforms will be needed just to make the country into enough of a democracy so that we can actually vote for governments that might treat some of the pathologies that have been cultivated over the past few decades.\n\nThese include an explosion of inequality that has doubled the income share of the richest 1%, and the institutional racism that in 2020 set off the largest protests in U.S. history. Not to mention the democratic governance we would need to move forward on the investments necessary to tackle the climate crisis before it is too late.\n\nThe Republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country, and that would thereby vastly reduce their chances of holding national power. Together with the policy differences between the parties, this reality will remain the long-run, material basis for an increasing partisan divide, until these structural problems are resolved.\n\n\n\nMark Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C.

While the Capitol was under siege last week, Democrats regained control of the Senate after Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff were declared victors in Georgia's runoff Senate elections.\n\nThat's likely to lead to significant changes for the estimated 10 million Americans who are currently receiving unemployment benefits.\n\nUnder the recently passed stimulus package, jobless Americans will be receiving an additional $300 in weekly federal unemployment benefits on top of their state unemployment benefits.\n\nThe legislation also calls for an 11-week extension of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which allows self-employed workers, independent contractors and gig workers to continue to collect unemployment benefits.\n\nAfter March 14, millions of jobless Americans are heading for the same income cliff they were set to face had lawmakers not passed another stimulus package in late December. That's when the $300 add-on benefit is scheduled to expire, as well as the PUA program.\n\nWhile the vaccine is being administered, it will take the better part of a year to widely distribute, said Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden in a statement to MarketWatch. The hardest-hit service industries are not going to come back right away, and continued relief, especially for workers experiencing long-term joblessness, is going to be critical.\n\nMy starting point here is going to be my legislation that would reinstate the full $600 weekly and tie additional weeks of benefits and the program for gig workers to economic conditions, said Wyden, who will lead the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n**The $600 weekly benefit, part of the CARES Act, expired at the end of July. Many Republican lawmakers opposed extending it because of research that found that two-thirds of unemployed Americans were receiving more in unemployment benefits than they were from working.\n\nDon't miss: Gig workers are eligible for extra unemployment under new stimulus deal â€” but they must clear one big hurdle first\n\nDemocratic lawmakers who will control the House and the Senate, with the support of President-elect Joe Biden, are likely to be very focused on making sure that workers don't hit an unemployment cliff in mid-March that was in the stimulus bill, said Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Century Foundation.\n\nThat's more likely to mean extending the $300 rather than reimplementing the $600. It would also mean extending the PUA program, he said echoing Wyden's statement.\n\nGregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, is less confident that lawmakers will take action to extend the $300 add-on benefit. By March you're going to see a low number of people that are essentially on the regular unemployment rolls. We are expecting the labor market to improve, he said.\n\nAt that point, more people are likely to be receiving unemployment benefits through the PUA program and through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Assistance program that provides benefits to Americans who have exhausted their state benefits, according to Daco. Hence lawmakers will be less likely to extend the $300 supplemental benefit.\n\nEven though Democrats will hold a majority in the Senate, it is slim, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris poised to make key tie-breaking votes. That means that any proposals will need to capture bipartisan support, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy organization focused on workers' rights.\n\nOriginally the bipartisan-backed Senate stimulus proposal called for a 16-week extension of PUA and PEUA and the $300 add-on. If that center group comes together again, I think there's real potential for something like that, she said.\n\nAlso see: Jobless claims dip to 787,000 in first week of new year, but layoffs still running high\n\nUltimately, Evermore said lawmakers are likely to take significant action to make permanent and serious reform to unemployment insurance programs. That could involve introducing legislation that increases the minimum amount of benefits and the number of weeks of benefits individuals can qualify for in their respective states.\n\nNotably, Americans in six states have been receiving less than the equivalent of the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage in unemployment benefits, without any form of enhanced benefits.\n\nWe're never going to have another time that people are caring enough about unemployment insurance to do it, she said.
Asian equity markets reversed early gains to end broadly lower on Thursday, as investors sought to take profits amid the prevailing global political uncertainties.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.51% ended down 0.6%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +1.28% declined 0.5% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 XJO, -0.73% fell 0.1%.\n\nInvestors believe that the recent rally in Asian equities would be unsustainable once Donald Trump assumes the U.S. presidency, said Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International.\n\nTrump is not the usual sort of a guy, he is unpredictable, he said.\n\nIn his first news conference in months on Wednesday, Trump named China, Japan and Mexico as countries with which the U.S. has a trade imbalance, though he stopped short of making fresh attacks against global trade.\n\nNonetheless, this was the first time Trump named Japan as benefiting from a trade imbalance with the U.S., raising some concern among investors in the Asian country, and contributing to a 1.2% slump in the Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +1.01% on Thursday.\n\nThe Japanese government was thoroughly analyzing Trump's comments, the country's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said Thursday, though he refrained from commenting directly on Trump's remarks.\n\nThe Japanese government believes active and free trade investments are the engine and source of the U.S. and Japanese economies, he said.\n\nThe Nikkei's decline also came as the yen strengthened markedly against the U.S. dollar on Thursday, with the dollar-yen pair USDJPY, +0.03% down 1.2% at Â¥114.07. A stronger yen hurts Japanese exports.\n\nAmong key export stocks, Mazda Motor 7261, +0.22% ended down 1.5%, with Toyota Motor 7203, +4.12% falling 1%. Meanwhile, financial stocks were hurt as yields of long-term Japanese government bonds moved lower, with investors turning to the safe-haven asset amid the stocks decline.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump offered little clarity on his economic stimulus plans, disappointing the market and sending the U.S. dollar down against major currencies.\n\nThe President-elect was fairly light on policy details, leaving the market none the wiser in many respects, said Alex Furber, a sales trader at CMC Markets.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.41% , which measures the U.S. currency against six others, was last down 0.6% in late Asian trade.\n\nWho will be South Korea's next president?\n\nAs against other Asian currencies, the greenback was off 0.5% versus the Chinese yuan, 0.3% lower against the Thai baht and 0.7% lower against the Korean won.\n\nThe reaction of markets -- especially a sharp decline in the U.S. dollar -- suggests that markets were very disappointed in the lack of economic detail during an hour-long appearance, UOB Kay Hian analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann said in a note to clients.\n\nLooking ahead, investor focus will likely turn to earnings results, with Delta Air Lines DAL, -2.50% scheduled to kick off the U.S. reporting season later Thursday.\n\nâ€”Hiroyuki Kachi, Eleanor Warnock, Megumi Fujikawa and Anjie Zheng contributed to this article.
Jay Clayton, the Wall Street lawyer picked on Wednesday by President-elect Donald Trump as his nominee to be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has such a small public presence that major wire services don't even have a photograph of him.\n\nHis public pronouncement at being nominated suggests he wants to ease regulations. If confirmed, we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs, Clayton said in a prepared statement.\n\nHis profile at Sullivan & Cromwell, the law firm known in particular for its representation of J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +1.65% and other Wall Street titans, suggests one area of focus could be reforming the agency's prosecution of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nA 2011 paper Clayton was involved in drafting for the New York City Bar Association complains about the federal government's broad enforcement of that law. The paper â€” titled The FCPA and its Impact on International Business Transactions: Should Anything Be Done to Minimize the Consequences of the U.S.'s Unique Position on Combating Offshore Corruption? â€” states that foreign companies are leery of deals that would bring them under the act's jurisdiction, such as listing on a U.S. exchange in an initial public offering or acquiring a U.S. company in a stock-for-stock exchange.\n\nRelated story:Trump's SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure\n\nThat hasn't deterred them completely, of course. In 2015, foreign companies represented about 16% of all U.S. public offerings, according to data from S&P Capital IQ, and a similar percentage in 2016 through November. Clayton himself helped represent Alibaba BABA, +1.32% in its New York Stock Exchange listing, which was the largest IPO of all time, not to mention the largest Chinese listing in the U.S.\n\nBut the SEC has been active in FCPA prosecution. Last year, 27 companies paid $2.48 billion to resolve FCPA cases, the biggest enforcement year in history, according to the FCPA blog.\n\nIt's also the types of cases the SEC has brought that have raised some eyebrows. One high-profile case that wrapped up in November was a $264 million fine brought against J.P. Morgan over its sons and daughters program in China, wherein the bank gave prestigious jobs to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials to win business.\n\nA number of other Wall Street banks â€” including Deutsche Bank DB, +2.70% , an institution President-elect Trump does much of his business with â€” are facing similar charges, according to regulatory filings. Such conduct hasn't until recently been a target of FCPA prosecutions.\n\nClayton didn't represent J.P. Morgan in that matter.\n\nHe did represent Italian oil group Eni in an FCPA case over allegations that it bribed Nigerian government officials with cash-filled suitcases.
The U.S. set a fresh record for hospitalizations with the coronavirus-borne illness COVID-19 on Wednesday, as experts said the new, far more infectious variant makes it even more crucial to get the nation's so-far underwhelming vaccine program on track.\n\nThe U.S. added at least 238,999 new cases on Tuesday and at least 3,664 people died, according to a New York Times tracker. The U.S. has averaged 219,684 new cases every day in the past week, confirming the worst case scenario forecasts of experts who said the holiday season would lead to fresh surges.\n\nThere was a record of 131,195 COVID-19 patients in U.S. hospitals on Tuesday, according to the COVID Tracking Project, breaking the record of 128,210 set a day earlier. The U.S. continues to lead the world by cases, at 21 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and by deaths, at 359,077, or about a fifth of the global total.\n\nThe new variant of the virus, that first emerged in the U.K. where it has run rampant, has been found across the U.S. and is likely spreading in communities.\n\n 'We should expect, without further action, that as the new strain takes hold, we will see an additional 10 million infections in the U.S. between now and end of February and during that time, we could easily see an additional 100,000 to 150,000 deaths.'  â€” Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean and professor of health services, policy and practice, Brown University School of Public Health\n\nIt is, at this point, almost surely too widespread to be contained in any specific state or region of our country, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean and professor of health services, policy and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, in a statement. This new variant is significantly more infectious, threatening a rapid increase in rates of new cases and a much, much more deadly and destructive pandemic. This demands an urgent rethinking of our current policy responses.\n\nThe variant has been named B.1.1.7 and is estimated to be 40% to 70% more infectious than the original virus, said Jha, although it does not so far seem to make people sicker. Officials expect it to respond to the vaccines that have so far been granted emergency use authorization for use in the pandemic. A strain that Jha called a close cousin of the new variant has been found in South Africa and the U.K. but has not yet been detected in the U.S.\n\nA significant increase in rates of infection will translate into a much, much more deadly pandemic, he said.\n\nOne epidemiologist, (Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine), comparing a 50% increase in severity of disease with a 50% increase in infectiousness, in a hypothetical in a town with 10,000 infections increased infectiousness would lead to a five-fold increase in deaths over a month â€“ because a lower death rate of a very large number of cases produces many more deaths than a higher death rate but a lower number of cases, said Jha.\n\nThe new variant is estimated to account for about 1% of all infections now, but will likely account for the vast majority by March.\n\nWe should expect, without further action, that as the new strain takes hold, we will see an additional 10 million infections in the U.S. between now and end of February and during that time, we could easily see an additional 100,000 to 150,000 deaths, he said.\n\nThat means it is more important than ever for Americans to comply with public safety measures experts have recommended throughout the pandemic, namely frequent hand washing, social distancing and wearing a face mask in all public spaces. People should avoid gatherings that bring more than one household together, and testing must be improved, he said.\n\nAnd finally, we must redouble our efforts to vaccinate as many people as we possibly can, said Jha.\n\nRead now:There is only a slim chance that the vaccine will stop the COVID pandemic this year\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine tracker shows that just 4.8 million people had been dosed as of 9.00 a.m. ET on Jan. 5, and just 17 million doses had been distributed. That's far below the most recently revised number of 20 million deliveries promised by the administration of President Donald Trump, and way off the original promise of 100 million.\n\nTrump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program â€” tweeting that it was up to the states to administer and then calling some states very slow â€” meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.\n\nSee: January will be worst month for U.S. pandemic so far with post-holiday travel cases seen surging\n\nIn other news:\n\nâ€¢ The European Union has granted emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. MRNA, -5.43% , MarketWatch's Jack Denton reported. The European Commission is expected to quickly grant authorization for the vaccine, allowing it to be deployed across Europe, where COVID-19 infections remain very high and millions of people continue to live under strict lockdown measures. The prospective clearance of the Moderna vaccine comes as governments across Europe face challenges in rolling out the vaccine at scale. In France, President Emmanuel Macron faces national criticism over the inoculation campaign, which lags its European peers.\n\nâ€¢ The head of the World Health Organization said that he is disappointed Chinese officials haven't finalized the permissions to allow a team of experts into China to examine the origins of COVID-19, the Associated Press reported. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, said members of the international scientific team began departing from their home countries over the last 24 hours as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government. Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalized the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China, Tedros said during a news conference in Geneva. I'm very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute, but had been in contact with senior Chinese officials, he said.\n\nâ€¢ The Netherlands is finally preparing to start its COVID-19 vaccine program, becoming the last country in the EU to do so, the BBC reported. The Dutch government has come in for criticism over the delay, with former public health director, Roel Coutinho, warning the country's shameful vaccination strategy was going to cost lives. During an emergency debate in parliament, opposition politicians called the approach chaotic and confusing. The Netherlands has 852,921 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the Johns Hopkins data show, and at least 12,095 people have died.\n\nâ€¢ The Geneva-based Press Emblem Campaign nongovernmental organization said Wednesday that more than 600 journalists have died of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, with Latin America leading with more than half of known victims, AFP reported. At least 145 deaths were recorded in Asia, with 94 in Europe, 23 in North America and 28 in Africa. The press freedom group called for journalists to have priority access to vaccines upon request.\n\nDon't miss:Telemedicine provides people with a lifeline during the pandemic â€” but once again highlights the divide between rich and poor\n\nâ€¢ CVS Health Corp.

The program allows both residents and employees of the facilities to get one of the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines right now; both groups are considered by the U.S. government to be at high risk of contracting the coronavirus. CVS said it also plans to publish its national and state vaccination figures every day at 4 p.m. It also said that while uptake among residents remains encouragingly high, the actual number of residents is about 20% to 30% lower than facility projections that were based on bed count. Initial uptake among staff is low, part of which is likely due to facilities wanting to stagger vaccinations between visits, said the drugstore chain.\n\nStudents Share Lessons From Their Virtual 2020\n\nLatest tallies\n\nThe number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide climbed above 86.7 million on Wednesday, the Johns Hopkins data show, and the death toll rose to 1.9 million.

Equities in Hong Kong and mainland China led gains in the Asia-Pacific region Tuesday, though stocks in Malaysia and Australia fell to begin the new year.\n\nThe Hang Seng Index HSI, -1.55% ended 2% higher, and the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -1.45% climbed 1.2%.\n\nChinese messaging-and-gaming heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s 700, -1.87% 2.9% gain contributed to the Hang Seng's advance, setting the index is within 3.6% of 2007's record intraday close.\n\nMost of the bad news is behind us and some stocks are seen as underpriced by speculative buyers, said Linus Yip, an equities strategist at First Shanghai Securities.\n\nLate last year, Hong Kong-listed Sunny Optical Technology Group 2382, -1.63% and AAC Technologies 2018, -1.51% lost about a third of their market value in a month, following a global tech pullback which began in November. On Tuesday, the suppliers of smartphone components jumped 9.2% and 7.5% respectively.\n\nLargan Precision Co. Ltd. 3008, -2.34% , which makes lenses for smartphone cameras, closed up 5.9% in Taiwan after skidding 22% in December. It helped the Taiex XX:Y9999 end 0.6% higher and finish at a five-week best.\n\nSolid Chinese manufacturing data showed the sector remained healthy, said Krystal Tan of Capital Economics. Global economic growth and accommodative domestic monetary policy should help keep Asian manufacturing sectors in good shape, she said.\n\nSouth Korea's Kospi Composite Index 180721, -0.60% ended 0.5%. The gain came as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in a speech on Monday that his country would be open to sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in the South next month.\n\nThe government in Seoul welcomed Kim's suggestion on Tuesday. Its unification minister proposed holding high-level talks with North Korean officials on Jan. 9 to discuss the country's possible involvement in the Winter Games and Kim Jong Un's nuclear program.\n\nOne laggard Tuesday was Australia, where the stock benchmark XJO, -0.42% fell 0.1% despite gains in commodity stocks. Banks, a big portion of the equities market there, started 2018 lower. Analysts have previously expressed concerns that higher global interest rates could add to the economic pressure from high household debt in Australia. The S&P/ASX 200 overall ended 2017 with its best three months since the first quarter of 2015.\n\nMalaysia's index also fell 0.8% to reverse the sharp adjustment higher at the end of Friday's trading. Big end-of-session gains of some 10% seen in the likes of Sime Darby Plantation and KLCC Property were largely reversed Tuesday.\n\nThe drop came as neighboring Singapore logged a 0.8% gain.

Treasury yields fell Thursday in volatile trading after investors gave a dovish reading of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's remarks.\n\nThe yield for the benchmark 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% fell 2.6 basis points to 2.628%. The two-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% was up 0.4 basis points to 2.088%. However, the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% slipped 4.6 basis points to 2.891%, the biggest one-day declines since Dec. 27.\n\nBond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nWhat's driving markets?\n\nAs expected, the ECB kept monetary policy unchanged. The central bank said it would leave interest rates at current levels well past the end of its asset-purchase program, set to finish in September.\n\nDraghi insisted on the need for monetary policy to stay accommodative until inflation nears the central bank's target of 2%. He also added officials have yet to discuss how the ECB would go about ending quantitative easing, and that rate increases would only follow after the process had begun.\n\nComplicating this process has been the euro's EURUSD, -0.03% relentless rise, which analysts say may dampen inflation and prove an unwelcome stumbling block for the ECB. Amid the currency's gains, Draghi alluded to how the U.S. may have been trying to devalue its currency to boost American exports. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday touted the benefits of a weak dollar, only for President Donald Trump to later downplay Mnuchin's comments.\n\nSee: Here's why Trump's weak-dollar policy is Mario Draghi's problem\n\nInvestors are closely watching when the European Central Bank will make its momentous shift away from easy-money policies, because negative-to-low interest rates in Europe have been blamed for depressing yields for U.S. government paper.\n\nECB recap: Draghi offers warning on euro, but shared currency continues surge\n\nWhat are market participants saying?\n\nMr Draghi poured cold water on the idea of a rate rise this year and repeatedly said rates would be on hold until 'well past' the end of QE. The ECB also has concerns about the stronger euro. Combined, these probably outweigh the hawkish words on accelerating growth and Mr. Draghi rowing back a bit on his assertion that there would be no 'sudden end' to QE, said economists at HSBC.\n\nWhat else is on investors' radar?\n\nNew home sales ran at annual rate of 625,000 in December, 9.3% lower than November, but 14.1% higher than a year ago. The reading fell below the 680,000 forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch. Initial weekly jobless claims rose by 17,000 to 233,000 for the seven-day period ending Jan. 20.\n\nWhat are other assets doing?
Gold futures finished higher on Monday, staging a partial rebound from their worst single-session drop in two weeks, with prices getting a boost as downbeat U.S. ISM nonmanufacturing data helped pressure the dollar.\n\nFebruary gold on Comex US:GCG9 gained $4.10, or 0.3%, to settle at $1,289.90 an ounce, following a 0.7% fall on Friday, its largest daily drop since Dec. 21, according to FactSet data. For the week, gold futures rose about 0.2%, following gains in each of the last two weeks.\n\nMarch silver US:SIH9, meanwhile, shed 3 cents, or 0.2%, to $15.756 an ounce, after gold's sister metal fell 0.1% to end last week, with prices producing a weekly gain of about 2.3%.\n\nSome strategists maintain a bullish outlook for bullion and other precious metals on the back of expectations for continued volatility in global markets that have whipsawed so-called risk assets, highlighted by choppy trade in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% , in the past several months.\n\nFor gold, the main trend remains bullish, even though the resistance of $1,300 still seems out of reach for now, wrote Carlo Alberto De Casa, chief analyst, at brokerage ActivTrades, in a Monday research note.\n\nOn Friday, appetite for havens receded sharply after labor market data showed that the U.S. created a better-than-expected 312,000 new jobs in December to bring total employment gains in 2018 to a three-year high of 2.64 million. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9% as labor participation rose. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a gain of 182,000 nonfarm jobs.\n\nThe upbeat data also came as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized that the central bank intended to take a path toward normalizing interest-rate policy that wouldn't ignore signs of disruptions to financial stability.\n\nPowell's remarks suggested to some that the Fed may hike rates at a more measured pace, news that may provide long-term support for gold which tends to see weakened investment appetite when interest rates are competitively richer. Gold doesn't offer a yield.\n\nSoftness in the U.S. dollar also offered a runway for gold to rise. A weaker dollar can make assets pegged to the currency more appealing to buyer using other monetary units. One measure of the buck, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% , was off 0.5% at 95.661 as gold futures settled.\n\nData Monday showed that activity at service-oriented U.S. firms grew in December at the slowest pace since midsummer. The nonmanufacturing index issued by the Institute for Supply Management fell to 57.6 last month from 60.7 in November.\n\nThe dollar also weakened as the British pound GBPUSD, -0.06% strengthened against the greenback, ahead of a vote next week on U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan.\n\nFor now, worries about tariffs, [U.S.-]China talks, Brexit, politics and [the U.S.] government shutdown are enough to add to gold, said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, in a daily note.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, March copper US:HGH9 fell by 0.4% to $2.637 a pound. April US:PLJ9 settled at $824.30 an ounce, down 0.4%. March palladium US:PAH9 added 0.5%, to $1,240.20 an ounceâ€”another record settlement on Comex.\n\nRead:Palladium hits another record, inches closer to the price of gold
Gold futures proved unable to hang on to early gains, ending with a small loss as the dollar pared its decline.\n\nGold initially found haven-related support as global equities and Treasurys saw renewed selling pressure, analysts said. But while the U.S. dollar remained under pressure, the currency trimmed initial losses, which appeared to sap support for the metal.\n\nGold also moves inversely to the dollar. A cheaper greenback makes gold cheaper to buyers using other currencies and vice versa. Analysts said a prolonged stock market selloff could provide a lift for the metal, but jitters ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting might have dented near-term enthusiasm.\n\nGold is still in the same positive trend it has been in since December, but seeing as tomorrow is the Federal Reserve update, traders may not be too keen to stay long going into the meeting, said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nFebruary gold futures US:GCG8 fell $4.90, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,335.40 an ounce. March silver US:SIH8 lost 7 cents, or 0.4%, to finish at $17.06 an ounce. The exchange-traded SPDR Gold Shares GLD, -0.58% declined 0.4% while the silver-focused iShares Silver Trust SLV, -1.31% was 0.3% lower.\n\nGlobal equities were weaker with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking 400 points at its low. Treasurys remained under pressure, with the yield on the 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% pushing back above 2.7%. Yields rise as debt prices fall.\n\nRising yields can often be seen as a negative for gold, in part because the commodity offers no yield and because rising yields can contribute to a stronger dollar. But the currency has been under pressure as yields have edged higher, further boosting demand for gold. The ICE U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.03% , a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was off 0.3% at 89.07. A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive.\n\nHow to invest in gold\n\nOn the economic front, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city index climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in November, and 6.2% for the year. Consumer confidence also rose in January to 125.4 from a revised 123.1 at the end of 2017, the Conference Board said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's rate-setting panel begins a two-day policy meeting that is expected to underline investor expectations for a March rate increase.\n\nIn other metals trade, April platinum US:PLJ8 fell 1.1% to $1,001.80 an ounce, while March palladium US:PAH8 declined 2.9% to $1,052.45 an ounce. March copper US:HGH8 dropped 0.2% to end at $3.194 a pound.
Americans love products and services that don't require a lot of hand-holding.\n\nOur smartphone cameras automatically detect faces and focus for perfect snapshots. Thermostats learn our preferences and adjust heating or cooling based on time of day and whether anyone is home. Some cars can now even relieve us from the misery of parallel parking.\n\nWhen it comes to our investments, a similar set-it-and-forget-it mentality has been popular for decades now. It started with mutual funds, migrated to index funds, and now has evolved into the even simpler target-date fund. Many people became familiar with this concept through the development of 529 college savings plans. You would simply contribute, and the investment decisions would be managed based on your child's anticipated graduation date.\n\nAs employers have moved away from the simplicity and security of defined-benefit pension plans, employees have taken on more responsibility for retirement through defined contribution programs like 401(k) plans. With more workers taking a bigger role in their own financial futures, investment managers have sought to make the complicated decisions about asset allocation and risk management a bit simpler.\n\nNow, many future retirees rely on target-date funds (also known as TDFs) for their own retirement savings plans. No longer do they have to fret about the mix of stocks and bonds. They don't have to do the research and evaluation needed to regularly rebalance their portfolios. They simply decide how much to contribute alongside their employers, and the experts address all the other decisions.\n\nThe expectation of these workers is that when it comes time for them to retire, their contributions will have grown into a nest egg that can support their golden years.\n\nRead: Should you have your entire 401(k) in a target-date fund?\n\nThe core concept of target-date funds is that they start out with a more aggressive investment mix designed to focus on growing value rapidly. As the retirement target date nears, the investment mix becomes progressively more conservative, since the time period to correct for poor investment experience or unfavorable market conditions is shorter.\n\nWith target-date funds, the investment fund managers must make the difficult choices to accomplish the objective of managing risk appropriately while still achieving attractive investment returns.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not uncommon for fund managers to focus more on risk management than value enrichment â€” to the disadvantage of participants.\n\nRecent research from the Georgetown University Center for Retirement Initiatives, undertaken in partnership with the global advisory, broking and solutions firm Willis Towers Watson, shows that target-date funds can improve participant outcomes while managing risk better by expanding the use of alternative investment strategies like private equity, real estate, and hedge funds.\n\nThe analysis shows that by incorporating more diversifying asset classes, participants in target-date funds could see their annual retirement incomes improve by 11% to 17%, depending on market conditions.\n\nWith results like that, you might think that more diversified target-date funds would be the norm. However, a variety of considerations, including liquidity, pricing, benchmarking, fees, and governance, historically have held back fund managers and plan sponsors.\n\nDavid O'Meara, Head of DC Strategy at Willis Towers Watson, points out that there are solutions to these obstacles. Operational challenges, including the need for daily liquidity and daily pricing, and participant-controlled cash flows, can easily be addressed, he says.\n\nIn fact, a diversified portfolio that includes alternative asset classes can still have 71% to 76% of its assets available to satisfy daily liquidity, according to the Center for Retirement Initiative's research. That's more than enough to address any reasonable concerns investors may have. Moreover, as the popularity of target-date funds has increased over the past decade, flows have been markedly positive, further alleviating worries about liquidity challenges.\n\nSince investors have been conditioned to focus on fees, many fund managers have an almost myopic focus on keeping costs low. In fact, 95% of the $70 billion in net target-date fund flows in 2017 went to passively managed funds.\n\nWhile this may keep fees low, it may also impede investment returns by limiting the strategies and approaches that may be utilized within the funds.\n\nTo address America's retirement savings challenge, the target-date fund industry must strive to use all of levers available, including improving investment portfolio construction, to make investment returns more attractive. This should increase contributions while also boosting the availability of resources in retirement. Our study demonstrates how results can improve by better diversifying target-date fund portfolios.\n\nPolicy makers can also play a vital role in dealing with fears about fiduciary risk and litigation. These concerns should not be allowed to make it more difficult for today's workers to prepare for tomorrow's retirement.\n\nThe benefits of alternative asset classes don't end when a worker retires. Our research shows that a well-diversified target-date fund has a higher probability of maintaining retirement assets after 30 years of retirement spending. That means retirees can enjoy a better quality of life while depending less on government support.\n\nWhen many more Americans relied primarily on traditional defined benefit pension programs for their postwork years, there was less need to consider the integration of alternative asset classes in defined-contribution plans. As more of us take greater responsibility for our own retirement outcomes, the investment industry must be more responsive to the need for these asset classes to be part of defined-contribution plans.\n\nSimplified savings and investment programs like target-date funds make it easy for workers to contribute without having to actively manage their assets. Investors believe that by outsourcing the investment decision-making, they will get the best returns with the least risk. To truly accomplish this objective, though, maximizing that benefit requires better asset class diversification.\n\nFund managers already have the tools necessary to introduce these new asset classes to generate better rates of return and lower risk, while policy makers have the opportunity to take steps to make doing so even easier.\n\nIn addition to helping more workers access ways to save for retirement, another way to address America's retirement savings challenge is by making investing easy and decisions simple and providing the freedom to employ the same investment techniques already used by defined benefit pensions to generate strong returns.\n\nWell-diversified target-date funds have the potential to check all those boxes and improve retirement outcomes for millions of retirees.

Stocks in the U.K. closed lower Thursday as home-builder shares fell after a lackluster update on house prices, while Royal Mail PLC shares struggled following a trading update.\n\nThe FTSE 100 UKX, +0.25% lost 0.5% to end at 7,208.44, after rising 0.4% on Wednesday.\n\nBritish blue-chips remained in the red while the broader European equity market SXXP, +0.40% briefly turned positive after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank continues to stand ready to extend stimulus measures for the eurozone economy, if needed.\n\nRead Live Blog recap of Draghi's press conference\n\nIn London, a 6% drop dragged Royal Mail RMG, +1.58% shares to the bottom of the FTSE 100. The delivery company said U.K. sales declined 2% in the nine months to Dec. 25. But trading was in line with expectations, it said, as strong performance over Christmas helped counter those poor figures.\n\nMeanwhile, home-builder stocks lost ground after a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey found U.K. house-price growth slowed in December, for the first time since July.\n\nShares of Barratt Developments PLC BDEV, +1.51% and Taylor Wimpey UK:TW fell 2.1% and 1.3%, respectively, and Persimmon PLC PSN, -0.74% gave up 1%.\n\nMiners on the move: Mining shares were moving lower as most metals prices fell, with gold US:GCG7 down about 1% and silver US:SIH7 losing 2%. The moves for metals came as the dollar DXY, +0.41% rose, following Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's comment that the central bank expects a few interest rate hikes a year through the end of 2019. A strong buck can make dollar-denominated metals more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\nCopper miner Fresnillo PLC FRES, +1.38% fell 3.4%, Randgold Resources PLC UK:RRS GOLD, -1.28% lost 1%, and Anglo American PLC AAL, +2.29% shed 3.1%. But Antofagasta PLC ANTO, +3.31% was up 0.7%.\n\nShares of BHP Billiton PLC UK:BLT BHP, -2.32% BHP, -0.82% gave up 0.6%.

In our view, even a hint at 2018 tapering will not come before the summer, after the Dutch and French elections and the first possible impact of new U.S. economic policies.\n\nEarlier Thursday, British Prime Minister Theresa May told the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Britain is open for business to the world after last year's Brexit vote. She said the result of the referendum wasn't aimed at undermining the European Union, but voters wanted the country to have greater freedom to make sovereign decisions.\n\nRead:May urges businesses to 'play by the same rules' that ordinary workers follow
Growth has finally started to pick up globally, but there are still key risks on the horizon in 2017 that could shatter the newfound optimism in the world economy, warns Goldman Sachs's chief economist Jan Hatzius.\n\nSpeaking at conference in London on Monday, Hatzius noted that there has been an impressive acceleration of growth since the summer, taking the Wall Street bank's global growth forecast to an above-consensus 3.6% for this year.\n\nSee also: Goldman's Hatzius: 35% chance of Fed hike in March and markets aren't braced for it\n\nThe cheery estimate comes of the back of easing in financial conditions and looser fiscal policy, which should provide a much-needed boost particularly to developed economies, he said.\n\nHatzius, however, pointed to three major risks that could derail the upbeat outlook for the months ahead.\n\nRisk number one is associated with the transition to the Trump administration, a hard turn toward protectionism. That's certainly something we got our eye on that I think is a downside risk to the global economy, he said.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has already hinted at some aggressive trade tariffs, for example threatening Japanese car maker Toyota 7203, +4.12% with a big border tax if it builds a plant in Mexico for cars to the U.S. market. In the same vein, Ford F, -1.58% in a surprising turnaround last week said it's canceled plans for a $1.6 billion Mexico plant after facing criticism from Trump for more than a year.\n\nRisk number two is European politics, Hatzius said. While Europe has clearly improved, there's still some very significant problems, especially in the labor market of the southern European economies.\n\nThe unemployment rate in Spain, for example, is still almost 20%, while around 12% of people are without a job in Italy. Some political analysts fear there will be snap elections in Italy this year after Matteo Renzi resigned in December after losing a referendum on constitutional reforms. Other major political events this year in Europe include elections in France and Germany, as well as Brexit negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union.\n\nRead:Permabear Edwards: 'Waste of time' to save Italian banks\n\nAnd finally, for Hatzius's third key risk, he's looking further east.\n\nChina continues to see very rapid debt growth and increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio, so we will take a close look at signals from China. Especially as far as capital flows are concerned and this a major focus of our Asia economics team, he said and pointed to the charts below:
The U.S. dollar rebounded from an initial dip against its rivals following the December jobs report, but still registered its third consecutive weekly loss. The employment report came in below expectations and showed that wage growth remained sluggish, turning the greenback negative before it bounced back.\n\nThe data could lead analysts to reassess their expectation for interest rate increases in 2018, which the Federal Reserve put at three.\n\nWhat are currencies doing?\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.03% was last 0.1% higher at 91.975, while the broader WSJ U.S. Dollar Index BUXX, +0.05% was up 0.1% at 85.67. The ICE index is on track to post a 0.2% decline in this first week of 2018, continuing the downward trend of the last two weeks of the old year, according to FactSet. The WSJ index slipped 0.4% on the week.\n\nElsewhere in North America, the Canadian dollar USDCAD, +0.06% rallied against its U.S. counterpart. The buck last bought C$ 1.2412, its lowest level since September, compared with C$1.2487 late Thursday. On the week, the loonie, as the Canadian currency is also called, jumped 1.3% against the buck.\n\nSee:Bank of Canada interest-rate-hike expectations for January soar after jobs data\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.03% was down at $1.2039 from $1.2068 late Thursday in New York, after briefly trading in positive territory. Still, on the week, the euro is on track for a 0.3% gain. On Thursday, the shared currency traded at its highest level since January 2015, but was unable to defend its gains even in the face of supportive inflation data.\n\nRead:What's next for the euro in 2018?

The U.S. added only 148,000 jobs in December, compared with the MarketWatch consensus forecast of 195,000. Wages grew by 2.5% in the 12 months leading up to December, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. Wages are also used as a gauge for inflation, which has been stubbornly low.\n\nAnalysts, as well as central bankers, continue to grapple with the U.S. economy, which is close to full employment and expanding, while wages remain subdued.\n\nThe minutes from the December Federal Reserve meeting out earlier this week showed policy makers were relatively upbeat on the outlook for the U.S. economy, but still worried about the persistently low inflation levels.\n\nThe Fed penciled in three rate increases in 2018, but market participants are beginning to take this number with a grain of salt. Earlier in the session, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker shared his expectation of only two interest rate increases in 2018.\n\nElsewhere, a soft December inflation report was weighing on the euro and posed some risk for those betting on strengthening of the shared currency. The December flash reading of harmonized eurozone CPI was 1.4%, in line with estimates, but below the previous month's 1.5% reading. Core inflation slowed to 0.9% across the eurozone, falling below the FactSet consensus of 1%, but remaining in line with the November figure.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\nThe headline number was weaker and the revisions weren't great, Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said of the jobs report and the lower wage growth number. The Phillips curve is still missing in action. But I think to say that the Fed made a policy error in December is too strong. For all its weakness, the report was still far from catastrophe.\n\nThe Phillips curve describes the historically inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation.\n\nWith annualized CPI in December at 1.4% there is still clearly some way to go before monetary policy can start to normalize, even though core CPI [â€¦] is up 1.1%, Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online platform Infinox, said of the eurozone inflation data. Not even the ECB expects inflation to return to target this year, but if signs are that it is on course to do so [â€¦] the end of quantitative easing in September looks likely.\n\nWhat are the data?\n\nThe unemployment rate stood at 4.1% in December, in line with the MarketWatch consensus forecast. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% in the same month, in line with the estimate.\n\nThe foreign trade deficit widened to $50.5 billion in November, rising from $48.7 billion to its highest since January 2012.\n\nThe ISM nonmanucturing index showed declined to 55.9 in December, compared with a consensus expectation of 57.7. A reading of 50 or better indicates expanding activity.\n\nFactory orders for November grew by 1.3%, beating estimates of 1.1% and the previous month's 0.4% growth.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada also reported employment figures, with the Labor Force Survey jumping to 78,600, beating the consensus of a 12,500 decline in December. The unemployment rate fell to 5.7% from 5.9%.
Treasurys saw choppy price action Wednesday but ended little changed, leaving yields largely steady after the Federal Reserve underlined rising inflation expectations and did nothing to discourage expectations it will tighten monetary policy when it meets in March.\n\nYields, which move inversely to debt prices, initially crept higher after the Fed released its policy statement, then pulled back. The two-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , the most sensitive to changes to monetary policy, rose just 0.18 basis points to 2.142%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% was little budged on the day at 2.722%, after earlier testing levels last seen in April 2014.\n\nThe 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% , however, retreated 0.37 basis points to 2.944%. All three maturities saw the biggest monthly yield rise since November 2016.\n\nWhat is driving the market?\n\nIn the last meeting headed by Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who will hand the reins to Jerome Powell on Feb. 3, the Fed signaled it is on track to raise rates at its next meeting in March after policy makers decided unanimously to leave the fed-funds rate unchanged in a range of 1.25% to 1.5%. The policy statement was read as relatively hawkish, asserting that inflation would pick up in coming months.\n\nEarlier, payroll-processing firm ADP said the U.S. economy added 234,000 private-sector jobs in January versus expectations by economists for 185,000. Traders look to the data for clues to official jobs data, though economists note the ADP figures have a mixed record in anticipating the private-sector portion of the Labor Department jobs tally.\n\nThe Treasury Department said it plans to increase the size of this quarter's bond and note auctions by $42 billion to meet increased funding needs. Treasury said that it would only be able to fund the government through the end of February unless Congress raises the debt ceiling. Treasury will increase the size of two-year and three-year note auctions by $2 billion a month this quarter. In addition, Treasury will increase the auction sizes to each of the next offerings of five-year, seven-year, 10-year notes and the 30-year bond auctions starting in February.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\nThe changes to the statement were fairly modest, but the markets didn't really need much further encouragement. Fed-funds futures have risen almost continuously since last September and, at this stage, a March rate increase is pretty much fully priced in, said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note.\n\nThe debt limit continues to constrain Treasury's flexibility in financing and they urge Congress to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible. Treasury continues to expect that they can fund the government through the end of January. The increases in coupon supply will eat into available borrowing authority and will further limit bill issuance until the debt ceiling is raised, said Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies, in a note.\n\nWhat other data are in focus?
President-elect Donald Trump on Monday criticized North Korea and China in two Twitter posts, again using the social-media platform to shape his foreign-policy message.\n\nIn his first tweet, Trump remarked on news over the weekend that North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un said his government was completing preparations for a test launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which could be the next stage in developing a nuclear weapon that could strike parts of the U.S.
Thud! That's the sound of global stock markets falling out of bed as the new year gets under way.\n\nTriggered by China's weak manufacturing data, plunging stock market SHCOMP, +0.51% and falling yuan USDCNY, +0.07% , equity markets across the globe slumped in sympathy. China introduced, activated and suspended a new stock market circuit breaker â€” all in the first four trading sessions of the new year.\n\nU.S. crude oil prices CLG26, +0.10% touched a 12-year low on Thursday. Developing nations, having borrowed heavily in U.S. dollars, now face an additional debt-service burden because of the dollar's DXY, +0.40% multi-year appreciation. The World Bank lowered its global growth forecast to 2.9% for 2016, warning of spillover effects from a simultaneous slowdown in several of the largest emerging markets.\n\nThe volume of global trade has slowed dramatically after a 13% post-recession bounce in 2010. Both revenue and operating earnings for S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% companies are expected to decline in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to Bianco Research.\n\nOne of the few bright spots for the U.S. economy remains the employment situation. Friday's jobs report for December showed a 292,000 increase in non-farm payrolls, a combined upward revision of 50,0000 to October and November, and an unemployment rate steady at 5%, the cycle low.\n\nYet even with solid hiring, the R word has started to creep into polite conversation, mostly as a question â€” could it happen here? â€” rather than a definitive forecast. However, a few economists are predicting recession this year, including David Levy, chairman of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center, who told CBS News that the next road to recession is likely to pass through Beijing.\n\nSo how likely or imminent is a U.S. recession? Not very. It's possible that an out-of-nowhere shock could tip a slow-growing economy into negative territory. But real recession, not just an arithmetic decline in real gross domestic product, such as the ones that occurred in the first quarter of 2011 and 2015, requires some heavy lifting.\n\nFor starters, let's dispense with the myth that expansions die of old age. Expansions die because the central bank kills them.\n\nNot intentionally, of course. The typical pattern for the post-war business cycle went something like this.\n\n1. An expanding economy tests the limits of its productive capacity and starts to generate inflationary pressure.\n\n2. The central bank raises its benchmark rate to curtail inflation.\n\n3. The central bank overstays its welcome, the economy tips into recession, inflation recedes.\n\n4. The central bank lowers interest rates, the economy bounces back. The entire cycle repeats itself.\n\nA financial crisis accompanying a recession introduces a new prototype and limits the effectiveness of the traditional cure. Once a boom goes bust, monetary and fiscal policy become less effective because of necessary deleveraging, even though ultra-low interest rates are an incentive to borrow and spend. The pattern of a deep recession followed by a sharp, swift rebound becomes inoperative, as the subdued recovery from the 2007-2009 recession made clear.\n\nIn the interim, bank balance sheets have been repaired. And regulators have imposed higher capital requirements to prevent loan losses in a particular asset class from infecting the entire financial system.\n\nThe Federal Reserve seems intent on raising interest rates four times this year. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer reiterated that forecast Thursday, the same day the minutes from the Dec. 15-16 meeting were released, revealing policy makers' concern about the persistence of below-target inflation.\n\nIf the Fed sticks to its projected rate increases in the face of stable or declining long-term rates, the recession forecast becomes a real possibility. As I explained in my Dec. 23 MarketWatch column, a failure of long rates to cooperate could upend the Fed's best-laid plans. The yield curve could invert this time at exceptionally low levels. And an inverted yield curve, with the benchmark rate higher than the long rate, has been a reliable harbinger of recession.\n\nI won't go into the dynamics of the yield curve again, other than to say that the spread is an inducement for banks to create credit. Invert the curve and that incentive disappears.\n\nThe consumer seems to be the main driver of the U.S. economy, which saw record auto sales in 2015. Consumer spending has slowed on a year-over-year basis, and a significant deterioration in financial markets, should it persist, could dampen discretionary spending.\n\nBut a recession? Not likely. For that to happen, the Fed would have to get to work raising interest rates and ignore the market's response, as it has in the past. The SEC requires mutual funds to tell investors that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. In the case of the Fed, let's hope it's not.
Gold futures settled with a loss of more than 2% on Wednesday as a jump in U.S. bond yields undercut the competitive advantage of owning risk-free Treasuries over bullion.\n\nRising long-term Treasury yields are a negative headwind for gold, said Michael Armbruster, managing partner at Altavest. If the 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise, gold is likely to move lower.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y hit a peak near 1.06%, marking its highest level since March. Higher yields can undercut appetite for safe-haven gold, which doesn't offer a coupon.\n\nThe runoff elections for the U.S. Senate in Georgia have been closely watched Wednesday and if the Democrats sweep the state, that will likely put further upward pressure on Treasury yields, soâ€¦gold could move lower in the short run even if the U.S. dollar index continues to weaken, Armbruster told MarketWatch.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, February gold GCH21, +1.10% GC00, +1.14% lost $45.80, or 2.3%, to settle at $1,908.60 an ounce, after hitting an intraday high of $1,962.50.\n\nPrices edged up to $1,912.40 in electronic trading Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting.\n\nSilver for March SIH21, +2.14% shed 60 cents, or 2.2%, meanwhile, to end at $27.042 an ounce.\n\nThe slump for gold comes after it touched a two-month high Tuesday amid the reports on the Georgia political races.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields rose overnight after early vote counts suggested that Democrats were on track to win both U.S. Senate seats in Georgia and thus control of Congress, an outcome that gives President-elect Joe Biden administration more room to roll out more debt to achieve his policy agendas.\n\nDemocrats may take the Senate after Raphael Warnock won one of two Senate runoffs in Georgia early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, bringing Democrats a seat closer to a Senate majority. Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff was leading Republican Sen. David Perdue also.\n\nWith control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.\n\nAt some point, the Federal Reserve will not tolerate rising Treasury rates and will implement their yield curve control policy framework, Armbruster said. If the Fed ever announces a Yield Curve Control policy, that would be massively bullish for gold.\n\nMarket participants also attributed some of gold's slide on Wednesday to investors consolidating some of their overnight gains.\n\nGold and silver futures prices are lower on some normal profit taking from the shorter-term futures traders and some chart consolidation after gold hit a two-month high overnight and silver scored a four-month high, wrote Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco.com, in a daily research note.\n\nTechnically, the February gold futures bulls have the firm overall near-term technical advantage amid a price uptrend in place on the daily bar chart, he wrote.\n\nBulls' next upside price objective is to produce a close in February futures above solid resistance at the November high of $1,973.30, the strategist wrote, adding that the bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $1,900.\n\nGold prices also moved lower even as data on U.S. private sector employment fell in December, shedding 123,000 jobs to mark the first decline since April, according to the ADP National Employment Report.\n\nRounding out action on Comex Wednesday, March copper HGH21, -0.22% added 0.3% to $3.6505 a pound to mark another settlement at the highest price for a most-active contract since February 2013.\n\nCopper has been supported in part by fresh supply fears surfacing in Peru that have resulted in blocked shipments from a mine involved in the labor dispute, according to analysts at Zaner Metals.
In a speech focused more on the broader economy than immediate interest-rate policy, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin told an audience in Raleigh, N.C., that the future growth of the labor force may depend on people currently on the sidelines. Barkin said opportunities to grow the workforce include policies to support women's labor force participation, workforce development and legal immigration. The former McKinsey consultant suggested that business underinvestment and declining startup rates were a reason for lagging productivity growth. He said he forecasts growth to be somewhat slower in 2019 than 2018.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren has been concerned about a potential asset bubble in commercial real estate since late 2015. And he says that the problem of asset prices has gotten worse, not better.\n\nFor a while, real estate looked like the only asset class that was showing signs of having substantial variation from what the average valuation had been, but I think we're starting to see more asset markets have that characteristic, he says.\n\nThis makes life hard for the central bank. For instance, it makes it more difficult for the central bank to engineer a soft landing for the economy, Rosengren said. It also means the Fed cannot pause in its gradual pace of rate hikes and should even pick up the pace a bit this year. The U.S. central bank might have to raise rates four times in 2018, he said, more than the median forecast of Fed officials or the two hikes the market expects.\n\nMarketWatch spoke with Rosengren as he was preparing to give his first speech of the year on the economic outlook. In his remarks, he said low inflation has so far allowed the Fed to pursue very gradual rate hikes.\n\nHere's the edited interview.\n\nMarketWatch: Asset valuations have continued to rise after you last voiced concern last year. What's your latest view?\n\nRosengren: Nothing has changed dramatically, prices are still edging up, so valuation concerns are still there. I would say what has changed a little bit is, for a while, real estate looked like the only asset class that was showing signs of having substantial variation from what the average valuation had been, but I think we're starting to see more asset markets have that characteristic.\n\nEconomists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. And there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. One would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. That means valuations, will, on average, be higher. So the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? And obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. So those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. But I would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.\n\nMarketWatch: The Fed's rate hikes to date haven't tightened financial conditions at all.\n\nRosengren: That's accurate. Financial conditions have not tightened significantly with the increase in short-term interest rates. Part of that is the stock market has gone up quite a bit and exchange rates and some of these other variables are being affected by a stimulative fiscal policy. So even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. And now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% is a little less than 2.5% right now. I would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.\n\nMarketWatch: Do you think the Fed should raise rates at a faster pace than gradual?\n\nRosengren: The [Fed forecasts] in December had three tightenings. I actually think we'll probably need a little bit more than that. I'm hopeful that we can continue to do it gradually. Doing it gradually probably requires us to continue to be doing it though. So if we were to slow down for some reason, I would be worried that at some point we would have to start moving more quickly. I would be worried about moving quickly at a time when asset prices were already at very high valuations. I think being able to do it more leisurely is one reason why we haven't had as much of a slowdown and probably has reduced the probability of having a recession. In addition, fiscal policy being so stimulative is a period where you wouldn't expect an economic downturn either.\n\nMarketWatch: Is the Fed, in a sense, going to keep raising rates until it sees a tightening of financial conditions?\n\nRosengren: No, I wouldn't phrase it that way. Our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. The unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. My own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. If you look at the Blue Chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. So we are actually moving in the opposite direction. I do think that we have to gradually tighten and I don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.\n\nAnd I would put financial conditions â€“ that is not a goal of monetary policy â€“ but it makes it harder to start tightening if you have to do a lot of tightening, and if you really have to slow down the economy. If you think that potential GDP is growing around 1.75%, well if you want to get the unemployment rate to gradually go up, you are going to have to be seeing some 1.5% [GDP prints] and some lower numbers than we've been seeing. When we see those numbers it is possible that you get more of a slowdown than you're anticipating, and that can be particularly true, I think, if financial markets are a little bit too ebullient. So I think financial conditions and financial stability issues complement some of the concerns I would have about whether we're getting to an unsustainable level of unemployment rate over time.\n\nMarketWatch: Some colleagues want the pace of rate hikes to slow down â€“ and point to the flattening of the yield curve as a signal to go slow.\n\nRosengren: We've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. We've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. Until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the U.S. is doing, it is what Japan and Europe are doing. So they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.\n\nIt isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. We haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework â€” which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. I'm not advocating that. But I think it is an intentional policy. It is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.\n\nMarketWatch: And you think that inflation will move higher?\n\nRosengren: Just having the data from the spring time roll off â€“ we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that I think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so I think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. In addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. If we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. You're already hearing lots of stories, I think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. These things take time. They don't happen overnight. That's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. I do expect that over time it will have that impact. We'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.\n\nMarketWatch: There has been a lot of discussion in recent weeks about a new framework for monetary policy. Where do you stand?\n\nRosengren: I think there are some advantages of having a Fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range â€“ something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is â€“ and it is partly a financial stability concern â€“ that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences â€“ both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability. Inflation would still be, I think, in a range that it wouldn't be affecting decision-making by households or firms but would give you a little more flexibility to reduce the probability that you hit zero during recessions. So if we were to have a recession right now, most recessions we move interest rates by much more than 300 basis points. If you look at where the [Fed forecasts] in December had the fed funds in the long run, [2.8%] it is low enough that more than likely in most recessions we'd hit zero. That is a concern.
U.S. stocks on Tuesday started the first trading day of 2017 on a positive note but closed off of intraday highs as oil prices turned sharply lower, puncturing some of the initial exuberance that underpinned an early rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.46% rose 119.16 points, or 0.6%, to close at 19,881.76. The blue-chip index had gained as much as 176 points at one point during the session. Nike Inc. NKE, -1.14% and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +1.00% were among the biggest gainers while Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, -0.69% , and McDonald's Corp. MCD, -0.54% were notable laggards.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% also finished off its best levels, adding 19 points, or 0.9%, to end at 2,257.83. The index had been up as much as 25 points in early morning action. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% climbed 45.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at 5,429.08.\n\nStocks started with a bit of a rally as the market tried to make up for some of the losses from last week, said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading.\n\nHowever, the strong start out of the gate soon fizzled as oil turned weak. Crude futures CLG27, fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect.\n\nThe choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market.\n\nOnce you get closer to 20,000, historically it's been hard to get through on the first pass, said Kepner.\n\nStill, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion's share of the market's postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth.\n\nThat thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits.\n\nThere are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump's policies don't come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising, said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was fairly optimistic about U.S. stocks.\n\nRead:Stock-market bulls wary of new-year hangover\n\nIn addition to Trump's policies, investors will be monitoring the president-elect's Twitter feed, which he has used to take shots at specific companies. On Tuesday, he criticized General Motors Co. GM, -1.30% in a tweet, writing that the company is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax! While the stock fell in premarket trading, it subsequently turned higher, rising 0.9%.\n\nThe tweet followed similar statements against Boeing Co. BA, -2.86% and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +2.12%\n\nTrump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers, said Andersen. We're getting surgical precision when it comes to commentary on specific companies, but we're still getting our sea legs with how to interpret this data. It could be more symbolic than concrete in its meaning, but we don't know. We're in a steep learning curve with him.\n\nIn other company news, Xerox Corp. XRX, -4.69% jumped 20% after Credit Suisse upgraded the company to outperform.\n\nWhat Trump's North Korea tweets mean\n\nOther markets: Equities rose across the globe, with Asian markets higher after encouraging Chinese manufacturing data and European stocks building on their gains from Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the New Year's holiday.\n\nA key dollar index DXY, +0.41% traded 1% higher while gold futures US:GCG7 settled up 0.9%.\n\nEconomic news: In the latest economic data, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index climbed to 54.7% in December from 53.2%. The reading was higher than expected, and the highest level in two years. Separately, a read on construction spending rose 0.9% in November, above expectations and the sixth increase of the past seven months.\n\nCheck out:MarketWatch's Economic Calendar\n\nâ€”Victor Reklaitis contributed to this article.
The Federal Reserve appears to have succeeded where other central banks have failed â€” at least in convincing markets that it will be more dovish in the years ahead, said former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Sunday.\n\nAs best we can tell, the Fed's forward guidance â€” both in terms of its change in its framework and in terms of its commitments â€” have been fairly effective, Bernanke said, during a discussion about economic policy during the coronavirus pandemic at the American Economics Association's annual meeting.\n\nCentral banks often face the challenge of being credible about policy decisions that won't be made for years, but the Fed seems to have accomplished this goal, Bernanke said.\n\nIn August, the Fed announced a new policy framework, saying that it will attempt to overshoot its 2% inflation target, after years of undershooting that target.\n\nThe Fed also said it would no longer preemptively hike its benchmark interest rate to ward off expected inflation, which had been standard Fed policy going back to the 1950s. Under the new commitment, the Fed won't move until it actually sees rising inflation.\n\nSurveys of primary dealers conducted by the New York Fed indicate that market participants broadly believe the Fed has moved in a dovish direction and that inflation will be higher and unemployment will be lower when the Fed lifts its benchmark rate off zero, Bernanke noted.\n\nWhen the economy is slowly recovering from a deep recession, markets often look ahead and bond yields rise. But this spike in long-term bond yields can cause growth to stall out. This dynamic was a constant struggle for Bernake in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008.\n\nMarket expectations today are much more dovish than after the 2008 financial crisis, Bernanke noted.\n\nFinancial markets don't see rates being increased for something like four years, he said.\n\nBernanke said the Fed's monetary policy has had beneficial effects since the pandemic started wreaking havoc on the economy in March.\n\nThe economic recovery has proven to be faster than expected, he noted. In June, the Fed expected 2020 GDP growth would be minus-6.5% on a year-over-year basis. Now, the Fed expects it will be less than minus-2%.\n\nIn addition, the sectors that are impacted by low interest rates have led the recovery.\n\nBernanke said the Fed was also successful in restoring markets in the wake of the short, sharp financial crisis in early March when the economic impact of the coming pandemic became understood.\n\nBernanke said the Fed's Main Street lending facility was a notable exception and was less successful. The alternative funding for lending approach taken by many foreign central banks seemed more successful. Those plans provide very cheap funding to any marginal lending done by banks.\n\nThose programs, particularly in Europe, have been extremely successful in getting money out the door, he said.
CHICAGO (MarketWatch) â€” Economic conditions are likely to call for two interest-rate hikes in 2017, but a forecast of three hikes is not implausible, said Chicago Fed President Charles Evans on Friday.\n\nIn remarks to reporters after a speech to economists, Evans said he was sticking with expectation of two rate hikes that he made in September even though things are now a little bit stronger than they were then.\n\nEvans is one of the more dovish Fed officials. He is a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year.\n\nThe Chicago Fed president said he expects 2-2.5% real GDP growth this year and unemployment would continue to decline. Expected fiscal stimulus makes him more confident in this forecast, he said.\n\nInflation should begin to move up, but there is still a ways to go to get to the central bank's 2% target.\n\nThings are moving in the right direction, Evans said.\n\nThe outlook for the path of interest rates should become clearer as the year progresses.\n\nThe new Trump administration faces a host of economic policy decisions on what should be announced, decided and executed on.\n\nThere is a lot to be wondering about, Evans said.\n\nThe new administration's policies must focus on increasing the labor supply and boosting productivity if it wants to achieve a 3% or higher rate of growth, he said.\n\nOther policies may lead to a short-term burst of growth but will not be sustainable because they will be inflationary, he said.\n\nEvans said there has been a shift in the economy that make communicating about policy more difficult.\n\nThings are changing obviously, he said. After years of slow recovery and weak inflation, unemployment is at 4.7%, near many estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment below which might spark inflation.\n\nEvans said he didn't expect there was going to be an inflation surge right away because the relationship between low unemployment and inflation, seen in the Phillips curve, was flat.\n\nBut we have a lot of accommodation in play. If real interest rates start to move up and if other things start to move up inflation may rise, he said.\n\nSo it becomes more complicated because the path is looking a little bit different than it did the last few years, he said.
As we enter the new year it's a good time to reflect on major life changes that may have occurred for you and your family during the past year.\n\nChanges like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property. Any one of these events could trigger the need to revise your estate plan by making adjustments to your will or creating an amendment to your trust or reassigning beneficiary(s); both primary and contingent.
Democrats' apparent sweep in the Georgia Senate runoffs means they can dust off some of the lofty legislative plans for 2021 they made before the November election, but experts say they should temper their expectations.\n\nAssuming Jon Ossoff's lead over Sen. David Perdue holds up, Democrats will hold sway over the 50-50 split Senate once Vice President-elect Kamala Harris takes office Jan. 20 to cast tie-breaking votes in the chamber.\n\nIn the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi will lead a shrunken Democratic caucus that will have the smallest majority in years.\n\nThose factors mean Democrats will have a narrow path to write legislation that will please a resurgent liberal wing, leave moderates who took the worst losses in the last election mollified, and still be substantive.\n\nWhat's the issue? And then, depending on the issue, the question is whether you're going to lose Democrats, said Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\n\nRelated: Warnock projected winner, while Ossoff clings to slim lead in second Georgia race\n\nIn the short term, the sweep means another round of economic stimulus to offset the effects of the coronavirus is likely to come sooner and be bigger than otherwise. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they would expect about $600 billion more in stimulus under a Democratic Congress, for example.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer signaled in a statement on Wednesday that he expected more COVID-19 aid would be coming.\n\nIt feels like a brand new day, the New York lawmaker said. For too long, much-needed help has been stalled or diluted by a Republican-led Senate and President Trump. That will change with a Democratic Senate, Democratic House, and a Democratic President.\n\nLong-term, given the filibuster and a united Republican front, other priorities, like immigration, climate change and infrastructure, will face an uphill climb.\n\nStill, winning the Senate has its perks â€” Schumer would set the legislative agenda, hold committee hearings and exercise oversight of federal agencies.\n\nCertainly there are advantages to holding the Senate majority â€”Democrats would chair Senate committees, set the agenda, and a Democratic Majority Leader could help confirm Biden administration nominees, wrote Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist for Stifel Nicolaus & Co., in a note.\n\nHowever, the difference between a 50-50 Senate and a 51-49 Senate on the ability to pass legislation is small.\n\nRepublicans would still be able to use the filibuster to block major legislation, meaning 60 votes would be needed to move a bill forward and the narrow margin will continually tempt Democratic senators to demand concessions from leadership in return for their vote.\n\nThat narrow margin could also incentivize bipartisanship, though. Already, a small bipartisan group of senators, working with a similar group in the House called the Problem Solvers Caucus, played a major role in developing the second big coronavirus aid package. It also called for senators to refrain from challenging the Electoral College results when the votes were presented to Congress.\n\nThe bipartisan group showed in the lame duck that just by demonstrating what is viable at the 60-vote threshold, they can exert significant leverage, said Liam Donovan, principal with Bracewell LLP's Policy Resolution Group.\n\nI don't think that's going to be replicable on a regular basis, but if you're Biden you look to that group as your legislative litmus test, and the GOP rump you can conceivably work with even if the Leader needs convincing.\n\nManley was a bit more wary.\n\nThese groups, at least in recent years, don't have a good track record. They keep getting marginalized in the end, he said.\n\nOne major consequence of a Democratic Senate would be the nominees the Biden administration sends to Capitol Hill for confirmation. Faced with the threat of Democratic filibusters, Senate Republicans during the Trump administration turned to filling the federal judicial ranks with judges they hoped would be friendly to conservative causes.\n\nA simple majority allows Biden to move his nominees far more quickly, easily, and with a far broader pool of talent to choose from, Donovan said.\n\nHaving the Senate would also allow Democrats to push through some types of legislation with a simple majority, using an optional process called budget reconciliation. While reconciliation bills are filibuster-proof, they are subject to strict requirements on subject matter and budgetary impact.\n\nRelated: Biden could use GOP trick to open door to 'big things' in 2021\n\nWhile reconciliation could be powerful tool â€” especially if Democrats use it twice in one year, as Republicans did in 2017 â€” the narrow margins in both chambers mean leaders will have to thread the needle in writing bills. Repealing some of the 2017 tax cuts would meet the rules and have broad Democratic support, for example, while the Green New Deal would likely have a tougher time on both counts.\n\nIt depends on the issue, but in a very narrowly held Senate, I don't think it's a given, Manley said.\n\nHighlighting the potential ideological difficulties, Donovan said reconciliation would allow Democrats to within the strictures of the process, move anything that Bernie Sanders and Joe Manchin can agree on.
With the average lifespan of the human race expanding more than ever due to health care advances, it's not unlikely that people will be retired for 20 or even 30 years. Retirement itself is as much a journey as the journey it took to get there.\n\nHere are five steps to take to make sure you put the glow on the golden years.\n\nTake charge of your financial buckets\n\nIf you're going to be living off your savings for 20 years, it's imperative to make sure all the parts fit together. What do you have and what changes need to be made? The sooner you reconnect with all of your assets and liabilities, the easier it will be to make decisions as you move from the accumulation phase to the distribution phase of life.\n\nFor example, a cash value life insurance policy that you purchased 20 years ago when you had young children, may no longer be a good fit for you. What options do you have for using it in retirement? Can you take loans, or should you cash it in? What are the tax consequences?\n\nHow do you maximize what you can get from Social Security? There are over 500 different ways to take it.\n\nDon't leave these questions for the last minute. Consult a financial advisor with experience working with retirees or pre-retirees.\n\nBuild your social resiliency\n\nSocial isolation is being recognized as equal to or greater than physical health problems such as obesity or heart conditions. Not going to work every day can make for quite a lonely existence. How will you stay engaged with people you care about or the community at large? Do you want to take classes? Do you want to volunteer?\n\nMany times, people find themselves getting away from something. I can't wait until I don't have to deal with ____. Let's put a positive spin on it and create a healthy outlook. What do you want to retire to, or rewire for? What type of people do you want to be around? How can you start creating those social support structures ahead of time?\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nDrill down on mindsets around cash flow\n\nYou are approaching the distribution season of your cycle. There is a psychological shift that takes place when you are no longer working for the money that comes into your life.\n\nYou will now be getting a paycheck from the fruits of your labor in the form of distributions from investments. It may be taking equity out of your home in the form of a sale and downsizing, or taking out a reverse mortgage. It could be the sale of a business or creating a charitable remainder trust to minimize taxable gain and create an income stream. You could be starting to withdraw from a pension such as PERA or from former employer.\n\nRead: 5 ways life could change for retirees in 2018\n\nBringing money into your life with integrity, competency, dignity, grace and joy is foundational to financial health. It is good to reflect on, discuss and deal with what changes are coming, rather than have emotions blindside you when you cross that retirement line in the sand.\n\nMinimize debt\n\nA study done by the Michigan Retirement Research Center found that Americans between the ages of 56 and 61 are carrying more debt than any time in recent history. Is it your own spending choices or the decision to co-sign on a child's student loan that is weighing you down?\n\nRead: Why debt can be so dangerous in retirement\n\nSet to task to be out of debt before you start taking Social Security. If you owe money on a student loan (yours or someone you co-signed for), the government can shave off up to 15%, provided your remaining monthly benefit doesn't drop lower than $750. You do not want to be paying consumer debt that carries higher interest rates than your long-term investment accounts.\n\nEmbrace the impending season\n\nOur culture tells us to fight aging. What if we start cultivating the integrity and dignity inherent in elderhood? Picture your days. Find that balance between vacation and vocation. What do you enjoy about your days? How do you picture yourself replicating the parts that challenge you and keep you engaged? What will fill your days in meaningful ways? What are the financial implications of your vision?\n\nMany times, our identity is tied very closely with what we do to earn a living. You are more than a gerbil on a wheel. We need to welcome this opportunity to polish a new facet of our identity. As we ebb toward a new season of life, we need to remember that like a mighty oak, we are the same tree, our leaves are just changing color.\n\nI'm giving away a free copy of my book on this topic to anyone within five years of retirement.Send me an emailif you're interested.\n\nDanielle Howard is a Certified Financial Planner, speaker and author of Your Financial Revolution â€“ Time to Recognize, Revitalize, and Release Your Financial Power.

Kara Stein, the departing commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told MarketWatch she was focused during her five-and-a-half years as a regulator on bringing the regulator into the digital age.\n\nHer efforts have paid off with initiatives like the consolidated audit trail that she says will make a computerized marketplace more resilient to shocks. In the August 2010 Flash Crash, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 1,000 points in just seconds and then recovered almost as quickly.\n\nStein kept an eye on foundational issues to make sure markets stay fair and orderly since, At the end of the day, we're going to be regulating computers with computers.\n\nStein, a Democrat, joined the SEC after serving as Senior Policy Advisor for securities and banking matters for Rhode Island senator Jack Reed. As staff director of the Securities, Insurance, and Investment Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs from 2009 to 2013, she played a key role in drafting and negotiating significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank law.\n\nHer departure leaves one lone Democrat at the SEC, former law school professor Robert Jackson. The White House hasn't formally nominated her successor but the Wall Street Journal reported in August that the White House was vetting Allison H. Lee for the role. Lee is a corporate governance consultant, according to her LinkedIn profile, and worked at the SEC as a legal adviser to Stein from 2013 to 2015.\n\nStein says she will be a senior research fellow at the Center on Innovation at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, and will also be teaching a seminar starting soon at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nMarketWatch sat down with Stein on December 19 after her final open meeting, and right after colleagues delivered heartfelt salutes to her public service. Her last day at the SEC was January 2.\n\nMarketWatch: How do you feel?\n\nStein: I've been getting teary.\n\nMarketWatch: Is there a particular issue you feel you made the most progress on during your tenure or that you are the most proud of?\n\nStein: People might think it's boring, but I really cared immensely about updating the technology of the SEC, getting people to submit documents and other filings in structured form. I hope that makes it easier for folks to come to the site and compare one mutual fund to another or one issuer to another. When we regulate markets we really do regulate technology companies now.\n\nNow that the SEC is moving forward with the consolidated audit trail it will be easier to analyze what happened when we have an event like a flash crash instead of taking three months. Then we can figure out if it was limit up/limit down or circuit breakers and be able to do much faster analysis. The goal is to create much better remedies in the computerized marketplace, to make it more resilient. Because at the end of the day we're going to be regulating computers with computers.\n\nRead:Critics say SEC's audit trail plan falls short\n\nStein: These are foundational issues to being a regulator in 2018 going forward. It's something I feel is important but it was more about the SEC becoming part of the digital age.\n\nI think I have been really focused on conduct and accountability, trying to make sure the consequences of certain actions are clear and fair, making sure we are using all the tools we have in our toolbox effectively. I am talking, of course, about automatic disqualifications.\n\n[ At the Dec. 19 open meeting the SEC passed a rule over Stein's 'no' vote that she said in a statement will provide an automatic exception for a company that committed fraud, or engaged in the wholesale theft of assets and allow it to continue to participate in the securities swap market. There will be no application for a waiver, no hearing, no weighing of the factors, and no affirmative decision by the Commission. Companies will be automatically cleansed and be considered good actors in one procedure-less swoop.]\n\nIf we have these automatic disqualifications because someone has committed a crime or fraud, we should have a very thoughtful process before we say you can participate in the market again.\n\nWe should not have automatic waivers. So I have been pushing for a thoughtful process where we weigh the factors, we outline the factors required to show that it's in the public interest to allow that person to continue to participate in the marketplace. I have been focusing on the transparency around processes like that.\n\nRead:SEC commissioner calls for greater transparency in stock market\n\nRead also:Split at SEC means swaps waiver rule likely to get big alteration\n\nAs you know, I have been pushing for five and a half years on gatekeepers related to Stanley Sporkin's access theory, where attorneys, accountants and others who provide offerings with access to the marketplace are held strictly accountable for their own participation in such unlawful activities.\n\nAs a commissioner you are sitting in enforcement meetings every week and seeing the worst behavior in the market. With limited resources you have to figure out how to message the marketplace that certain behaviors are unacceptable. Again, we have to use all the tools and that includes penalties and disgorgement and bad actor bars.\n\nAnother thing I focused on, another geeky thing, is market infrastructure. It's aligned with my focus on technology. Making sure our markets are fair and orderly in this very high-speed marketplace.\n\nAs all of our trading venues are essentially computerized and interacting with each other at light speed it's changed the way we need to think about regulating the market. A lot of our rules were written for human beings. That might be a trader or an investment advisor. A mutual fund is a computer program.\n\nAlso read: SEC's Stein worried mutual funds marketing more risk to investors\n\nMarketWatch: I wrote the story, you may have seen, about how Chairman Clayton said, maybe when pressed recently by Senator Elizabeth Warren about whether the SEC's best interest rule proposal could be revised to use the word fiduciary. Do you think it might happen?\n\nStein: It's going to happen when I am not here. We have to think through what fiduciary duty means in the 21st century.\n\nI always say to my staff I am trying to make what we do clearer to the audience, to get rid of the technical stuff when I talk, since media translates it even further. People get very lawyerly around here, more than getting to be like the accountants, and missing the underlying important principles.\n\nWe just defined companies out of our bad actor rule! They are people conveniently at other times but they are not people now.\n\nMarketWatch: Is there anything since you were confirmed in August 2013 that has been incredibly frustrating?\n\nStein: It's been incredibly frustrating to not get all the Dodd-Frank rules done in eight years.\n\nMarketWatch: Like the executive compensation rules?\n\nStein: Yes, it's just unbelievable. I have pushed in every possible way that I could as just a commissioner, since the chairman sets the agenda and decides how rulemaking resources are allocated. That's been very frustrating.\n\nMore here:A decade after the crisis, the SEC still hasn't passed executive compensation rules\n\nMarketWatch: You got a few last words in at the open meeting. I was struck by the comment from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board chairman Bill Duhnke [who testified on Dec. 19 on the audit regulator's proposed 2019 budget and accounting support fee] about reinventing and revisioning the auditor inspection process.\n\nThere is an elephant in the room, the KPMG/PCAOB scandal, that is repeatedly ignored in public forums. I asked Chairman Clayton and Chairman Duhnke at the December AICPA conference about whether the PCAOB would report soon on any remedial actions taken in the wake of the scandal. Clayton said he can't speak about it because of the ongoing investigation and legal action and Duhnke looked like he didn't know what I was talking about.\n\nSee also:Regulators revive China audit dispute, but miss prime opportunity to fully explain why\n\nStein: I don't know why they won't talk about it. I had not heard the theory that they won't talk about it because of active enforcement activities. But, of course, we are not allowed to talk about active enforcement activities. I asked [Duhnke] a version of that question twice today and it was not answered. At the end of the day, you are asking the right questions. It goes back to transparency. If you had a problem you need to make sure the market knows you worked hard and you fixed the problem as best you are able.\n\nMarketWatch: You asked the section 10A question, too, one of my favorite issues. The GAO prepared a report at the request of Congress in 2000 and 2003 to compile data on how often auditors reported illegal acts to the SEC.\n\n(According to PCAOB audit standards, auditors are required, under section 10A(b)1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to make a report to the SEC if a client's illegal act has a material effect on the financial statements and if the firm is prevented from investigating the impact of the illegal act on the financial statements or informing the client's audit committee. It may be also be necessary for the auditor to resign if the company's board of directors does not take appropriate action.)\n\nStein: I did not know there was a GAO report.\n\nMarketWatch: And I did not know the PCAOB was looking at the standards regarding an auditor's obligation to report illegal client acts to the SEC. Many people who should know better do not know that provision exists or when it comes into play. What prompted you to ask Duhnke about it?\n\nStein: I asked a version of that question two years ago. I wanted to know about rules around the issue. And again it was a non-response. Duhnke said they are not done, not ready to talk about it yet.\n\n(Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote to KPMG and the PCAOB to ask about when KPMG had learned about its audit client Wells Fargo's illegal account opening activities and whether the firm had an obligation under audit standards to report the illegal activities to the SEC or to investors.)\n\nMarketWatch: It's not just a PCAOB issue. It's also an SEC issue because it's reporting to the SEC. The SEC told the GAO it was going to start tracking those reports better and it doesn't seem to have done that yet.\n\nStein: This goes back to how you have an effective enforcement program. I've been also very pleased with the whistleblower program. We have an office within enforcement with 12-15 people focused on this full-time which we did not have before Dodd-Frank. This program has been much more effective than the Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower provisions as a result. We are getting far more whistleblower reports now because of the Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation provisions but even more so because whistleblowers can get a percentage of the fine. I think that's been a bit of a game-changer. It encourages people to file a tip.\n\nMarketWatch: The SEC itself has said that the whistleblower program is more successful than ever before. In its most recent annual report for the program the program's chief writes, In FY 2018 alone, the SEC awarded more than $168 million in whistleblower awards to 13 individuals whose information and cooperation assisted the Commission in bringing successful enforcement actions. This amount exceeds the total amount awarded in all prior years combined and reflects the significance of the information that whistleblowers are reporting to the Commission.\n\nSee also:SEC proposes to limit whistleblower awards\n\nStein: In public policy I think about how can I create incentives, and avoid disincentives, for people to engage in certain behavior. It is very difficult to discover, investigate and bring enforcement actions in the accounting area, for example in complex accounting fraud.\n\nMarketWatch: So final questionâ€¦ What are you going to do next?\n\nStein: Ha! What should I do? I don't know yet but I am drawn to the academic space. I've been in government 21 years. The happiest people I know have a portfolio of things to do â€“ consulting, teaching, writing. I want to be able to keep doing the right thing.
When it comes to retirement savings, across all age groups, the United States is acutely behind where it needs to be.\n\nGiven this stark reality, it is little wonder that a 2015 survey found that 86% of Americans believe the nation faces a retirement crisis.\n\nBased on current trends, we will soon be facing rates of elder poverty unseen since the Great Depression. Of the 18 million workers between ages 55 and 64 in 2012, 4.3 million were projected to be poor or near-poor when they turn 65, including 2.6 million who were part of the middle class before reaching retirement age.\n\n It may be tempting to fault the savers for this sad state of affairs, but it is wrong to blame the victim. \n\nToday, 15 million elderly people spend less than $12 per day for food. By 2035, nearly 20 million retirees will be living in poverty or near-poverty. By 2050, that number will reach 25 million.\n\nAs the U.S. population continues to simultaneously grow and gray, and traditional pensions become relics of the past, elderly people living in deprivation will become a progressively greater share of the population. This wave of older poor Americans will strain our social safety net programs, from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to Medicaid. It will devastate federal, state, and local budgets.\n\nLeft unaddressed, poverty among the elderly could drive up federal income tax rates by 10 percentage points. The expenses of poor or near-poor older Americans will inevitably be passed on to other citizens, from higher Medicaid entitlements (for nursing homes and assisted living costs) to the taxpayer burden from a spike in homelessness.\n\nIt may be tempting to fault the savers for this sad state of affairs, but it is wrong to blame the victim. Here is the hard truth: existing tools make it impossible for most people to afford to save enough for retirement, and employers are not bridging the gap. People could try to delay retiring, but for various reasons that isn't always the worker's choice to make. Even those with significant savings to invest commonly see subpar returns, due in large part to lack of financial literacy and an industry short on reliable advice. Financial advisers, whose fees to their clients cost savers an estimated $17 billion per year, often guide them into trouble.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement, 60s are the new 50s\n\nIt is not individual workers who are to blame for our retirement crisis. Nor is it their employers. It is the fault of a haphazard, ramshackle system.\n\nWe cannot educate people out of this crisis. Given the reality on the ground, the most sophisticated among us would be hard-pressed to master the complex machinery of personal finance. Yet instead of focusing on reforms to fix our train wreck of a retirement system, our policy makers are distracted by campaigns for partial stopgap measures. As lawmakers grapple with payday loans and usurious credit card interest rates, retirement security goes by the boards. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that the United States had a $28 trillion retirement savings gap in 2015â€”the largest in the world. By 2050, they project this will grow to $137 trillion. This is almost a $3 trillion annual increaseâ€”five times the annual U.S. defense budget.\n\nIn sum, our country is facing an across-the-board retirement savings gap. Americans of almost all ages and income levels face nearly insurmountable obstacles to building a strong retirement foundation. One way or another, this crisis will affect us all in the years to come.\n\nA simplified approach to providing retirement security\n\n1.Every worker owns a portable retirement saving account. However long they work before retirement, employees maintain total control over a government guaranteed account. It is funded by a minimum 3% of the employee's salaryâ€”half contributed by the worker, half by the employer. A tax credit fully subsidizes the employee's share for all those earning under the median income and defrays the cost for everyone else. (We talk more about this later.)\n\n2.Savings are pooled and invested to achieve higher returns. Workers select a guaranteed retirement account, or GRA, pension manager who invests in relatively high-return, well-diversified strategies. People can change managers annually. Pension managers have a fiduciary duty to GRA holders and pro- vide a layer of protection between them and Wall Street.\n\n3.Upon retirement, the account is annuitized to provide consistent, government guaranteed income until death.\n\nWant to know more about the authors' solution?

The #MeToo movement has put women in the spotlight, but it hasn't pushed them into the C-suite.\n\nPepsiCo PEP, -0.82% chief executive Indra Nooyi, who announced her resignation Monday after 12 years at the helm of the company, has a theory as to why this is.\n\nWe get a lot of women in at the entry-level positions. As you get to middle management, women rise to those positions, and then that's the childbearing years, she told the Freakonomics radio show in February. And when they have children, it's difficult to balance having children, your career, your marriage, and be a high potential out-performer who's going to grow in the company.\n\nSo it starts to thin out as you move up, she added. We have to solve for that.\n\nDon't miss: Female directors only make up 16% of board seats in these U.S. companies\n\nIndeed, women accounted for 18% of chief executive officer replacements in 2017, unchanged from the year before, according to recent data from global outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The rate of women replacement CEOs is, however, up from 15.3% in 2015. Just 193 women CEOs accounted for 1,043 recorded replacements.\n\nCEOs at 11 companies stepped down because of sexual misconduct allegations last year (all were men), and of the seven companies that named a replacement, four chose women the report added. Women currently hold just 27 (5.4%) of CEO positions at those S&P 500 companies, according to Catalyst, a nonprofit that aims to build workplaces that are supportive of and welcoming for women. Here's a list.\n\nDon't miss:7 new laws to help women workers in 2018\n\nThis is what happens when homes are made permanently affordable\n\nAlso see:This is what happens when you pay women to take maternity leave\n\nBad times tend to be better for women to be given a chance to be CEOs, said Ariane Hegewisch, program director of employment and earnings at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. When a company isn't doing well and everyone shies away from it, companies think 'we've tried the usual, now let's give an outsider a chance.' Taking the helm during tumultuous times is often riskier for person's career, she added. (Case in point: Marissa Mayer's five-year tenure as Yahoo! CEO.)\n\nThe standstill in hiring female CEOs comes as women worldwide are sharing stories of how sexual harassment and assault has shaped their working lives, in some cases stopping their careers completely. Having more women leading companies is critical for fostering a culture of inclusiveness and safety, and also an atmosphere where other women can be promoted and receive equal pay for equal work. Women are paid around 83 cents on the dollar compared to men.\n\nThere has been significant progress made\n\nSome industries are promoting more women into the C-suite, according to Challenger & Gray. The legal industry saw the highest rate of women replacements at CEO level, at 50%, followed by government and non-profit (42%) and education (33%). There were no women replacements in the automotive, chemical, commodities or telecommunications industries.\n\nWomen face many hurdles in being promoted internally. Company superiors Corporate leaders still don't see both genders as equal, and women CEOs are twice as likely to have come from outside a company than chosen internally, according to a Harvard Business Review report, which looked at 2,000 top performing companies. The study found 1.5% â€” or 29 â€” of those CEOs were women.\n\nWhy are there not more women CEOs?\n\nThere's also a stigma around female leadership. Females negotiating for a promotion are also labeled as bossy, aggressive or intimidating, according to a third of respondents in a 2016 Lean In/McKinsey & Company survey of 34,000 employees at 132 companies. Race is a factor too, with the rate of promotion for white women at 7.4%, 6% for Latinas, 5.8% for Asians and 4.9% for African-Americans.\n\nBut studies, such as this 2013 report from the University of California, Berkeley, also back up Nooyi's opinions on the dearth of women CEOs. Having children also affects women more than men, because of the time they take off to prepare, give birth and then care for the child or children, experts say. The time away from the workplace, known as the motherhood penalty, can mean missed opportunities, shifting job responsibilities and lower earnings.
Opioid-related overdose deaths are higher in areas of the country where there's increased marketing of opioid products to physicians, highlighting the role the pharmaceutical industry plays in the opioid epidemic.\n\nA new study found that both deaths from opioid overdose and opioid prescriptions rose in areas of the country where physicians received more opioid-related marketing from pharmaceutical companies, such as consulting fees and free meals, according to an analysis of national data from 2013 to 2015 published in JAMA Network Open. Researchers looked at pharmaceutical marketing information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Open Payments database, linking it with data on county-level opioid prescribing and overdose deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention databases.\n\nInterestingly, researchers found the number of payments to doctors in an area had the greatest association with prescription numbers and opioid-related overdose deaths, more so than even the amount paid. Areas with a higher number of payments per capita saw increased opioid prescribing rates and more opioid-related overdose deaths.\n\nFor every three additional payments made to physicians per 100,000 people in a county, opioid-related overdose deaths were 18% higher, the study found.\n\nSee also:Are dentists hooking patients on opioids?\n\nA lot of the discussion around the pharmaceutical industry has been around high value payments, but what seems to matter is really the number of times doctors interact with the pharmaceutical industry, said Magdalena CerdÃ¡, the study's senior author and director of the Center on Opioid Epidemiology and Policy at NYU Langone Health.\n\nAccording to CerdÃ¡, the influence of pharmaceutical companies could be more subtle and widespread than initially thought. A physician's prescribing pattern could be influenced more by multiple inexpensive meals than a single high-value speaking fee, she noted.\n\nWe think it's because the more times physicians interact with someone from the pharmaceutical industry, the easier it is to build a relationship of trust, she said. We in no way think the prescribing is some kind of nefarious intentional behavior by physicians. The fact that it is the frequent, low-level payments that have the most effect shows that it's more unintentional, she said.\n\nSentenced to 30 Years for Selling Drugs to a Fellow Addict\n\nMarketing and advertising works, said Dr. Timothy Brennan, director of the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospitals. That doesn't mean that these physicians are corrupt or egregious prescribers, but pharmaceutical companies wouldn't be paying for these dinners if they didn't work, he said.\n\nDeaths from opioid-related overdoses are still rising. Prescription opioids are involved in 40% of all opioid overdoses, according to a report published by the CDC last year, and they're frequently the first opioids that people encounter before eventually moving on to illicit opioids. According to the International Narcotics Control Board, physician prescribers are the most frequent source of prescription opioids for those who use them non-medically.\n\nRead: Driven by fentanyl, overdose deaths in NYC reached record levels in 2017\n\nAlso read: Hospital ERs prescribe fewer opioids to some children, but not others\n\nEarlier this week, newsreports revealed just how aggressive the family that controlled the majority of Purdue Pharma was when it came to marketing the company's signature drug OxyContin. According to portions of a lawsuit filed by the state of Massachusetts against Purdue, Richard Sackler â€” a board member and former president â€” told the audience at a 1996 OxyContin launch party that the launch of OxyContin tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions that will bury the competition.\n\nAccording to reporting by STAT, Purdue's marketing campaigns focused on high-volume doctors, whom salespeople repeatedly visited. In 2012, sales managers threatened to fire all sales representatives in the Boston area because of what they saw as lackluster numbers.\n\nCerdÃ¡ acknowledged that states have been doing more to put limits on drug company marketing to physicians. For instance, she said, New Jersey recently passed a regulation to limit total payments to physicians at $10,000 annually.\n\nBut our study suggests that states should be thinking about not just capping value, but also the number of times physicians interact with the pharmaceutical industry, she said.\n\nThe Health Care Select Sector SPDR XLV, -0.06% was up 1.1% on Friday and has gained 4% in 2019 to date.

J.P. Morgan & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon said he isn't concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies will hurt the economy by pushing for tariffs and adopting a protectionist stance. During a call with reporters on Friday following the bank's quarterly results, Dimon said despite Trump's rhetoric and frequent use of Twitter, which indicate the real-estate mogul would retool trade agreements with Mexico and hold a hard line with countries like China, he expects the coming president's administration to do the right thing. Putting aside the one-liners and election rhetoric, I am comforted by the fact that he's putting real players on the playing field, Dimon said. Trump, for example, has repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency and has threatened to place tariffs on its goods. Critics fear that such a tacked would backfire as China would likely retaliate with tariffs of its own. The U.S. is the biggest market for China, accepting about a fifth of its exports. Shares of J.P. Morgan JPM, +1.65% were up nearly 2% on Friday, following its better-than-expected results, which were giving a lift to financials XLF, +0.52% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% . Give him some time, Dimon said of Trump. The J.P.

The U.K. government wants to postpone its March 29 exit from the European Union, but Prime Minister Theresa May cannot say so openly, according to one of the senior parliamentarians.\n\nYvette Cooper, the chair of parliament's Home Affairs committee, is leading a new effort within the U.K. legislature to get a postponement. She told the BBC this morning she believes May and other government ministers privately support the idea.\n\nThe UK's Brexit policy is essentially deadlocked following the prime minister's crushing defeat on her Brexit plans on January 15. Cooper, a politician from the UK's opposition Labour Party, will put her proposal to parliament today, after a scheduled address from May on what her next steps will be.\n\nAnother proposal, from pro-European rebel Conservative Dominic Grieve, would give parliament the power to hold a series of indicative votes to determine what form of Brexit could command majority support.\n\nThe pound was trading largely flat this morning, as May faces her latest parliamentary showdown. The British currency fell 0.02% to $1.2871 as of 12:51 GMT.\n\nThe days ahead: what to watch forâ€¦\n\nMonday, Jan 21: Theresa May's statement in Parliament on how she will proceed after the defeat of her Brexit plans. It is expected she will seek further concessions from the EU, and present her plans again, but EU politicians have indicated they will hold firm. And during the week ahead, MPs will now have the opportunity to put their own proposals.\n\nTuesday, Jan 29: MPs will vote on May's proposal and others. The U.K. parliament is believed to have a majority against the idea of crashing out of the EU without any withdrawal agreement in place, with many MPs fearing serious economic disruption.\n\nOn January 8, a thin majority of MPs voted against giving the government extra money to prepare for such a no deal outcome â€“ a symbolic vote intended to demonstrate this majority exists. That could also produce a vote in favor of Cooper's proposal to delay. But no deal remains the default outcome on March 29 if no other steps are taken.
NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) â€” It's old news that large segments of society have become deeply unhappy with what they see as the establishment, especially the political class. The Yellow Vest protests in France, triggered by President Emmanuel Macron's move to hike fuel taxes in the name of combating climate change, are but the latest example of the scale of this alienation.\n\nThere are good reasons for today's disgruntlement: four decades of promises by political leaders of both the center-left and center-right, espousing the neoliberal faith that globalization, financialization, deregulation, privatization, and a host of related reforms would bring unprecedented prosperity, have gone unfulfilled.\n\nWhile a tiny elite seems to have done very well, large swaths of the population have fallen out of the middle class and plunged into a new world of vulnerability and insecurity. Even leaders in countries with low but increasing inequality have felt their public's wrath.\n\nBy the numbers, France looks better than most, but it is perceptions, not numbers, that matter; even in France, which avoided some of the extremism of the Reagan-Thatcher era, things are not going well for many.\n\nPeter Morici:Britain should quit Europe and unilaterally declare free trade\n\nWhen taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry. The Yellow Vests' refrain speaks to their concerns: The government talks about the end of the world. We are worried about the end of the month.\n\nThere is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won't pass muster. And this is especially true of trickle down policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else.\n\nWhen I was at the World Bank, the first lesson in policy reform was that sequencing and pacing matter. The promise of the Green New Deal that is now being championed by progressives in the United States gets both of these elements right.\n\nThe Green New Deal is premised on three observations: First, there are unutilized and underutilized resources â€” especially human talent â€” that can be used effectively. Second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise. Third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future.\n\nIf the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next. It is better to leave a legacy of financial debts, which our children can somehow manage, than to hand down a possibly unmanageable environmental disaster.\n\nAlmost 90 years ago, President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to the Great Depression with his New Deal, a bold package of reforms that touched almost every aspect of the American economy.\n\nBut it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now. It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the U.S., with its crushing unemployment of the time. Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.\n\nEconomists have debated how effective the New Deal was â€” its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed. Nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time.\n\nSo, too, for a Green New Deal: It can provide public transportation, linking people with jobs, and retrofit the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. At the same time, these investments themselves will create jobs.\n\nIt has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy. Of course, some jobs â€” for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the U.S. â€” will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs.\n\nTo return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter. It would have made more sense to begin with creating new jobs before the old jobs were destroyed, to ensure that the profits of the oil and coal companies were taxed, and the hidden subsidies they receive eliminated, before asking those who are barely getting by to pony up more.\n\nThe Green New Deal sends a positive message of what government can do, for this generation of citizens and the next. It can deliver today what those who are suffering today need most â€” good jobs. And it can deliver the protections from climate change that are needed for the future.\n\nThe Green New Deal will have to be broadened, and this is especially true in countries like the U.S., where many ordinary citizens lack access to good education, adequate health care, or decent housing.\n\nThe grassroots movement behind the Green New Deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda. We need something positive to save us from the ugly wave of populism, nativism, and proto-fascism that is sweeping the world.\n\nThis article was published with permission of Project Syndicate â€” From Yellow Vests to the Green New Deal.
Be careful â€” your child's connected teddy bear may be watching you. Increasingly popular internet-connected toys pose a privacy concern for the children who use them and their families, as regulatory bodies work to crack down on violations.\n\nChildren's toy manufacturer VTech Electronics Limited VTKLF, -5.09% settled with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday over charges that it violated a U.S. children's privacy law by collecting personal information from children without telling parents or obtaining their consent. VTech is required to pay a $650,000 settlement and implement a comprehensive data security program, which will be subject to independent audits for 20 years.\n\nThe toy company came under scrutiny after it was hacked in 2015, exposing the names and ages of more than 6 million children who used its toys. The complaint against VTech said the company failed to provide adequate notice to parents about the information it was collecting and failed to encrypt user data, despite saying in its privacy policy it would. The company said in a statement it has improved its security measures since the hacking incident.\n\nWe are pleased to settle this two-year-old investigation by the FTC, said Allan Wong, Chairman and Group CEO of VTech Holdings Limited. Following the cyber attack incident, we updated our data security policy and adopted rigorous measures to strengthen the protection of our customers' data. We also took steps to address the technical notice and consent issues under [the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule].\n\nThere has been a rise in the number of high-profile hacks and data breaches affecting children. In April 2017, more than two million recorded messages from parents and children stored by CloudPets plush connected toy company were exposed to potential hackers, along with 800,000 emails and passwords. (CloudPets acknowledged the exposure, but said user information was not compromised.) In 2015, a hack of another toy company exposed the information of more than 200,000 children.\n\nThe FBI has been placing more of a focus on connected toys in recent months, said Jim Ivers, the vice president of marketing for the Software Integrity Group at Synopsys. The protection of children is a pretty emotional subject, he said. If child safety starts being compromised and manufacturers don't start looking out for it themselves, the government is going to step in and regulate. Although the FBI recommended parents check the background of the toys they buy their children, he said there is no central location to do that. It comes down to parents taking action regarding each particular toy, he said.\n\nHere are some of the measures you can take when purchasing connected gifts for the children in your life to minimize security risks:\n\n1. Turn off the toy when it isn't in use\n\nTurn off recording capabilities and microphone permissions when a toy is put back on the shelf. And this doesn't just apply to toys. Stickers made for laptops and other devices can also cover cameras while they are not in use to ensure that even if they are compromised, hackers won't have a window into your home.\n\n2. Don't give away unnecessary information\n\nIf the account requires personal information, simply give the bare minimum amount required, said Alan Brill, a senior managing director in Kroll's Cyber Security practice. Recognize you are not under oath there, you don't have to tell the truth, he said. Many devices don't have GPS services and there is no reason to give it your real address. People have to think about the consequences. Users can even invent false names, ages, dates of birth, and other data to minimize risk in the case that the website is hacked.\n\nMalls Struggle to Compete With Online Shopping\n\n3. Check the company's privacy policy\n\nThere is no government certification or central information resource informing consumers whether a specific brand of toy is hackable. However, a simple Google search could alert you to past hacks or other problems in the company. Aside from doing the obvious online search, buyers should also read the full privacy policies from the company and ensure the company will notify them in the case of a hack or data breach. Ensure the company notifies users when privacy policies change. Pay particular attention to where it stores user data and what security measures it takes to protect it, like whether the data is encrypted, and if it shares with (or even sells) data to third parties.\n\n4. Use multiple, strong passwords\n\nAmericans are not great at passwords: 31% of people have used a pet's name, 23% have used number sequences, 22% a family member's name and 21% a birth date. Passwords based on easily-discovered personal information are not effective. Neither are number or letter series. The passwords most frequently cracked by hackers include 123456, password, 12345, football, and qwerty, according to a report from security service SplashData. Experts suggest using password services like Lastpass or 1Password to generate and safe complex passwords for various accounts.\n\n5. Don't accept gifts without vetting them\n\nIt's a difficult scenario: your child opens a new connected toy from grandma at Christmas, but you are not sure about its safety features. Brill said it's important to do research on the toy before allowing a child to use it, and be willing to get rid of the device if it doesn't offer proper protection. In rare cases he has even learned of toys being sent to children randomly in the mail under the guise of them winning a prize in order to hack into the family's network and obtain sensitive information. Never accept a toy, especially a connected one, from an unknown source.
U.S. stocks closed the first session of the year on a positive note after volatile trading Wednesday, as a rebound by oil prices and worries about softer global growth vied for market dominance.\n\nMajor markets were closed on Tuesday for the New Year holiday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% rose 18.78 points to finish at 23,346.24, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% climbed 3.18 points, or 0.1%, to 2,510.03. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% rose 30.55 points, or 0.5%, to close at 6,665.94.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nInvestors kicked off the new year with more angst, driven by fears over the health of the world's second-largest economy, China, which has fueled an aversion to assets perceived as risky early in the day.\n\nBeijing's official read of manufacturing for December, released Wednesday, showed a more severe drop than one issued earlier, reflecting a fall to the weakest level since February 2016.\n\nThe Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 49.7 in December. A reading below 50 signals a contraction in activity, the first in 2 1/2 years.\n\nGrowth in Germany's manufacturing sector slowed, according to Markit's purchasing manager's index, which fell to a 33-month low of 51.5, further raising concerns about a global economic slowdown that investors worry could spill over into the U.S.\n\nThe economic softness comes as investors are concerned about a protracted tariff dispute between Beijing and Washington, which analysts have said could aggravate a retrenchment in both economies.\n\nMarket participants also are watching a partial U.S. government shutdown that is nearing its second week as President Donald Trump mets with top lawmakers to discuss reopening the government by resolving a dispute over funding for the expansion of the U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nBut stronger oil prices as production cuts by major oil producers were due to take effect helped to offset the market's weakness. West Texas Intermediate crude US:CLG9 for February delivery rose 2.6% and March Brent crude rose 0.3%.\n\nStill, some market observers cautioned against reading too much into the oil market's rebound.\n\nOn the data front, the final reading of IHS Markit's U.S. Purchasing Manager's Index for the month of December, came in at 53.8, versus expectations of 53.9, according to FactSet data.\n\nWhat were analysts saying?\n\nIn the past, government shutdowns haven't really affected markets, Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for U.S. equities at CFRA Research, told MarketWatch. If Congress and the White House are able to come to an agreement to end the partial shutdown soon, that should hold true, Stovall predicted.\n\nBut today's selloff could be attributed to the perceived lack of leadership in Washington, he said, as the shutdown underscores what could be a year of increased policy uncertainty, including questions surrounding U.S. trade policy.\n\nThe post-Christmas melt-up markets experienced in recent days is being unwound a bit, wrote Joel Kulina, analyst at Wedbush Securities in a note to clients.\n\nGiven global growth concerns and lingering uncertainty from trade/tariff wars, have to think investors will adopt a more cautious approach to 2019 to get a sense of when or where we may find a bottom, he wrote.\n\nWhat stocks were in focus?\n\nTesla Inc. TSLA, -4.39% sank 6.8% after the electric-car manufacturer announced fourth-quarter deliveries below analysts expectations, while also saying that it would cut the price of its Model S, Model X and Model 3 by $2,000.\n\nShares of Sirius XM Holdings Inc. SIRI, +1.28% were up 3.3% after JPMorgan upgraded the stock to overweight from underweight.\n\nShares of megacap tech shares were mostly higher with Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% up 0.1%, Facebook Inc. FB, +2.02% rallying 3.5% and Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.26% GOOGL, +1.43% gaining 0.9%. Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.24% was a notable exception, sliding 0.4%.\n\nNetflix Inc. NFLX, +0.73% closed unchanged at $267.66, belying an active day of trading for the stock. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analysts cut their price target on the streaming firm from $410 to $355. Netflix also announced that it hired away Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI, +0.76% CFO Spencer Neumann. Activision stock rose 1%.\n\nHow did other markets perform?\n\nAsian markets closed sharply lower with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.50% leading the way with a 2.8% decline while the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.17% fell 1.2%.\n\nIn Europe, equities ended the day mixed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.88% falling 0.1%, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.1%.\n\nThe U.S. dollar DXY, +0.07% strengthened and gold US:GCG9 settled slightly higher.\n\nâ€”Mark DeCambre contributed to this article.
A mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, but investors showed little reaction â€” lifting the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a record close and showing little appetite for traditional safe-haven assets despite violent scenes that temporarily interrupted the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory.\n\nThat's because the invasion of the Capitol did nothing to change expectations around the near-term political and economic outlook.\n\nRead: Presidential election confirmation paused in Congress after protesters storm Capitol building in Washington\n\nInstead, the driving force behind the session's stock-market gains and other financial-market moves appeared to be optimism over the prospect for another, larger round of aid spending following a Democratic sweep of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will give the party control of the Senate as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Jan. 20. Democrats retained control of the House in the Nov. 3 elections.\n\nNo matter the political consequences of today's takeover of the Capitol, Wall Street continues to be encouraged by the economic-enhancement possibilities of a Democratic 'trifecta,' Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA, told MarketWatch in an email after Wednesday's market close.\n\nInvestors have also remained upbeat about the potential for vaccine rollouts to allow a wider economic reopening, despite snags in distribution and worries about a more rapid spread of COVID-19 as a result of new variants.\n\nSee: Democrats win Georgia's runoff elections, giving their party control of U.S. Senate\n\nStocks were in rally mode before the onset of the violence.\n\nWhile stocks did pare gains, they finished the session solidly higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% rose 437.80 points, or 1.4%, to close at a record 30,829.40 after earlier breaching the 31,000 threshold for the first time. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% advanced 0.6% to close at 3,748.14, just 0.2% away from its all-time high finish, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.40% lost ground to end the day with a loss of 0.6%.\n\nTreasurys, which tend to serve as a haven during periods of unrest and uncertainty, instead saw prices fall, driving up yields. The 10-year yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.663% rose 8.6 basis points to 1.041%, finishing above the 1% level for the first time in nine months.\n\nThe U.S. dollar, which also tends to find support during periods of chaos, was also largely unfazed. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.11% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was little changed near 89.41.\n\nIt was surprising, however, to see how little the market reacted overall, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\nFinancial markets knew President Trump would not go away quietly, but they didn't expect this, Moya told MarketWatch in an email.\n\nCongress was set to resume the certification process, a key element in the peaceful transfer of power, on Wednesday evening.\n\nIn the end, the events at the Capitol will not change the election outcome and likely raise the importance that the Democrats were able to pull off the 'Blue Wave,' he said, referring to the sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, see significant ramifications for U.S. policy and the economy as a result of a united government, said Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, in a note.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden will be able to push through more aggressive stimulus packages and fund spending with higher taxes, Lien said, noting that Sen. Chuck Schumer, who will be majority leader, has deemed the passage of $2,000 stimulus checks to be a top priority for lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are playing down worries over potential tax increases as they focus on prospects for immediate stimulus, she said.\n\nStovall, in a note earlier Wednesday, underlined the market-positive factors associated with a unified government, which he said belied the widely held belief that market participants prefer a divided government.\n\nHe noted that all eight Democratic presidents since 1900 have been accompanied by a Democratic-controlled House and Senate, and that the stock market posted above-average performances in the first year of such Democratic trifectas six out of eight times, for an average gain of 11.3%.
Kansas City Fed President Esther George, a strong proponent of raising interest rates, said Tuesday now might be a good time to pause in the rate-hike cycle to allow the Federal Reserve to get its bearings.\n\nIn a speech to the Central Exchange in Kansas City, George said there are some developments, like slowing global growth that the central bank can't be definitive about.\n\nWe have to ability to take in more data and see how that plays out, George said.\n\nIt seems to me that we should proceed with caution and be patient as we approach our destination, George said.\n\nA pause would be a good idea if the inflation outlook remains benign or if downside risks emerge, she said. Further rate hikes could be necessary if inflation pressures emerge, she added.\n\nGeorge, who is a voting member of the Fed interest-rate committee this year, said the dampening effects from past policy actions have not fully played out, and that was another good reason to pause.\n\nAnother reason to delay, George said, was that it remains uncertain how much the slowly shrinking of the balance sheet was impacting the economy.\n\nWe don't really know how much the roll off is removing accommodation, she said, noting that central banks in other parts of the world are beginning to confront the need to shrink their balance sheets.\n\nInvestors are pricing in only a small chance of one rate hike in 2019, according to the CME Group's Fed Watch tool.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.625% has remained well 3% since late November.\n\nOverall, the Kansas City Fed president was optimistic about 2019, saying the outlook for the economy appeared favorable despite both upside and downside risks.\n\nGeorge said she expected growth around a 2% annual rate this year. Consumer and business confidence remained high.\n\nAt the same time, businesses in the Kansas City district are grappling with higher input costs, she said.\n\nI increasingly hear that input costs are rising, qualified workers are hard to find and retain, pricing power is limited, and that firms are pulling back rather than passing higher costs on to their customers, George said.\n\nThe Kansas City Fed president said she wanted the central bank policy statement to remove any explicit guidance about the direction of rates. In the last few years, it was easy to say that rates were going up.\n\nToday circumstances are different, she said. More rate hikes are certainly possible but not assured, she said\n\nIn December, the Fed said it judges that some further gradual increases in interest rates would be appropriate.
President Trump made his case for funding for a wall on the southern border in a televised address on Tuesday evening, but the American public's feelings about immigration are far more complicated.\n\nSpeaking directly to the American people, the president said, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, and the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?\n\n More than half of U.S. adults said they disapproved of Trump's actions on immigration in a recent survey. \n\nHe added, To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask, imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen, call Congress, and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.\n\nThat last statement begs the question: How do the American people feel about immigration and, specifically, national security?\n\nAccording to a survey released at the end of 2018 by Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America, people said they are less concerned about terrorism than they were one year earlier: 37% of respondents said they are worried about continued terrorism threats, down from 40% the previous year. In fact, 50% were more concerned about the country's political environment, up from 45% who felt the same way in 2017. That was the only concern that increased in the 2018 poll.\n\nDon't miss:The facts and public opinion work against Trump on his wall\n\nAmericans appear to be more divided over the more complex issue of immigration and, in particular, Trump's own immigration policies. More than half (52%) of U.S. adults said they disapproved of Trump's actions on immigration, according to another December poll released by PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Some 44% of survey respondents said they approved of President Trump's stance and policies in relation to immigration, while 4% said they were unsure.\n\n Fewer people are worried about terrorist threats than a year ago, a New Year's survey by Allianz Life suggests. \n\nOpinion is divided along political lines: 91% Republican respondents said they supported Trump's stance on immigration, versus 42% of Independents and 14% of Democrats. The rhetoric leaves a growing number of Americans who have real questions about immigration with no place to go, Ali Noorani, executive director for the National Immigration Forum, told PBS Newshour last month. Views on immigration even among members of political parties appear more complex when the questions are more nuanced.\n\nA separate NPR/Ipsos poll conducted last July said most Americans (69%) believe immigrants are an important part of American identity, including 81% of Democrats, 56% of Republicans and 71% of Independents. There were also differences among broadcast and cable news viewers. Some 52% of Fox News viewers, 78% of CNN viewers and 73% of NBC CMCSA, +0.89% , ABC DIS, -1.28% and CBS US:CBS viewers said they agreed with that statement.\n\n(Fox News-parent 21st Century Fox FOX, +3.34% and MarketWatch-parent News Corp. NWS, +2.44% share common ownership.)\n\nAccording to that July 2018 poll, however, 1 in 4 Americans also said that immigration is one of the most worrying issues facing Americans, an increase of 7 percentage points from February 2018. This concern was mostly driven by Democrats (whose worries about immigration rose from 10% to 20%) and Independents (up from 13% to 25%). Perhaps surprisingly given the president's GOP base, Republican concerns around immigration remained steady over that period at 34%.\n\nAccording to Allianz Life, Americans are optimistic about their finances\n\nPeople's feelings about immigration and their own finances are often connected, experts say. The stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride, spooking and confusing investors. Political tensions with China are fragile and unpredictable. There's growing concerns among business leaders of a recession in 2019. And yet Americans say they feel better about key aspects of their lives than they did a year ago, according to last month's Allianz Life survey.\n\n People's feelings about jobs, immigration and their own finances are often connected, political experts say. \n\nMany people seem to be more positive about their personal financial situation, with millennials in particular displaying a curious resistance to financial despondency, said Paul Kelash, vice president of Consumer Insights, Allianz Life. The only warning might be to ensure personal optimism doesn't lead to unnecessary spending that can derail a financial plan. (He has cause for concern: Revolving credit, which includes credit-card debt, recently exceeded $1 trillion.)\n\nThere are also signs that young people, in particular, will continue spending in 2019. Despite reporting better financial habits, the latest report noted some concerning trends. Only 50% of people listed money management as a New Year's resolution they're most likely to keep, down from 60% last year. What's more, the desire to better manage their money and put more money aside for a rainy day dropped for all respondents to 37% this year from 42% in 2017.\n\nâ€¢ In the face of volatile markets and increased concern of a recession in 2019, 19% were concerned about markets versus 38% the previous year.\n\nâ€¢ 23% of people surveyed say they're concerned about stagnant wages, but that's down 7 percentage points from 30% in 2017.\n\nâ€¢ People cited job security as a top concern (18%), but that percentage is also significantly reduced from 26% in 2017.\n\nâ€¢ 49% of Americans say they will choose health and wellness as their top priority for 2019 versus 27% who chose financial stability.\n\nâ€¢ 29% are concerned about identity theft and cybersecurity versus 38% in 2017, despite data scandals at certain global enterprises, including Facebook FB, +2.02%\n\n(The Allianz Life survey, which in 2018 received answers from a nationally representative sample of 1,278 respondents, is in its 10th year.)\n\nDon't miss:Brace yourself: This is how much America's 1% has saved\n\nAs for savings, the overall picture is not as healthy as it may seem for Americans. The median U.S. household currently holds just $11,700 in savings, according to an analysis released last August of Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data by personal-finance site Magnify Money. The bottom 20% by income have no savings and the second lowest 20% income earners have $26,450 saved. (Median balances, the midpoint value, are lower than the average savings rates.)\n\nPeople may have reason to care less about the recent stock-market volatility, but perhaps for all the wrong reasons. Just over half of Americans own stocks, a Gallup report recently concluded. That includes 401(k) plans, shares in an equity mutual fund and/or an IRA account. Worse, two-thirds of Americans do not even participate in or have access to a 401(k) plan, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In other words, they simply don't have a vested interest.\n\n(This story was updated on Jan. 13, 2019.)\n\nDon't miss:One in five American households have 'zero or negative' wealth
The U.S. central bank should be able to avoid drama like the infamous taper tantrum of 2013, said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, on Friday. We've learned the lessons of the past and are being thoughtful and watchful as the year unfolds, Harker said. While it should be a year of developments, it should also be a boring one, he said. Harker said the Fed has never before faced a need to shrink its balance sheet from $4.5 trillion, but said the process should remain slow and mechanical. The Philadelphia Fed President, who is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate committee this year, said he thinks two rate increases this year would be the appropriate path of policy.
The global stock-market turmoil so far this year has been driven by a non-stop flow of economic reports indicating a slowdown. If you're a long-term investor, you may be wondering how much market events in China should affect your strategy.\n\nBill Mann, chief investment officer of Motley Fool Asset Management, says long-term investors ought to stay out of China. But the same isn't true for other emerging economies, he argues.\n\nThe thing that is perhaps missed by people who don't pay close attention to the markets is that China is, at its core, not a market, in the same way you would think of a market in a western country, Mann said in an interview Friday.\n\nBill Mann, investment chief and senior portfolio manager at Motley Fool Asset Management. Motley Fool Funds\n\nThe Chinese stock market has been, in a lot of ways, an organ of policy. It was manipulated in the early part of 2015, as the Chinese government tried to jawbone it higher, so a lot of the Chinese companies could switch out debt through equity raises.\n\nThat may have been a very good thing for China over the long haul, since high levels of questionable corporate debt are a major concern, but in a market dominated by retail investors, extreme fluctuations of the stock market make China's government nervous.\n\nFirst, some background\n\nThe big drop in the Shanghai Composite Index that began late in July was stopped by the Chinese government in a heavy-handed way through trading halts, a ban on large investors selling shares and even outsized purchases of equities by the government.\n\nThis two-year chart puts things into some perspective, showing the huge gain for the Shanghai Composite before the decline:\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index has had a total return of nearly 56% over two years, compared with 10.2% for the S&P 500 in the U.S. FactSet\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index has greatly outperformed the S&P 500 during this two-year period, despite the painful volatility.\n\nWhen the summer turmoil in China was just beginning, we spoke with Kevin T. Carter, the founder of the Emerging Markets Internet and Ecommerce ETF EMQQ, -1.27% . Carter suggested that most investors outside of China should avoid investing in the country's A-shares, which are traded in renminbi on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. China lifted its ban on foreigners buying A-shares in late in 2014.\n\nCarter prefers to stay away from A-shares and to play China by limiting investments in Chinese companies to shares traded publicly in the United States, owing to more transparency of financial reporting and less interference by regulators.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Markets Index 891800, -0.46% excludes China A-shares, but it does include shares of Chinese companies traded in the U.S. This means the index is light on China, at least for now, since MSCI may well include the A-shares at some point.\n\nKeeping in mind that a period of less than six months is quite short for a long-term investor, here's how Carter's fund has performed against the Shanghai Composite Index and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index from July 10 through Jan. 7:\n\nFactSet\n\nThe Emerging Markets Internet and Ecommerce ETF's decline of 9.8% compared with a 12.9% drop for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and a 17.8% decrease for the Shanghai Composite.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThis could be the year that China's government begins to move closer to allowing its stock market to function as a true market, with normal fluctuations and bull and bear markets.\n\nWhen asked which areas of opportunity he sees for long-term investors, in light of all the turmoil, and especially China, Mann of Motley Fool Asset Management said: Contrarians do better long term because they are able to do things that are difficult in the moment.\n\nWith that in mind, he pointed out that emerging markets, excluding China, have badly underperformed developed markets over the past three years. He recommends,not surprisingly, a mutual fund he manages, the Motley Fool Epic Voyage Fund US:TMFEX.\n\nThe fund was launched in 2011, and keeps at least 90% of its assets invested outside the U.S. The fund also generally steers clear of China, although Mann said it was holding American Depositary Receipts of Baidu Inc. BIDU, -2.18% , which are traded in the U.S.\n\nMann said the Epic Voyage Fund commenced operations at almost the exact second that hasn't worked very well. The fund's three-year total return through Jan. 7 was minus 5.2%, compared with minus 3.9% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, according to FactSet.\n\nMorningstar provided lists of the top 10 emerging-market ETFs and open-ended mutual funds over the past three years, sorted by average annual total return.\n\nTop-performing emerging-market ETFs:\n\nTop-performing emerging-market mutual funds:\n\nThe three-year trend has been clear, keeping in mind that diversified emerging-market ETFs and mutual funds have had relatively low holdings in China, because of the ban on foreigners holding Chinese A-shares, which was lifted in late 2014. India has been the strongest emerging market. There are, however, two diversified emerging-market ETFs among the top 10 over the past three years and four diversified mutual funds.
One way an opioid addiction can start is in the medicine cabinet, where leftover medications from painful procedures can languish for months or years.\n\nNow, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.31% is offering a new kind of solution, with a free product that allows consumers to safely and conveniently throw out what's left over of their medication.\n\nThe product, DisposeRx, consists of a small packet â€” around the size of flower food that typically accompanies a bouquet â€” that is dumped in a pill bottle with water and shaken, turning the medication into a biodegradable gel, which is then thrown out.\n\nOnce turned into gel, leftover opioids can't be abused, according to DisposeRx Chief Executive John Holaday.\n\nDisposeRx has undergone extensive testing to check that premise, including trying out various household items that might be utilized, and we can't find a way to extract opioids, he said.\n\nWal-Mart\n\nPharmacies like Wal-Mart have become one front line in confronting the opioid crisis, with companies rolling out expanded access to the opioid overdose antidote and participating in programs that monitor opioid prescriptions.\n\nRead more: Walgreens, CVS are taking this big step to fight the opioid epidemic\n\nSafe medication disposal is a key facet of the opioid crisis, with accounts of the prescription drugs being obtained by teenagers in their family homes, by visitors at someone's house, or even by prospective buyers at an open house.\n\nWhen people are addicted, they'll do a lot of things to feed their physical addiction â€” it becomes a drive, said John Auerbach, president and chief executive of policy, think tank and advocacy group Trust for America's Health, which focuses on public health and prevention issues.\n\nIt's also a safety issue, especially with young children around.\n\nHowever, it has been difficult to tackle.\n\nMany pharmacies sell a pouch that can be used in a manner similar to DisposeRx to destroy medications. Though such pouches have been distributed through various programs, they aren't always free and are typically larger than a pill bottle.\n\nThere also aren't many medication take-back programs. Existing ones often don't accept controlled substances like opioids, and those that do aren't always frequent or convenient.\n\nThat may be changing. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -2.59% , for example, made disposal kiosks available in hundreds of pharmacies in 2016; the program collected 72 tons of unused medications in its first year.\n\nRelated: Sam's closures quashed PR bonanza of Wal-Mart pay hikes and bonuses, but analysts have eye on longer term\n\nWal-Mart said Tuesday that its new program will be available immediately in all of its 4,700 pharmacies (though patients in Rhode Island and Washington will receive a different, free disposal solution because of ongoing third-party testing) and for Sam's Club patients.\n\nDisposeRx packets will be available with new opioid prescriptions, and offered for free every six months for individuals with recurring opioid prescriptions; existing patients can also request a free packet.\n\nIn addition, the best part is that patients don't have to take leftover prescription drugs to take-back locations, said Marybeth Hays, executive vice president of Wal-Mart's consumables, health and wellness business.\n\nIt's a positive move for a business to become involved in helping to control the opioid epidemic, Trust for America's Health's Auerbach said. And so Wal-Mart is to be applauded for that.\n\nIn a separate development, Wal-Mart recently said it plans to close 63 Sam's Club locations, which observers said put a damper on the company's new associate benefits.
They're talkin' bout their generation.\n\nWith their new single Young and Inexperienced Nalani and Sarina Bolton, the 24-year-olds who make up an eponymous indie duo,are looking to draw attention to the economic challenges faced by today's young people and to humanize those experiencing them.\n\nThe song, which features lyrics such as, Moved back home, heavy as a stone / Boxes filled with clothes and piles of student loans, is the latest example of student debt and the obstacles 20-somethings face landing a decent job entering pop culture.\n\nThe two said they were inspired to write the song after watching those around them struggle after leaving college. A lot of our friends, they're at the age now where they're coming back from college and they're really anxious to find work, but with the way that the economy is, they've just found it super, super hard to get a job that they're happy with, said Nalani Bolton.\n\nStruggling to pay student debt? Here's what you need to know.\n\nRecent graduates face higher unemployment\n\nThe economy has improved broadly and for young people specifically, but recent college graduates still face challenges. Young people who graduated college in 2017 faced an underemployment rate of 11.9%, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank focused on labor issues. That's up from 9.6% in 2007 and 7.1% in 2000. Workers are typically defined as unemployed if they're unwillingly working part-time or in a job that they're overqualified for.\n\nRising college costs also mean that these recent graduates who may not be working in a job that uses their degree are likely faced with student loans. About 44 million Americans are coping with $1.4 trillion in student debt.\n\nNalani and Sarina, who grew up in New Jersey and have performed for Bruce Springsteen, heard stories of their friends' challenges, including struggling to get a job without experience and moving from city to city chasing unpaid internships until they couldn't afford to anymore. But it wasn't until they read statistics on what their friends were facing during the lead up to the song's release that they began to understand the severity of what kids after college have to go through.\n\nThe sisters say they're lending a voice to generational struggle\n\nEven though they were troubled by the data, the sisters said the goal of the song isn't to share statistics or preach about solutions, but instead to capture the feelings of desperation and hopelessness that come with not being able to find work after you've studied and taken on debt in hope of success.\n\nIt's not an experience the two can relate to directly. They became professional musicians straight out of high school and never attended college. Their parents, a psychotherapist and a recently retired insurance agent, supported their decision, noting their passion and drive. They're also big music fans themselves.\n\nThough the two had an unconventional young adulthood, they do know what it's like to be underestimated for your youth and inexperience. The music business has so many ups and downs and can be a dirty world, Nalani Bolton said. It's easy to not be taken seriously.\n\nTheir hope is that the song and the album it's a part of, which they say will focus on other challenges and experiences faced by millennials, will promote generational understanding and will help 20-somethings to be taken more seriously.\n\nWhenever we bring up the word millennial or we hear it around, especially when it's brought up with older people, it's such a toxic word right now, Sarina Bolton said. The goal with us as artists and song writing is to wake people up, to get people to start thinking and be aware of these issues and maybe think differently, Nalani added.
HARTFORD, Conn. (MarketWatch) â€” It's not uncommon for student loan borrowers to have gripes about the often complicated process of paying back their loan.\n\nA well-documented trail of complaints from borrowers, consumer advocates and government reports indicates that dealing with a student loan servicer â€” a borrowers' main point of contact during the repayment process â€” can be challenging.\n\nThe situation is so challenging that even a banking regulator has struggled to figure it out. Bruce Adams, the general counsel for Connecticut's department of banking, recounted his exasperation in dealing with a servicer over his wife's student loans in a recent interview. After multiple calls to the company where he heard different answers to the same question, Adams, 43, had finally had enough.\n\nI expressed my frustration and said 'I am a financial lawyer and I understand the words that you're using. I don't understand what you're telling me, he said. If it doesn't make sense to me, how is it going to make sense to anyone who is not in this field?\n\nAdams told a version of this story to a room of lawmakers last year during a hearing on legislation to address the challenges facing student loan borrowers in the state. His story was pretty convincing, according to Democratic state representative Matt Lesser, who as co-chair of the banking committee in the Connecticut general assembly spearheaded the legislative effort.\n\nTo hear the General Counsel for the state department of banking say 'this is so infuriating, this is so complicated, I can't figure it out,' I think we all recognize that the average citizen in the state doesn't stand a chance, said Lesser, 32, sitting next to Adams at a conference table in the Connecticut Assembly's legislative office building.\n\nConnecticut's student loan bill of rights, which was signed into law by the state's Democratic governor, Daniel Malloy, last September, aims to level the playing field.\n\nIn a nationwide report released Thursday, Generation Progress, the youth-focused arm of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, noted that Connecticut is the first state to pass a student loan bill of rights with an ombudsman, the servicer licensing requirement and other consumer protections for borrowers. The report highlighted Connecticut's efforts as one of the ways states can take action on the student debt crisis without waiting for the federal government. Other states are attacking the student loan crisis in different ways, the report noted, including, working to help borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates, holding for-profit colleges accountable and reversing laws that penalized student loan borrowers behind on their payments by taking away their driver's or professional license.\n\nBut Connecticut's approach to the problem is one of the most comprehensive of any state, said Maggie Thompson, the campaign manager of CAP initiative Higher Ed, Not Debt and one of the authors of the report. Connecticut's legislation includes three main components: The creation of a borrower education and information course so families can have a better sense of their obligations before they take on a loan, an ombudsman â€” paid for by fees levied on servicers â€” to help track and field complaints about the loan repayment process, and a requirement that servicers handling Connecticut borrowers' loans be licensed by the state's banking department to ensure they live up to basic consumer protections.\n\nWith that step, Connecticut is going further than the federal government and other states across the country in regulating servicers, the companies that often play the biggest role in a student loan borrower's experience.\n\nStates don't want to wait for Washington, they want to get ahead of the problem, Rohit Chopra, the former student loan ombudsman at the CFPB and a senior fellow at CAP, said in an interview.\n\nStudent loan servicing industry needs reform, advocates say\n\nConsumer advocates have argued for years that the student loan servicing industry is in need of reform. They cite troubling practices they say are keeping borrowers from paying back their loans. In a September report from the CFPB, borrowers complained that servicers failed to post payments on time or applied payments to the interest of loans instead of to the principal, allowing additional interest to accrue.\n\nServicers also aren't providing borrowers with enough information about their best options for repayment, consumer advocates say. Federal student loan borrowers have a variety of protections and payment plans to choose from, which should make it nearly impossible for a borrower to default. And yet, one in four student loan borrowers is in default or struggling to repay their loan, according to the CFPB. Servicers may be in part to blame â€” as borrowers' main point of contact during the repayment process they're not doing enough to help borrowers find the repayment plans that are right for them, advocates say.\n\nIf you think about the role of the servicer, that is the face of the loan to the borrower, Adams said. Now if you stick in an intermediary and that company is not regulated, you're just creating so much risk to the borrower.\n\nThere isn't a national standard regulating the student loan servicing industry yet. The CFPB, the Department of Education and the Department of Treasury issued a joint statement of principles in September laying out guidelines for how servicers should operate, indicating federal rules may be forthcoming. But Connecticut created its own in the meantime and other states could be poised to do the same in their coming legislative sessions.\n\nYou are seeing more states looking at legislative options to enhance protections for borrowers and police the industry, Chopra said. The CFPB has indicated interest in doing rule making, but many states want to move at a much faster pace.\n\nSo far, Connecticut is leading the charge on these efforts, but Lesser said he's heard from lawmakers in other states interested in introducing similar legislation. In addition to the Bill of Rights, Lesser worked with his colleagues on the higher education committee to lower interest rates on state-sponsored student loans and to create a vehicle to allow borrowers to refinance their debt at lower interest rates, a step other states and localities are taking as well.\n\nLesser and his colleagues announcing the interest rate cut on state-sponsored student loans. Connecticut House Democrats\n\nChopra said he's not surprised state legislators are eager to address student loan debt, given that they're often the first to hear about financial issues from their constituents. He noted that politicians at the local level were some of the first to sound the alarm on the predatory mortgage lending that contributed to the financial crisis.\n\nHow Connecticut created its student loan bill of rights\n\nAnd indeed, the idea for the student loan bill of rights bubbled up from a coalition of advocacy groups led by Subira Gordon, a legislative analyst in the state's department of African-American affairs. Gordon, 31, said they heard from struggling borrowers who didn't know enough about their options when they first took on their loans or were grappling with servicers and in need of help. There's no one in this equation that's looking out for the consumer, Gordon said.\n\nGordon and Lesser hammered out a wish list of legislative fixes to help deal with the issues Gordon was seeing and the two worked with Adams to figure out which ones were feasible. Tackling Connecticut student loan borrowers' challenges from a financial regulation perspective, instead of simply a higher education policy perspective, was important, Lesser said, because student debt both creates personal financial challenges for borrowers and has consequences for the economy more broadly.\n\nIn fact, the idea to regulate student loan servicers came in part from the state's experience regulating mortgage servicers, who policy makers and consumer advocates say engaged in many of the same practices in the lead up to the financial crisis.\n\nOne of the critical changes we had to make is to think about the student debt crisis as something that's a systemic problem for the financial sector of the economy, Lesser said.\n\nDoes the Bill of Rights go far enough?\n\nThe student loan bill of rights is a valiant effort at helping Connecticut borrowers better manage their debt, said Joshua Cohen, a Connecticut lawyer specializing in student loan issues. But he's concerned they won't be as effective as legislators hope. He's confident the ombudsman and the licensing requirements will be effective at regulating servicers of private student loans, but he's worried that the companies who service federal student loans will argue they won't have to abide by the Connecticut statute because federal law pre-empts it. Cohen said he's not sure that argument would hold up (the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed in the wake of the financial crisis made it more difficult for federal government laws to pre-empt state laws regarding consumer protection), but he said it's still a concern.\n\nIntent-wise it's a good thing, he said of the new laws. But after reading the Connecticut statute, their new servicing license, I'm not really sure it's going to do anything. I applaud the effort and let's see it run its course.\n\nEven Lesser wonders how much of a dent the legislation will make in curbing certain predatory practices that leave borrowers in crippling debt. He recently heard from a constituent who was lured by a for-profit college in West Virginia into taking on roughly $100,000 worth of debt to earn an online degree that's completely worthless in the state, he said.\n\nThe Connecticut's package of laws doesn't directly address that borrower's problem. We've started to take some steps in the right direction but there's still a lot more work to be done, said Gordon.\n\nStill, Lesser, Gordon and Adams are hopeful the bill of rights will help Connecticut borrowers avoid being devastated by student debt and that it may inspire other states to better regulate the student loan industry. The stakes are high, if borrowers don't find better ways to manage the $1.3 trillion in student loan debt, the consequences could be severe for the U.S. economy, Adams said.\n\nIf you want to look at the worst case scenario, look at what happened with mortgage backed securities, he said, referring to the predatory home loans that were packaged into investment vehicles which dropped precipitously in value when borrowers started to default on their mortgages â€” a major contributor to the financial crisis.
Expansions don't die of old age. They get murdered. â€” Ben Bernanke\n\nAll it took was some wild swings and big losses in U.S. stock prices for the R word â€” recession â€” to start tripping off people's tongues.\n\nAnd not just run-of-the-mill observers.\n\nAlmost half of the 134 U.S. chief executive officers surveyed by the New York Times last month said they expect the U.S. economy to be in recession by the end of 2019. That forecast was echoed by almost half of the chief financial officers who participated in the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook survey in December. (It would appear that the inhabitants of the C Suite communicate with one another!)\n\nAlso read:Powell says Fed is 'watching and waiting' on interest rates\n\nThere is nothing in the data to suggest that the U.S. economy is about to hit the skids. Yes, global growth is slowing, and tariffs are starting to bite, disrupting global supply chains, raising input costs and cutting into corporate profits. But the domestic economy, especially the labor market, has yet to show any significant signs of stress.\n\nTo the contrary, Friday's powerhouse of an employment report for December, with its 312,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, upward revisions to the previous two months, rising labor-force participation and the biggest increase in hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers since the Great Recession, was nothing if not encouraging for an expansion that will turn 10 in June.\n\nExpansions don't die of old age, of course: an adage former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen reiterated last week at a panel discussion with her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, and successor, Jerome Powell, at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta. Two things usually end them, she said.\n\nOne is financial imbalances, and the other is the Fed.\n\nYellen went on to say that when the Fed is the culprit, it is generally because the central bank is forced to tighten policy to curtail inflation and ends up overplaying its hand. (She didn't mention that the Fed's monetary policy may have a hand in creating financial imbalances.)\n\nWith inflation showing little sign of veering from the Fed's 2% target, and inflation expectations well-anchored, the Fed is under no pressure to bring out the heavy artillery.\n\nBernanke elaborated on Yellen's point, accusing the central bank of, in essence, murder. It takes an aggressive act on the part of the monetary authority to bring an expanding economy to a halt and cause it to shift into reverse.\n\nBernanke has history on his side.\n\nThe Fed's murder weapon is aptly encapsulated in the pictorial representation of the yield curve, or term structure of interest rates. When the central bank raises its benchmark, short-term rate to a level that exceeds that on a risk-free, long-term rate, such as the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.625% â€” that is, when the term spread inverts â€” a recession is sure to follow, with an average lead time of 14 months.\n\nAn negative term spread suggests that the expected short-term rate, as reflected in the long rate, is below the current short-term rate. The implication is that the economy will require an infusion from the monetary authority â€” specifically, reductions in the benchmark rate â€” to revive it.\n\nIn the past, the Fed has consciously inverted the curve, finding all sorts of reasons to assert that this time is different, that an inverted curve doesn't mean what it has always meant in the past.\n\nThis time around, there has been such intense focus on the curve, both instructive (Fed research on the powerful signal inherent in the term structure) and frivolous (market chatter that attaches some importance to a short-lived inversion between, say, 3- and 5-year notes), that the Fed may be more circumspect about tapping the brakes if the next adjustment in interest rates is certain to push the funds rate above the yield on the 10-year Treasury.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard warned against additional rate increases in the absence of inflationary pressure, citing the recession risk being telegraphed by the long end of the bond market, which is driving the yield-curve flattening.\n\nTen-year Treasury yields declined by almost 70 basis points in the last two months: from 3.24% in early November to 2.55% last week amid the stock market rout before inching their way back to 2.72% in the wake of Friday's solid jobs report. In that same period, the Fed has raised the funds rate by a mere 25 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.\n\nWith long rates defying the Fed, policy makers really need to be patient because one more rate increase, all things equal, will invert the term spread.\n\nPowell used all the right buzzwords and phrases to calm markets on Friday. He said (I'm consolidating here) that there is no preset path for policy; that, given muted inflation, the Fed can be patient and see how the economy evolves; that we are listening to the markets and are always prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly to promote our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices.\n\nAnd that willingness to change policy applies to balance-sheet normalization as well as to interest rates.\n\nThe stock market could not have written a more perfect script. And the wait-and-see message was re-enforced Wednesday with the release of the minutes of the Dec. 18-19 meeting, the tone of which was much more deferential to global economic and financial market considerations than Powell let on at the time of his post-meeting press conference.\n\nThe current spread between the effective funds rate and 10-year Treasury is about 30 basis points. Historically, a spread that narrow has been either a precursor to inversion (the Fed ignores the signal and keeps raising rates) or the start of a capitulation (the Fed realizes the error of its ways and begins to ease aggressively).\n\nShould the Fed, with malice aforethought, invert the curve, I am confident this time will not be different in terms of the economic outcome. The only thing we can hope is that the Fed's response is different.
The Dow closed in record territory Wednesday, despite hundreds of President Trump's supporters storming the U.S. Capitol, disrupting a joint session of Congress convened to certify Joe Biden's victory over Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Party has won both U.S. Senate seats in the Georgia runoff elections, according to the Associated Press, increasing the chances that President-elect Biden will be able to advance his agenda.\n\nOn Tuesday, stocks finished higher:\n\nThe Dow rose 167.71 points, or 0.6%, to 30,391.60\n\nThe S&P 500 added 26.21 points, or 0.7%, to 3,726.86\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index gained 120.51 points, or 1%, to trade at 12,818.96.\n\nThe Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.73% rose 1.8%.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nPolitics and the outbreak of civil discord in Washington dictated Wednesday's trading action as Trump supporters breached the Capitol complex and fought with police, disrupting a joint session of Congress that had just begun the process of certifying, state by state, the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election in the wake of a divisive election, with flames having been fanned in the two months since Election Day by claims of fraudulent conduct that have met with no success in dozens of state and federal courts.\n\nWatch: Hundreds of Trump supporters storm Capitol Hill, break fences and fight with police\n\nRead: McConnell defends election results as GOP splits over Congress confirming Biden victory\n\nAfter hours of progressively aggressive protest activity, Trump supporters caused police in D.C. to order the evacuation of the Capitol building and for the National Guard and Department of Homeland Security agents to be deployed.\n\nI don't think protests are a surprise, Randy Frederick, Charles Schwab's vice president of trading and derivatives, told MarketWatch. What I think might be a surprise is the security to keep people out of the Capitol building was weaker than what people expected. That is probably a surprise to everyone.\n\nThe unrest followed the runoff elections for U.S. Senate seats in Georgia that roiled parts of the market, sparking a rotation into downtrodden stocks hit hard by an economic crisis sparked by the pandemic.\n\nDemocrat Raphael Warnock defeated incumbent Republican Kelly Loeffler for one U.S. Senate seat, and a narrowed win was called late Wednesday for Democrat Jon Ossoff over Republican Sen. David Perdue in the other race, according to the Associated Press. A Democratic sweep in Georgia gives the party effective control of the Senate, with the seat count split 50-50, including the two independents who caucus with the Democrats, as Vice Presidentâ€“elect Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes as the chamber's president.\n\nWith Democrats now set to control both houses of Congress, the odds are seen by the markets as improving that Biden will have success in implementing his legislative agenda.\n\nThe key is the possible change in the landscape of political power in Washington, D.C. and what that will mean for spending, Jeanette Garretty, chief economist at Robertson Stephens Wealth Management, told MarketWatch.\n\nInvestors are most immediately saying this is going to mean more money spent in support of individuals and a greater likelihood of an infrastructure deal, she said. But buried in all this is probably also an assumption that it will be easier to get money to states for a more efficient rollout of the vaccine.\n\nTechnology stocks XLK, -0.08% fell, lagging value-oriented stocks on expectations that a Democrat-controlled Congress could lead to higher taxes and tighter regulation of internet-based businesses.\n\nU.S. bond yields climbed as fixed-income investors wagered that a blue wave in Washington would increase government spending to combat COVID-19's impact on the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, economic data published Wednesday morning gave a grimmer view of the U.S. economy than analysts expected. The Automatic Data Processing report on private-sector employment showed the first drop in jobs since April. Private-sector jobs fell by 123,000, ahead of the more closely followed Friday employment report from the Labor Department.\n\nThe U.S. IHS Market service sector purchasing managers index for December fell to 54.8 in December, down from 58.4 in November, signaling a slower expansion amid a surge in coronavirus cases. However, factory orders rose for a seventh month.\n\nOn the coronavirus front, the U.S. counted at least 238,763 new cases on Tuesday, and at least 3,648 people died, according to a New York Times tracker. In the past week, the U.S. has averaged 219,650 cases a day.\n\nMinutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting in December that were released Wednesday showed the rate-setting committee decided not to extend the maturity of its Treasury holdings.\n\nSee also: Here's what a 'blue wave' forming in Washington means for markets\n\nWhich companies were in focus?\n\nRead: Here's what a 'blue wave' forming in Washington means for markets\n\nWhat did other markets do?\n\nRead next: 10 Biden tax proposals that would sail through a Democratic-controlled Senate â€” and how to prepare for them
Last Thanksgiving, after months of planning a trip to Paris around a sweet $350 round-trip flight deal I had found, I made my way to the airport after a day of stuffing my face with friends in Brooklyn â€” but not quite quickly enough.\n\nI left my friend's apartment in Brooklyn two hours before my 11 p.m. flight and called a local car service. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. The driver arrived 20 minutes late, complained he hadn't slept in three days, and erratically took the slowest route to JFK through crowded holiday traffic. I arrived at 10:10 p.m. â€” an hour after I had left my friend's place and 50 minutes before my flight.\n\nNorwegian Air NAS, -0.26% informed me its system does not allow passengers to check in less than an hour before a flight, and no amount of pleading could change it. (Airlines must submit passenger lists to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.) Determined to salvage my trip, I paid $600 for a flight the next day, kicking myself for not arriving earlier and vowing to be hours early from now on when I travel. I asked Norwegian not to cancel the return leg of my $350 flight, and the airline agreed.\n\nMy replacement flight never left the runway\n\nI arrived at the airport five hours early the next day so as to not make the same mistake again. I sat in the terminal with a book. My flight was supposed to board at 8:30 p.m., but when that time came the flight had been delayed. And delayed again. And again. Finally, after allowing passengers to board at 1 a.m., the pilot announced the plane had to be evacuated due to a mechanical error.\n\nI was back to Square 1, and my flight, once again, was rescheduled for the next day. Already three days late to the Airbnb I had paid for in Paris, I decided to give up, for now, on my dream of seeing the City of Light. I called the airline to cancel my flight, and my credit card was immediately refunded the $600 one-way flight â€” as well as my $350 original flight, essentially erasing my dumb financial mistake of arriving to the airport late, because they were both on the same ticket.\n\nThen a Facebook group for travelers alerted me to another silver lining: Norwegian Airlines owed me $700.\n\nThe reason for my unexpected $700 windfall\n\nUnder EU Regulation 261/2004, passed in February 2005, passengers whose flight arrival at its final destination is delayed by three hours or more are entitled compensation of between 250 and 600 euros, depending on the distance of the flight and the amount of delay. In my case, that amounted to â‚¬600, or $722 at current exchange rates.\n\nIn Europe many passengers know about the strict guidelines regarding long delays on airlines and are quick to claim what they're owed, said Brian Sumers, airline reporter for travel analysis site Skift, but the refund policy is little-known in the U.S.\n\nThat's a shame, because for many passengers this is easy money, he said. Sometimes airlines are open about what passengers are entitled to. Other times they're more cagey and rely on travelers to do the research.\n\nPassengers can also use a third-party service like AirHelp that can badger an airline on your behalf, even taking it to court if it denies payment. AirHelp takes a slice of the payment â€” around 25% â€” in exchange for its services: â‚¬63 ($78) on compensation of â‚¬250 ($301), â‚¬100 ($120) from compensation of â‚¬400 ($480) or â‚¬150 ($180) of â‚¬600 ($722). It only charges passengers if their claim is successful.\n\nCompensation rules are stricter for U.S. airline passengers\n\nUnder U.S. regulations, benefits are scarcer: Travelers are only entitled to food, water and access to toilets within two hours of the start of a delay. They are also entitled to updates every 30 minutes regarding the status of the flight and what's causing the delay, if known.\n\nHere's how workplace diversity can help companies boost profits\n\nAirline travelers in the U.S. don't have as many rights as EU travelers when it comes to flight delays, cancellations and boarding denials on domestic flights, AirHelp's chief executive officer, Henrik Zillmer, said.\n\nStill, AirHelp recommends that passengers experiencing long delays or canceled flights hold on to their boarding pass and any other travel documents, request an alternate flight to their destination, and negotiate with the airline for compensation for inconvenience.\n\nCustomers who are individually bumped from a flight because it is overbooked, not because of a delay or cancellation, are entitled to 200% of their one-way fare in compensation in cash if their delay is more than one hour but less than two, according to federal regulations. If the delay is more than two hours, they are entitled to 400% of a one-way fare in cash.\n\nAs for me, I continued to receive text updates about the flight I'd decided not to board to Paris, which finally left three days later â€” after more than 80 hours of delay. I saved all of my receipts and sent a detailed invoice of expenses incurred in my 24-hour airport saga to Norwegian.\n\nMore than a month later, I was contacted by a company representative agreeing to pay me $800: $700 for the EU Regulation 261/2004, $50 for my taxi home after my first canceled flight, and $50 for food I ate at the airport. The $800 I received minus the $100 in costs incurred at the airport and $260 in money I lost on the Airbnb left me with $440 in profit from my failed Paris trip. I may use that money toward planning another vacation to Europe in the new year. And what airline will I chose? Despite all the delays â€” Norwegian.\n\nBut next time I'll make sure to arrive early.
The selloff in U.S. Treasurys resumed on Monday, pushing yields higher, after Senate leaders reached a deal to end the government shutdown.\n\nWhat are Treasurys doing?\n\nThe yield for the 10-year benchmark Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% was up 2.4 basis points to 2.663%, according to WSJ Market Data Group.\n\nThe 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% was up 1.5 basis point to 2.073%, marking the 14th straight day of yield gains. The 30-year bond rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% was up 1.4 basis point to 2.927%, the highest in close to three months.
U.S. stocks staged a major rally to close out the week, more than erasing Thursday's sharp losses after a better-than-expected jobs report showed employers adding new personnel at a robust pace.\n\nAlso bolstering sentiment were remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% rose 746.94 points, or 3.3%, to 23,433.16, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% advanced 84.05 points, or 3.4%, to 2,531.94. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% advanced 275.35 points, or 4.3%, to 6,738.86.\n\nAt session highs, the Dow rose as much as 832.42 points, the S&P 500 90.16 points, while the Nasdaq surged 297.18 points.\n\nFriday's performance saved markets from what had been the worst start to a year for the Dow and S&P 500 since 2000, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nAfter Friday's close, the Dow is up 0.5% on the year, the S&P 500 1%, while the Nasdaq has advanced 1.6% over the first three trading days of 2019.\n\nWhat's drove the market?\n\nThe U.S. economy added 312,000 new jobs in December, well above expectations for a gain of 182,000, according to a MarketWatch poll of economists. The strong headline number, along with data showing wages grew faster than expected, helped dampen fears that the Federal Reserve is being overly optimistic in its plans to continue raising interest rates in 2019.\n\nInvestor optimism was further reinforced by comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who said during a Friday morning appearance that the jobs report didn't materially increase concerns over rising inflation, while reiterating that the central bank would continue to keep an open mind about how much it will raise interest rates in 2019 and how aggressively it will shrink its balance sheet, based on incoming data about the U.S. and global economy, including recent weakness in equity markets.\n\nRead:Powell signals he's flexible on interest rates but not resigning if Trump asks\n\nThe healthy report comes on the heels of a statement from China's Commerce Ministry confirming that a delegation of U.S. trade officials would meet with their Chinese counterparts Monday and Tuesday, news reports said, marking the first time the two sides have met since President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day trade truce last month.\n\nRead:Stressed-out stock traders face Friday hurdles posed by jobs report, Fed's Powell\n\nSentiment also got a boost after China's central bank on Friday cut the ratio of cash that banks must hold as reserves by 100 basis points, or 1%, according to news reports â€” a move that is seen as a means to help reduce the risk of a sharper slowdown in the world's second largest economy.\n\nAlso adding to optimism in China was a report showing that the Chinese services sector grew at a faster rate in December versus November, while export orders rose at the fastest pace in six months.\n\nSee:U.S. may find ray of light in December jobs report amid gathering economic clouds\n\nStocks fell hard Thursday after Apple cut its revenue guidance, in part citing weakness in China. A round of weak manufacturing survey data out of China, the eurozone and the U.S. added to the gloom. Apple shares fell sharply, posting their biggest one-day percentage drop since 2013 while the overall market drop left the S&P 500 and the Dow with the worst start to a year since 2000.\n\nWhat are the analysts saying?\n\nStocks added to their gains in the immediate wake of Powell's comments because he reiterated that there isn't a set path for future interest rate hikes, Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager with Federated Investments, told MarketWatch.\n\nIt's not that the Fed is here to save the markets from volatility,' he added. But the magnitude of the pullback we've had, around 20%, tells you something about what the market believes about the underlying economy. It would be the height of hubris for Powell to disregard that, and markets are taking solace in Powell's suggestion that monitoring large swings in equity valuations are important part of data dependence, Chiavarone said.\n\nWith job growth and wage growth continuing to beat investor expectations, it makes it very difficult to argue that the Fed should come to a complete halt in hiking interest rates, or that the economy is meaningfully weakening, Willie Delwiche, investment strategist with R.W. Baird, told MarketWatch.\n\nWhile the market has lately reacted negatively to any news that might encourage further rate hikes, Delwiche said, if the Fed is positioned to continue to raise rates in 2019 because the data warrants it, it's not such a scary thing for the stock market.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% shares rebounded, rising 3.9%, following Thursday's 9.9% decline spurred by the company cutting its revenue guidance, citing weaker iPhone sales in China.\n\nShares of Netflix Inc. NFLX, +0.73% closed up 9.1%, after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction list and said a 36% pullback since July presents an attractive buying opportunity.\n\nCoty Inc. COTY, -3.74% shares are up 4.7%, after JPMorgan analyst Andrea Teixeira raised her rating on the stock from sell to neutral, arguing that the beauty-products company's stock has hit a rock bottom valuation. The stock is down more than 49% over the past six months.\n\nHow did other markets trading?\n\nStock markets in China rallied Friday, after news of the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks, new stimulus measures from China's central bank, as well as a better-than-expected report on the Chinese services sector.\n\nBoth the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.17% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng HSI, +0.50% Index gained more than 2%. Japan's Nikkei NIK, +0.18% , however, slid 2.3% after the Tokyo Stock Exchange had been closed for holidays all week.\n\nEuropean stock markets also rallied, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.88% and the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.80% closing solidly in the green.
Chinese authorities put the hurt on currency traders who had bet on a weaker yuan for a second day Thursday. In the process, are they also endangering the strong dollar narrative at the heart of many market forecasts?\n\nThat is the question posed by Kit Juckes, global macro strategist at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale, in a Thursday note. It comes after a new wave of liquidity tightening by China's central bank sent the yuan soaring to its strongest level versus the dollar since mid-November in offshore markets, marking a second straight day of sharp gains.\n\nThe dollar was weaker across the board, losing ground against major rivals including the euro EURUSD, -0.03% and the Japanese yen USDJPY, +0.03% , and triggered the largest one-day drop for the ICE dollar index DXY, +0.41% since June.\n\nA slow grind higher by the dollar versus the yuan USDCNY, is a key element of a market outlook that calls for continued dollar strength, he notes.\n\nIt's not the only argument for a stronger dollar, he acknowledges, as the prospect of U.S. economic outperformance fueled by easier fiscal policy and the implications for Fed policy which contrast so sharply with what the [European Central Bank] and [Bank of Japan] are doing, along with the rise in oil prices and concern about a resurgence in protectionist behavior, may matter more.\n\nBut Juckes notes that the surge higher in short-term, offshore yuan USDCNH, -0.00% rates echoed a move seen around this time last year (see chart below) when tighter liquidity triggered a rally for the yuan and set the stage for the dollar's reverseâ€”a 6% trade-weighted fall between mid-January and early May that was only fully reversed by the presidential election.\n\nBut why are Chinese authorities putting upward pressure on the yuan, at least in the offshore market?\n\nThe move comes after global investors appeared increasingly confident that the Chinese currency was due to weaken further. The Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed government adviser who said the decision to tighten liquidity in the offshore markets was aimed at discouraging investors from piling on bets against the currency.\n\nThe measures follow a tightening of capital controls designed to prevent yuan outflows after data showed a continued fall in China's forex reserves.\n\nThere is plenty of doubt, however, over the durability of the yuan surge. Here's David Rees of Capital Economics, in a Thursday note:\n\nLike last year, though, we doubt that this latest bout of renminbi strength will continue for much longer. After all, the recent rally in the dollar means that the renminbi has appreciated in trade-weighted terms. And with the euro EURUSD, -0.03% and yen USDJPY, +0.03% likely to weaken against the dollar during the course of this year on account of diverging monetary policies in Europe and Japan relative to that in the US, the renminbi would need to weaken against the dollar just to simply tread water in trade-weighted terms. Indeed, given that we forecast the euro to weaken to $0.95/â‚¬ and the yen to head towards Â¥130/$, the renminbi would need to depreciate to around 7.3/$, from 6.89/$ currently, in order to hold its ground in trade-weighted terms (see chart below).\n\nJuckes isn't looking for a sustained rally by the yuan either, describing tighter capital controls as stop-gap measures that may plug one hole but won't prevent another emerging elsewhere.\n\nFurther weakness for the offshore and, more important, the onshore yuan seem inevitable, as well as desirable for the Chinese economy, he wrote. But challenging the market narrative that has seen investors and traders pile into the dollar since early November is enough to trigger a sharp cutback of [dollar] longs, not just in USD/CNH but across G-10 FX until liquidity conditions ease.
We're asking too much of the stock market, and its failures are making us poorer.\n\nThis isn't a gripe about the recent selloff, because the market fails when the S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% is up and when it's down. Specifically, it is failing at three primary functions our society has handed over to the stock market: allocating capital wisely, funding a secure retirement and creating jobs.\n\nCapital allocation: fail\n\nMost of us believe, as economic theory teaches, that a stock market is an efficient way of transferring capital from those who have a little extra money (savers) to those who have good uses for it (entrepreneurs). When we put money into the market, we imagine that our pennies and dollars are funding productive investments in corporations.\n\nEvery year since 1993, nonfinancial corporations have extinguished more capital than has been created from new investment in their shares.\n\nThat's why we call ourselves investors when we open a 401(k) or a brokerage account. But in the vast majority of cases, we aren't actually investing anything at all in the company that only happens when a company sells new shares in an initial or secondary public offering. For most of us, the money we supply to buy shares simply goes to earlier shareholders who sold us our shares. We aren't really investors; we are speculators.\n\nMust read:How the stock market destroyed the middle class\n\nMost of the time, the flow of capital is exactly the opposite of what economic theory suggests. In every year since 1993, more capital has flown from nonfinancial corporations to shareholders than from shareholders to corporations.\n\n 'Listing on a stock market creates pressures against creating employment; market participants seem to reward the lean and mean, and punish the job creators.'  â€” Professor Jerry Davis\n\nIn 2014, for instance, nonfinancial corporations in the aggregate returned $388 billion more to investors than they received in initial or secondary public offerings. Since 1993, the total amount of capital that the market has taken away from corporations is around $5 trillion.\n\nImagine if that $5 trillion had been spent on new factories, new equipment or the development of new intellectual property.\n\nRetirement security: fail\n\nIt used to be that the stock market was almost exclusively for the wealthy. Regular working folk didn't own stocks, but the destruction of defined-benefit pensions and the advent of do-it-yourself retirement savings changed all that. Now, although the top 1% still owns more than a third of all shares, and the top 10% owns more than 80%, about half of Americans own at least a few shares.\n\nThey own shares for one reason: to save for their retirement.\n\nHowever, only a few have enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement. In 2013, the median value of a retirement account for a household headed by someone near retirement was just $24,000. For the poorest half of the population, the median holding was less than $4,000.\n\nInadequate savings is only one problem with relying on the stock market to fund our retirements. A far greater problem with relying on 401(k)s is that the stock market is extremely volatile. That makes it a risky way to save for long-term goals such as retirement. How much money you'll have saved for your golden years depends too much on luck and timing.\n\nJob creation: fail\n\nEver since the Great Recession, policy makers have been searching for easy ways to accelerate job growth. One answer that both Republicans and Democrats agreed on was encouraging the formation of new businesses by giving them access to capital through the stock market, under the assumption that new companies create most of the new jobs. And so the JOBS Act was passed, which makes it easier for new corporations to go public by selling shares to the public.\n\nNew research by Jerry Davis of the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business shows what an utter failure that policy has been. Davis shows that companies that go public create very few jobs. Between 2001 and 2014, 1,600 companies went public with an IPO, but the typical company only increased its employment by 51 jobs after going public.\n\nAccording to Davis, the biggest IPO success story (in terms of organic job growth) since 2001 has been GameStop GME, +1.12% , the videogame retailer that has about 7,000 stores and 54,000 employees, most of them making less than $10 an hour.\n\nGameStop is the new face of job creation in America, Davis said. Not exactly the model we'd like to replicate.\n\nThe largest employers in America used to be huge industrial conglomerates that offered secure, well-paid, lifetime careers. Now the largest employers are retailers such as Wal-Mart WMT, -0.81% , Kroger KR, -1.45% and Home Depot HD, +0.84% , which have high turnover and low wages.\n\nThe structure and governance of American corporations has utterly changed since the 1960s, when the largest companies by revenue were also among the largest employers and had large market capitalizations. For instance, in 1962, AT&T T, +0.12% had the biggest market cap and employed 564,000, while General Motors GM, +2.96% had the second-largest market cap and had 605,000 workers.\n\nThe new paradigm of running corporations solely for the benefit of shareholders coincided with the development of the Internet and other information and communication technologies that dramatically lowered transaction costs. Instead of having vertically integrated companies that produced everything they sold, we saw more corporations that outsourced as much as they could.\n\nThe market richly rewarded companies that slashed costs, especially labor costs. And the trend is accelerating.\n\nBy 2012, employment at the largest companies had plunged. Apple AAPL, -1.84% had the biggest market cap, but had only 76,000 workers.\n\nSo now it's possible to have huge revenues and a large market capitalization without actually having many workers. Contrary to the idea that going public meant the creation of lots of new jobs, companies discovered that if anything, listing on a stock market creates pressures against creating employment; market participants seem to reward the lean and mean, and punish the job creators, Davis wrote.\n\nThe new companies that have recently gone public are even leaner: Facebook FB, -0.53% has fewer than 10,000 workers, and Uber (which is likely to go public soon) has about 2,000 full-time employees (and hundreds of thousands of drivers who supposedly work for themselves).\n\nThere's probably nothing that can be done to force the markets to reward companies that create jobs. But at least we should stop pretending that increasing the number of listed public companies will automatically create more jobs.\n\nIt's time to stop relying so much on the stock market to solve all of our economic problems.
In 2015, a diversified investment portfolio didn't really protect you from the market's gut-wrenching volatility.\n\nThere's a good chance that 2016 will be a repeat, this time with bond funds suffering through a rising-rate environment, stocks struggling against volatility, emerging and international markets offering little help, and cash and money markets offering only near-zero returns.\n\nAs a result, the new year again has investors wondering whether diversification â€” spreading your money into various asset types so that you take on many risks to leave yourself, theoretically, with something always doing well â€” is still worth the effort.\n\nHow to invest, what to avoid, in 2016\n\nThat's especially so in the face of event-driven investing and tactical asset allocation â€” two increasingly popular investment categories that boil down to focusing on what's working or poised to emerge.\n\nDiversification is such bedrock, cornerstone investment policy for the average guy that arguing against it is like saying something bad about apple pie.\n\nFor long-term buy-and-hold investors, putting money in various asset classes â€” domestic and international, large and small companies, bonds, commodities, cash and more â€” tends to instill the peace of mind needed to stay the course through all conditions.\n\nOver time, diversification tends to deliver a smooth ride, even if it doesn't necessarily work during all those times.\n\n2015 was one of the times when diversification appears to have let investors down.\n\nDan Wiener, editor of the Independent Adviser for Vanguard Investors, noted recently that the average Vanguard investor lost money in 2015, due largely to losses in emerging markets and international stocks outweighing small gains for domestic stocks and bonds.\n\nHe noted that the Vanguard Investor Index â€” an asset-weighted measure of the performance of all Vanguard funds and annuities â€” was off in 2015, making it the first time since 2008 that the average Vanguard investor was down. It was just the fifth decline in the last quarter-century.\n\nWhile those numbers show the struggle of diversification in 2015, that long-term picture shows why investors shouldn't be spooked out of the practice.\n\nIt's never the year that diversification works, said Jonathan Clements, a long-time personal-finance writer and author of Money Guide 2016. If you're properly diversified, you will always own the worst-performing part of the market. That is the nature of diversification.\n\nIn an appearance on MoneyLife with Chuck Jaffe, Clements noted that the bad news of owning the market's losers in a broadly diversified portfolio is balanced out by the good news of owning the market's winners.\n\nThe only way to guarantee you're going to capture the market's rise over the long haul is to be diversified, he said. If you are not diversified and you are betting heavily on a few sectors of the market, it's entirely possible that you could suffer lousy returns over a lifetime of investing.\n\nInvestors ready to give up on diversification are surrendering that ability to capture the tendency of the market to rise over time, replacing it with a strategy that assumes they will always be able to identify what's working. They are avoiding the bad news, hoping to generate their own good news by owning what has been on the rise.\n\nThat's a great strategy â€” except most investors simply can't do it.\n\nCountless studies show that investors tend to buy into a rising market only after much of the heat has played out, leaving them vulnerable when the market turns. Effectively, they buy high and sell low, whereas spreading a money into a diversified portfolio â€” and using additional deposits to keep allocations in line with the plan â€” tends to result in buying low, knowing that the strategy will eventually pay off.\n\nMoreover, investors who follow a diversified plan tend to avoid overreacting to fear and greed.\n\nWhile playing to those emotions might look like a winning strategy in any given year, sticking with a long-term methodology tends to be the victor for investors who stay with it.\n\nMarket veteran Bill Nasgovitz of the Heartland Funds noted that investors tend to be best-served by sticking with time-tested methods, rather than changing their tune just because of the market's action for a year â€” or even a decade.\n\nWhatever your methodology, Nasgovitz said, hopefully it helps you handle and weather the extremes of fear and greed, so you don't get excited at the top when everybody else is buying like crazy and, visa versa, you don't get too depressed and sell everything out â€” and we all know people who have, reacting to the past and perhaps making the bottom, because they are fed up and fearful the world is coming to an end.
Millions of social media users strive to take the perfect selfie and yearn to hear those three little words. But can you even believe what you see anymore? CVS CVS, +0.64% said Monday that it will not digitally alter or change a person's shape, size, proportion, skin or eye color or enhance or alter lines, wrinkles or other individual characteristics. It will put a CVS Beauty Mark label on images that have not been airbrushed or altered.\n\nThere's been backlash against photo editors who alter photos to conform to just one idea of what's considered beautiful in recent years, but appears to have picked up steam with the women-led #MeToo movement. Last November, Academy Award-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o criticized Grazia magazine for airbrushing a cover photo of her. The magazine lightened her skin tone and removed some of her hair.\n\nDisappointed that Grazia U.K. edited out and smoothed my hair to fit a more Eurocentric notion of what beautiful hair looks like, Nyong'o tweeted to her 804,000 Twitter TWTR, -4.96% followers last month. An Le, a Vietnamese photographer who took the photo, responded: I realize now what an incredibly monumental mistake I have made and I would like to take this time to apologize to Ms Nyong'o and everyone else that I did offend.\n\nWho is the fairest, youngest and smudgiest of them all? MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto\n\n 'If you're creating a false advertisement of yourself online through airbrushing, the only outcomes are frustration for you â€” when your date isn't interested in the real you â€” and annoyance for the other person who invested their time with a you who doesn't truly exist.'  â€” Abby Rodman, a psychotherapist in Boston\n\nBut more people are applying the methods of the advertising industry to their own lives. Who can blame them? Facebook and dating profiles appear to be echoing what users have been fed by magazines and television advertisements for years. The billion-dollar online dating industry report a surge in membership this time of year. False advertising, like charity, appears to start at home: More people are also using the airbrushing on themselves.\n\nFalse advertising is frustrating and a profile on a dating site is, in essence, an advertisement of you, said Abby Rodman, a psychotherapist in Boston. Too much airbrushing causes problems. If you're creating a 'false advertisement' of yourself online through airbrushing and other means, the only outcomes are frustration for you â€” when your date isn't interested in the real you â€” and annoyance for the other person who invested their time with a you who doesn't truly exist.\n\nA smudge, smudge here and a smudge, smudge there have never been easier. Adobe Photoshop once charged hundreds of dollars. It now charges just $9.99 a month for its most basic package. It must compete with a slew of easy-to-use apps: MoreBeaute2, is free on Apple's AAPL, -3.39% iOS and suggests removing freckles from children's photos; BeautyPlus, free on iOS and Android, actually advertises a skin lightening feature. Call it Facetune 2: Revenge of the nerds. Anyone can have abs â€” online, at least. ABSmatic costs $1 on iOS.\n\nAirbrushing and other photo-trickery, once the preserve of Hollywood studios, is available to anyone with a smartphone and the ability to smudge, and they are altering our perceptions of what is deemed beautiful. In addition to the usual overly smudged faces â€” that appear to be fooling no one â€” and white teeth reminiscent of Hollywood's Golden Age, many promote Western and Caucasian features as the norm. There is no room for natural blemishes or aging with these apps.\n\nFacebook Pursues Positive Vibes\n\nThe stakes have just risen with higher expectations and deeper letdowns when your man takes off his shirt and his abs turn out to have been painted, said Fran Walfish, a Beverly Hills, Calif.-based psychotherapist.

Dear Moneyologist,\n\nMy husband and I married last year. This is a second marriage for each of us. I have two adult age children and he has two minor children. In his divorce decree it states that he shall maintain a $300,000 life insurance for his children as beneficiary until they reach the age of 23. However, on the actual policy he only has me listed as beneficiary. There is nothing indicating that this is left for his children should he pass prior to them reaching age 23. What would the legal liability be on this if he should pass before me?\n\nAm I legally obligated to turn this over to the children because it states it in his divorce? There is no written will at this time indicating anything for his children.\n\nDiane\n\nDear Diane,\n\nLife insurance is regarded as non-probate, provided there is a named beneficiary. But even without a will, the divorce decree still matters.\n\nThis is not the first time a reader has suggested giving step-relatives the short shrift when it comes to inheritance. In November, Elsee in Vancouver, Wash., wrote to the Moneyologist to say that her late mother had effectively cut her step grandchildren out of her will before she died by transferring assets beyond the reach of probate, even though her mother's late husband wanted to divide his estate between Elsee and his grandchildren. In this case, she could have kept the lot. But I advised her to divide it.\n\nIf you wanted to become beneficiary of your husband's life insurance policy after he's gone, you would likely win the battle (the payout from the life insurance) but lose the war ($300,000 from your husband's estate). The divorce decree places the obligation on your husband to maintain the life insurance policy, says John Slowiaczek, president-elect at the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and an attorney based in Omaha, Neb., and even with you as the beneficiary on his policy, he would likely be in contempt of court. His children could make a claim of $300,000 against his estate, if he died with you as his beneficiary on that policy.\n\nListen to our new podcast:Money, Markets & More (or subscribe on iTunes): Walking a mile in dead men's shoes and Millennials tap home equity for frivolities.\n\nThis kind of case is pretty common, Slowiaczek says. He's seen many cases over the years where the second wife doesn't want the first wife or first wife's family to have anything. They want it all. Often times, the men don't want to fight with their new wives. But changing a life insurance policy that goes against the terms of the divorce decree would be asking for trouble. He would likely be in contempt of court, he adds, and that could get ugly. Sticking it to the ex-wife is one thing, he adds, but changing the terms of this policy would be trying to stick it to the children.\n\n If you wanted to become beneficiary of your husband's life insurance policy after he's gone, you would likely win the battle, but lose the war ($300,000 from your husband's estate). The divorce decree places the obligation on your husband to maintain the life insurance policy.  â€” The Moneyologist\n\nStill, you wouldn't be the first second wife to want to claim a life insurance policy that was written for her husband's first family. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a 66-year-old man's ex-wife (rather than his widow) as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth over $124,000. In this case, he may not have wanted his ex-wife, who he divorced 10 years before his death, to claim his life insurance policy. But with or without a divorce decree, the document given to the insurance company had his ex-wife's name on it.\n\nIn many cases, there is financial chaos among warring children when a parent dies without leaving a will, especially if one child has been quietly working their way into the parent's finances. Case in point: S. in Virginia wrote a letter to say she had discovered that her father had died without leaving a will and, even though he wanted to split his estate between his children, her father had accidentally made her sister an owner of his bank account, not just a signatory, meaning she owned the money in that bank account. Nice work, if you can get it.\n\nYou appear to be flirting with the idea of going head-to-head with your husband's children over his life insurance policy, should he die before his children reach the age of 23. That's a move that would make you $300,000 richer. Of course, he could also write a will to say he wants you to have the loot. But if a will did exist, some state courts have ruled that life insurance contracts honor the divorce decree rather than the will. The takeaway? People should be clear about their wishes and put them down on paper, and not rely on the goodwill of others to do the right thing after they're gone.\n\nIt's more likely that you're out of luck and out of $300,000.\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

It really is hard to believe. Here is the U.K. government, negotiating with Europe's leaders over nothing less than Britain's future arrangements with Europe, without having put any serious analysis or assessment before the public.\n\nMoreover, in 2016 Britons will be voting, assuming that the government adopts the Electoral Commission's wording on Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union? On what basis will they be making up their minds?\n\nBefore deciding whether the U.K. should join the euro, the government undertook a multi-volume study: the five tests of the pros and cons of fixed-currency arrangements. Viewed through the lens of hindsight, the study's overall conclusion â€” that the case for U.K. membership had not been made, and that a decision to join would not be in the national economic interest â€” has served the U.K. well.\n\nDon't miss:Through fresh eyes, the U.K is not a pretty sight\n\nIf such a thorough study was the right way to proceed then, surely it would be appropriate today to provide a thorough, transparent analysis of what is potentially an even bigger issue. This could be of importance not only to the U.K. public, but also, arguably, to the development of policy thinking in Europe.\n\nWhat the U.K. badly needs, indeed has needed for more than 50 years, is a vision, a strategy that defines how the U.K. should see itself, and its place, in the modern world. The government's recent underplayed Review of the Balance of Competences could be a component: but what is really required is a global framework in which the U.K.'s future relationship with Europe can be considered.\n\nThis would, in turn, provide a basis for considering what the U.K. can do to further its interests by influencing developments abroad, region by region, bloc by bloc.\n\nGlobal strategy is needed\n\nOther countries have had to do this â€” Australia and New Zealand, for example, when in the 1970s the U.K. progressively scaled back its food imports from them under pressure from the European Economic Community. The British may be instinctively suspicious of grand visions; but some sort of framework of thought is necessary.\n\nA realistic first step would be to ditch any lingering nostalgic belief that the U.K. has a special relationship with the U.S. The U.K. is, of course, able to wield some influence, from time to time, in specific areas; but there is no escaping the basic fact that the U.K. oday accounts for just 2.5% of global gross domestic product.\n\nEqually, the U.K. should not pin undue hopes on China. Yes, China has many people; has had a fast-growing economy; has a lot of borrowable savings; and so on. But the U.K. is not important to China; and nor is the U.K. likely to be able to influence it.\n\nThe best that the U.K. can do in respect of these two great blocs is to maintain correct relationships with them, within the international framework of law and order.\n\nSo what of that one remaining big bloc, Europe? Europe will always have a special importance for the U.K. It is its nearest neighbour; its biggest trading partner; its closest cultural companion; its unavoidable defence collaborator.\n\nThe U.K. therefore has a particularly strong interest in seeing a Europe that is politically stable, outwardly oriented, militarily secure, and economically prosperous. True, it has a similar interest in respect of both the U.S. and China. But the difference as regards Europe is that, potentially at least, the U.K. can exert some influence.\n\nIn many ways, it is this recognition that has underpinned the U.K.'s postâ€“World War II policy of constructive engagement. Notwithstanding an initial reluctance to join the EEC, the U.K. helped to foster the development of modern institutions in Germany. It supported the 1970s democratisation of Spain, Portugal, and Greece and, ultimately, the unification of Germany.\n\nIt has committed itself firmly to Nato â€” more so than idiosyncratic France or hesitant Germany. It has championed the role of markets and free trade. It has encouraged economic reform, not least the development of the single market.\n\nThis policy has, on the whole, served Britain well, as it has Europe and the EU. And to some extent this continues. British Commissioner Lord Hill, for example, is doing a creditable job championing a Capital Markets Union.\n\nMore important, however, will be whether the EU moves on to develop the open market for services in the way that was done earlier for goods. Securing a free market for trade in services is already important; and that importance grows by the day as the weight of the services sector in today's world increases. And it matters even more to the U.K., with its particularly large financial services sector.\n\nInfluential presence\n\nWielding influence in Europe is not yet a lost cause. There is respect in Europe for Britain for its past contributions; for its commitment to democracy; for its understanding of, and place in, world markets; for the competence of its military.\n\nBut being able to push major matters such as the development of the single market to a successful conclusion will require credible and persuasive analysis; a strong voice within; and the support of many.\n\nBritain is well able to develop such an analysis. Conducted seriously, and delivered with humility, it would meet the domestic need, and could well be welcomed on the continent. But first that case has to be made. Only then would Prime Minister David Cameron be right to negotiate; and he would be wrong to press his case by threatening to leave.\n\nAt this crucial juncture for Britain and Europe, the question has to be asked: where is the successor thinking to that of Winston Churchill and Ernest Bevin? In short, where is the vision?\n\nThis op-ed previously appeared at eFinancialNews.com and in the Financial News print edition dated Jan. 4.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.31% has cut corporate staffers in its Bentonville, Ark. headquarters across areas like human resources and real estate, the company confirmed on Friday. As many as 500 were cut, and most workers were notified on Thursday. As we've previously stated, we've been looking at our structure for some time as we explore ways to operate more effectively, the company said in a statement. The company will promote more than 360 associates into positions with higher responsibility, a Wal-Mart spokesperson said. These positions will be in focus areas for the company, like its expansion in online grocery. Workers that were laid off will be paid for up to 60 days as they search for a new job, and Wal-Mart will provide outplacement services, resume skills training, and other counseling through its employee assistance program. After 60 days, workers who did not find another job will be offered a severance package that's based on company policy, their position and length of service. Eligible workers will also receive a fiscal year-end incentive. Wal-Mart shares are up nearly 61% for the past year while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 31.3% for the period.
Oil futures ended lower on Monday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, together known as OPEC+, failed to reach an agreement on production policy and said they plan to resume talks on Tuesday. The majority of OPEC+ favor a rollover of current output levels, but Russia and Kazakhstan want to see an increase of 500,000 barrels per day in February, according to a tweet from Amena Bakr, deputy bureau chief and chief OPEC correspondent at Energy Intelligence. February West Texas Intermediate crude clg21 fell 90 cents, or nearly 1.9%, to settle at $47.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
NEW HAVEN, Conn. (Project Syndicate) â€” Speculative markets have always been vulnerable to illusion. But seeing the folly in markets provides no clear advantage in forecasting outcomes, because changes in the force of the illusion are difficult to predict.\n\nIn the United States, two illusions have been important recently in financial markets. One is the carefully nurtured perception that President-elect Donald Trump is a business genius who can apply his deal-making skills to make America great again.\n\nThe other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of Dow 20,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has been above 19,000 since November, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier, which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published. Whatever happens, Dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.\n\nTrump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president. Tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices. Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).\n\n The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming. \n\nBut it is not just Trump's proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology. The U.S. has never had a president like him. Not only is he an actor, like Ronald Reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker. If he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.\n\nThe closest we can come to Trump among former U.S. presidents might be Calvin Coolidge, an extremely pro-business tax cutter. The chief business of the American people is business, Coolidge famously declared, while his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon â€” one of America's wealthiest men â€” advocated tax cuts for the rich, which would trickle down in benefits to the less fortunate.\n\nThe U.S. economy during the Coolidge administration was very successful, but the boom ended badly in 1929, just after Coolidge stepped down, with the stock market crash and the beginning of the Great Depression. During the 1930s, the 1920s were looked upon wistfully, but also as a time of fakery and cheating.\n\nOf course, history is never destiny, and Coolidge is only one observation â€” hardly a solid basis for a forecast. Moreover, unlike Trump, both Coolidge and Mellon were level-headed and temperate in their manner.\n\nBut add to the Trump effect all the attention paid to Dow 20,000, and we have the makings of a powerful illusion. On Nov. 10, 2016, two days after Donald J. Trump was elected, the Dow Jones average hit a new record high, and has since set 16 more daily records, all trumpeted by news media.\n\nThat sounds like important news for Trump. In fact, the Dow had already hit nine record highs before the election, when Hillary Clinton was projected to win. In nominal terms, the Dow is up 70% from its peak in January 2000. On Nov. 29, 2016, it was announced that the S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (which I co-founded with my late colleague Karl E. Case) reached a record high the previous September. The previous record was set more than ten years earlier, in July 2006.\n\nWill augmented reality or virtual reality win?\n\nBut these numbers are illusory. The U.S. has a national policy of overall inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve has set an inflation objective of 2% in terms of the personal consumption expenditure deflator. This means that all prices should tend to go up by about 2% per year, or 22% per decade.\n\nThe Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that Case and I created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms. But hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.\n\nThe Fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation â€” price stability, not zero inflation â€” appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.\n\nMany people appear not to understand that inflation is a change in the units of measurement. Unfortunately, although the 2% inflation target is largely a feel-good policy, people tend to draw too much inspiration from it. Irving Fisher called this fixation on nominal price growth the money illusion in an eponymous 1928 book.\n\nThat doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. Stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. And random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. But once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records â€“ probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.\n\nIn the U.S., the combination of Trump and a succession of new asset-price records â€” call it Trump-squared â€” has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism. For those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception, one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.\n\nRobert J.

There was nothing like a couple of limit-down, circuit-breaker-tripping trading days last week in China to seemingly send shock waves through global financial markets, making for the worst-ever start to a new year for U.S. equities. Or was there?\n\nCarl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, takes a contrary view, noting that what happens in Shanghai has tended to have very little to do with what happens in New York. And he has the charts to back it up (see below).
The stock market is in the midst of its longest winning streak in months, but at least one Wall Street strategist is not convinced that investors are out of the woods yet.\n\nMike Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, who had urged caution even as stocks were trading at records last year, reiterated his downbeat outlook on the market.\n\nWe are definitely more constructive than we have been in over a year based on valuation, sentiment, and positioning, but we don't think it is time to blow the all-clear yet, he said in a report.\n\nWilson believes the market is too damaged and there is too much resistance for stocks to climb straight up. He also noted that financial conditions continue to deteriorate despite the Fed's more dovish tone, and without the central bank backing off from its tighter policy regime, it will be tough for the market to support a rally above 2,600-2,650.\n\nRead: Fed minutes show dissention over December interest-rate hike\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% has been whiplashing in the past couple of weeks as trade-war related headlines, speculation over the Fed's policy stance and economic data have played havoc with market sentiment. In perhaps the most dramatic sign of what investors are having to contend with, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% went from having the worst start to a year since 2000 on Jan. 3 to posting year-to-date gains of more than 3% Wednesday.\n\nAgainst this rather topsy-turvy backdrop, Wilson argues that it is premature to be too positive about equities as the market has yet to trough.\n\nBefore making the call for the market to move sustainably higher, we think there are still a few more hurdles to clear, he said. Ultimately, we expect a very important cyclical low to this bear market to be put in this year, and we expect a reversal of our rolling bear market to occur in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner with the weakest links bottoming first and leading.\n\nAs such, cyclical stocks â€” such as automobile makers, restaurants and airlines â€” which are more sensitive to the economy, are expected to lead when the market hits bottom.\n\nFurthermore, Wilson said that although the rolling bear market has worked its way through on the index and sector level, there is still room for valuations to fall among individual stocks as well as potential for further earnings cuts, such as Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +1.27% revenue warning last week.\n\nWe suspect there are more 'Apples' looming out there as we enter fourth-quarter earnings season, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, equity risk premium has risen to levels not seen since 2016, thanks in part to a decline in yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.625% trading at 2.73% versus its 2018 peak of above 3%.\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nThe strategist is projecting the S&P 500 to rise to 2,750 by the end of 2019, among the more subdued forecasts.\n\nWe like the S&P 500 at current levels for those with a 12-month horizon, but we think there is a good chance we test or break recent lows as we experience a rolling bottom for individual stocks, particularly those that have high index weightings, he said.\n\nU.S. stocks gained for a fourth straight session Wednesday as optimism over U.S.-China trade talks bolstered market confidence.
Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have defeated Georgia's two incumbent Republican U.S. senators in the state's runoff elections, the Associated Press said Wednesday, in a development that gives their party effective control of the Senate.\n\nOssoff and Warnock were projected the winners over Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler by the AP following campaigns that drew massive spending and worldwide attention because the runoffs were set to determine the balance of power in Washington. The AP called the race for Warnock over Loeffler first, at about 2 a.m. Eastern, then followed with the call for Ossoff over Perdue on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration and the Democratic-run House of Representatives now won't face the same checks on their policy priorities that they would have faced with a Republican-controlled Senate, though analysts have said the slim Democratic majority in the chamber could mean more power for moderate senators from either party.\n\nSee: With sweep expected in Georgia Senate races, Democrats have high hopes for what Biden can do\n\nRepublicans controlled 50 seats in the Senate following November's elections and would have remained the majority party in the 100-seat chamber with just one win in Georgia. But instead Democrats picked up two seats and now are set to run the Senate as a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, will cast tie-breaking votes.\n\nIt is looking like the Democratic campaign machine was more effective at driving turnout than the Republican one, said Eurasia Group analyst Jon Lieber in a note late Tuesday.\n\nWarnock, who will be the first Black senator in his state's history, delivered video-streamed remarks after midnight that contained some hallmarks of a victory speech. Loeffler also spoke, insisting she still had a path to victory.\n\nWarnock then made comments on CNN just before 8 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.\n\nI'm deeply honored that the people of Georgia have placed their trust in someone who grew up in public housing â€” one of 12 children, I'm No. 11, the first college graduate in my family, the Democrat said. I hope to bring the concerns of ordinary people to the United States Senate.\n\nOssoff's campaign manager said in a late-night statement that when all the votes are counted, we fully expect that Jon Ossoff will have won this election to represent Georgia in the United States Senate. Perdue's campaign issued a statement calling the election exceptionally close and said it would exhaust every legal recourse to ensure that all ballots are counted.\n\nAround 8 a.m. Eastern on Wednesday, Ossoff essentially gave a victory speech in live-streamed remarks.\n\nIt is with humility that I thank the people of Georgia for electing me to serve you in the United States Senate, the Democrat said. I'll be for you in the U.S. Senate. I will serve all the people of the state.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average YMH21, +0.22% shot higher after the race was called overnight for Warnock, and U.S. stocks DJIA, +0.58% SPX, +0.29% closed mostly higher on Wednesday. The 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.663% , meanwhile, rose above 1%.\n\nIn the short term, Democratic control of the Senate almost certainly means more COVID-related fiscal support, said Stephen Stanleyâ€‹, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, in a note Wednesday.\n\nIn particular, Democrats (with the support of a number of Republicans) will push for expanding the most recent round of rebate checks from $600 to $2,000, which would mean another $350 billion or so of money flowing into household coffers, on top of the roughly $160 billion that is already on its way (the $600 checks).\n\nBut Stanley said that further out, the incoming Biden administration could struggle to win very many legislative victories on controversial bills given the razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress.\n\nRelated: Biden says Democratic wins in Georgia's runoffs will lead to $2,000 stimulus checks\n\nAlso read: Wall Street refused to believe the Georgia polls. Now there's a big rotation under way\n\nBefore polls closed Tuesday in the Georgia races, betting markets and polls had signaled some confidence in the Democratic candidates' prospects.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon will receive $28 million in total compensation for 2016, up 3.7% â€” or $1 million â€” from 2015, according to a Thursday securities filing.\n\nThe chairman and chief executive's pay package includes $21.5 million in performance-related restricted stock and $5 million in cash. His base salary is unchanged at $1.5 million, according to the filing. The total compensation is up from his 2015 pay package of $27 million.
Gold futures finish lower Thursday after failing to overcome resistance at the psychologically important $1,300-an-ounce level, but remained on track for a modest weekly gain as a result of overall softness in the dollar.\n\nFebruary gold US:GCG9 fell by $4.60, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,287.40 an ounce after trading as high as $1,298. The yellow metal was up a modest 0.1% in the week to date and has climbed 0.5% so far in January, according to FactSet data. March US:SIH9 fell 9.2 cents, or 0.6%, to fetch $15.643 an ounce.\n\nAnalysts said movements in the U.S. dollar continue to be among the biggest factors for gold, with the currency in turn taking its cue from expectations around the Federal Reserve's rate plans. The dollar has weakened this month on expectations the Fed will be less aggressive than previously thought in tightening monetary policy.\n\nRead:Fed chatter confirms interest rates on hold until May at earliest\n\nOn Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell again stressed that the central bank is flexible and patient and can change policy on a dime if the economic outlook worsens. He also said the forecast of two interest-rate increases in 2019 was conditional on a very strong outlook for 2019.\n\nMeanwhile, gold prices failed to reach $1,300 overnight and the dollar paring its losses has seen [gold] lose its edge again today, but I think this will only be temporary, said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda, in an email update. Risk appetite improving may slow the ascent, but I don't think it will prevent it as long as the dollar remains soft, as expected.\n\nFor now, the dollar saw a respite from recent selling pressure, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, up 0.4%. The gauge was still off 0.6% so far in the new year.\n\nA weaker dollar can be a positive for commodities priced in the U.S. unit, making them less expensive to buyers using other currencies. Conversely, a stronger dollar can weigh on prices.\n\nIt seems the one constant in gold pricing throughout last year that continues to this day is that dollar strength or weakness has been the strongest force affecting its movement, wrote analyst Gary Wagner of The Gold Forecast, in a Thursday post.\n\nIn other metals trading, March copper US:HGH9 lost 0.7% at $2.638 a pound, while April platinum US:PLJ9 gained 0.1% to $826.10 an ounce.\n\nMarch palladium US:PAH9 rose $3.80, or 0.3%, to $1,273.20 an ounce, with prices stretching streak of session gains to mark a fifth straight record settlement.
Happy Women's Equality Day! From paid maternity leave to raises for minimum wage workers, several new state and local laws that go into effect this year will directly impact women workers.\n\nIt's a really exciting time, said Andrea Johnson, senior counsel for state policy at the National Women's Law Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for women's equality. Progress has been stalled in Congress and at the federal level, but things have really been happening at the state level.\n\nAs the Trump administration has rolled back laws meant to promote equal pay for men and women and taken aim at federal discrimination protections such as Title IX, states are moving to fill the gaps, Johnson said.\n\nIt's not just blue states like California and New York that are taking action. Mississippi has been considering a law to address pay disparities between men and women, Johnson said. It's not only about women, it's about their families, too. It's incredibly important to overall economic well-being and it's really exciting to see states stepping up.\n\nEmployers, especially those that do business in multiple states, should stay up to date on these new laws to make sure they're not running afoul of new regulations, Ilyse Schuman, an attorney with the global employment law firm Littler, told MarketWatch. (Schuman is now senior vice president of health policy with the American Benefits Council.) Those that are operating in multiple jurisdictions are trying to figure out how to navigate that increasingly complex terrain, Schuman said.\n\nHere's a look at new laws that have recently gone into effect.\n\nSexual harassment protections for freelancers\n\nMore than one-third of the American workforce are freelancers and independent contractors and they're expected to be the majority by 2027, according to the Freelancers Union. But in most states, they have no recourse if they want to take action against a sexual harasser. That's because protections against workplace harassment fall under federal anti-discrimination laws that only cover full-time employees. In April 2018, New York became the latest state to extend sexual harassment protections to freelance workers and contractors.\n\nMany freelancers are unaware that they're not protected by anti-harassment laws in most states, and New York's new statutes represent a significant gain for those workers, said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality and senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center. If they were harassed by an employee, a customer or a vendor, they had no recourse, and there was no way for them to seek justice for what happened, and now they do, Raghu said. Knowing that you have protections in the law will empower more people to come forward if they've been sexually harassed and to take action.\n\nMinimum wage increases\n\nAlmost two-thirds of minimum wage workers in the U.S. are women, according to the National Women's Law Center and, in 18 states, they're about to get raises. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and hasn't increased since 2009. A woman with two children working full-time at that rate would live near or below the poverty line in nearly every state, according to a 2017 analysis by NWLC.\n\nIn California, the minimum wage went up 50 cents an hour starting Jan. 1, 2018 to $11 an hour. In some Bay Area and Silicon Valley cities where income inequality has soared, the minimum wage will shoot up to $15 an hour. Increases are also happening in Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, and, later this year, in New York City.\n\nAll told the new laws will create an additional $5 billion in annual wages for 4.5 million workers nationwide, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit Washington, D.C think tank.\n\nTime off for domestic violence and stalking victims\n\nIn Nevada, employers will be required to provide time off (either paid or unpaid) to domestic violence victims and in New York City, paid sick leave will be expanded to include time off for victims of sexual offenses and stalking starting in May. Nevada employees can use the leave to do things like get counseling, go to court or go to the doctor.\n\nPaid time off when you have a baby, adopt or care for a family member\n\nThe sorry state of U.S. maternity leave is a rude awakening for legions of new working mothers, who are generally shocked to learn that if their employer offers any sort of maternity leave, it often follows the federal Family and Medical Leave Act â€” 12 weeks of leave with no pay at all.\n\nBut for both men and women in New York state, that's about to change. As of last year, employees who work at least 20 hours a week at private employers will get 50% of their salaries, capped at $652 a week, for eight weeks when they need time to bond with a new baby or adopted child or care for a sick relative. Employees will be eligible for more pay and more time off as the law expands over the next few years. By 2021, employees will receive 67% of their salary for up to 12 weeks. New York follows in the footsteps of California, New Jersey and Rhode Island, the only other states to require paid family leave.\n\nSee also: How stay-at-home moms can get credit for diaper changes on their rÃ©sumÃ©s\n\nQuestions about salary history won't be allowed anymore\n\nEmployers of all sizes won't be allowed to ask job applicants about their salary history in California, and starting on July 1, 2018 in San Francisco, employers won't be allowed to give out salary information about current or former employees without written permission. Delaware enacted a similar law in December 2017, and New York City banned questions about pay history starting on Oct. 31, 2017.\n\nWorker advocates have hailed the laws as a step toward achieving equal pay for women and men.\n\nIt's the dreaded question in the interview process because we all know it's often a very unfair question to ask, Johnson said. When we take a step back and look at it, it's forcing women to take pay disparity with them from job to job.\n\nBut some employers are skeptical about the laws. In a survey of 108 businesses by executive search firm Korn Ferry, two-thirds said they thought the new laws would do little to change differences in pay, the Washington Post reported.\n\nEqual pay for equal work\n\nAs of July 2018, Massachusetts employers were not allowed to pay employees of different genders lesser amounts for the same jobs. Puerto Rico enacted a similar law in March 2018. They join many other states with similar laws on the books.\n\nThe Massachusetts law is considered the strongest in the country, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee the immediate end of women earning less than men for the same work, the Boston Globe reported. However, the new law is designed to create transparency around salaries and the skill levels involved in specific jobs, which could help solve pay gaps in the long run, according to the Globe.\n\nMore predictable work schedules\n\nLarger employers (those with 500 or more workers) in Oregon's retail, hospitality and food services sectors were obliged to give new hires more specific information about their work schedules and warn employees about upcoming schedule changes as of July 2018. New York City enacted similar laws for fast food and retail workers starting in November 2017.\n\nThe laws are aimed at providing stability to low wage workers, particularly women, who struggle to balance work and family demands when their work hours constantly change. However, one study found that the laws can have unintended consequences: San Francisco employers hired fewer part-time workers after one such law went into effect, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers\n\nIn Massachusetts, businesses will be required to accommodate the needs of pregnant women and mothers who need to pump breast milk. In Vermont, employers won't be allowed to refuse to accommodate employees with pregnancy-related conditions. There are now about 22 states that have laws protecting pregnant workers, Johnson noted. You have people across party lines coming together and seeing this as a common sense common ground issue, because we all want women to have healthy pregnancies and to be able to provide for their families, Johnson said.\n\n(This story was updated on Aug. 26, 2019.)
Before adjourning for the year, the House passed a measure that would increase the amount of stimulus checks Americans receive from $600 for an individual earning under $75,000 a year to $2,000. President Donald Trump also issued support for higher checks, but the enthusiasm failed to carry over into the Senate â€” and that's good news, according to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.\n\nIt is far from clear what problem would be solved with universal checks reaching 94% of the population, Summers said, referring to $2,000 stimulus checks, which according to one estimate would benefit 94% of U.S. households.\n\nAlso see: Former Obama economist questions wisdom of stimulus checks\n\nThat's because as it stands Americans have been maintaining disposable income levels that are 15% higher than it normally would be relative to the scale of the economy, Summers said during a presentation Monday at the Allied Social Science Associations' annual meeting. Meaning that increasing the amount of stimulus checks likely would not induce an overwhelming increase in spending, he added.\n\nLast week, Summers referred to the possibility of $2,000 checks as a pretty serious mistake that could end up causing the U.S. economy to overheat.\n\nThere is no solution to the inequality or the macroeconomic distress associated with COVID that does not run dominantly through containing COVID and putting it in the rearview mirror, he said, and that needs to be the overwhelming priority for expenditures.\n\nJohn Taylor, a Stanford University economist, agreed with Summers, saying that the $2,000 check issue doesn't really solve the problem of getting the U.S. out of the current recession.\n\nGoing forward, he argued that economic policy makers ought to consider the rising debt levels in the U.S. It'd be better if we find a way, conducive with the private sector growth, to constrain fiscal policy, Taylor, a former Treasury Department official, said.
President Donald Trump said privately several times last year that he wanted to withdraw the U.S. from NATO, the New York Times reported Monday night. Citing senior administration officials, the Times said the idea was expressed around the tumultuous NATO summit last summer in Brussels, with Trump saying he didn't see the point of the U.S. belonging to NATO. Sources told the Times that they worry Trump could again seek to withdraw from NATO now that the calming influence of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is gone and as European military spending continues to lag. Experts told the Times that withdrawing from NATO would be a catastrophe for U.S. foreign policy, sabotaging 70 years of U.S. efforts and handing a huge victory to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly sought to undermine NATO.
And just like that, the bulls came charging back.\n\nAll it took was one stellar economic data point to change the stock market's mood and punt the indexes higher. But even before the robust jobs numbers exorcised the demons, strategists had started to predict that the market is gearing up for a comeback given the depth of the recent selloff.\n\nWe expect a bear market rally to develop over the coming weeks, and we expect a new bull market to develop over the coming months to quarters, said Ari Wald, a technical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.\n\nWald believes the recent spate of weakness is the cyclical bear market waking up in the midst of a secular bull market and suggested that the selling pressure will soon work itself out.\n\nOppenheimer & Co.\n\nOn average, the index drops 20% over an 8-month period and retraces 50% of the prior advance, he said. This is why we believe the S&P 500 has endured the bulk of the magnitude and now requires time to base.\n\nThe strategist forecast the S&P 500 to trade in a range of 2,375 to 2,700 for 2019.\n\nThe stock market closed out the first week of 2019 on a positive note, with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% rising 1.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% climbing 1.6% and the Nasdaq COMP, +0.09% rallying 2.3%, thanks to the strong jobs data which assuaged concerns of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and laid to rest fears about a looming recession.\n\nTobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citi, who trimmed his 2019 target for the S&P 500 to 2,850 from 3,000, believes this is a good time to jump back into the market, in part given that stocks have the potential to rise 16% over the next 12 months on valuations alone.\n\nSince the S&P 500's record high in September, the large-cap index has tumbled double digits, making stocks much more affordable.\n\nNothing is guaranteed, but the data suggest that we should be buying into current weakness, he said.\n\nAside from affordability, there are other encouraging signs, according to strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe bank's Bull & Bear Indicator fell to 1.8, indicating extreme bear, triggering a buy signal for risky assets like stocks for the first time since June 2016 when markets were battered by Brexit headlines.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nHistorically, global stocks rose 6.1% in the three months following each of the buy signals triggered going back to 2000.\n\nThe next two critical signs to watch for are policy panic and a deterioration in profit expectations from the current 7.5% growth.\n\nTommy Ricketts, investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, characterized policy panic as when central banks, especially the Federal Reserve, are unnerved enough by the financial markets to abandon their hawkish stance.\n\nMarkets require a dovish pause at the very least, he said.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThat is a bold call to make in light of the blowout jobs report which has again raised expectations for the central bank to follow through on its interest-rate-hike agenda even as Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated Friday that the Fed will remain flexible.\n\nRead: Jobs report shows the Fed is not done raising interest rates as market prices out a cut\n\nMeanwhile, Ricketts thinks earnings outlooks still remain too lofty.\n\nWe expect profit expectations to reset to 0-5% for 2019 driven by weak Asian exports, yield curve inversion, contracting monetary supply, he said.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts have lowered their S&P 500 earnings estimate by 3.8% to $40.93 a share, significantly above the average cut of 3.1% over the past five years, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.\n\nFourth-quarter earnings are expected to start trickling in next week with Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, -4.57% , Target Corp. TGT, -0.49% , Lennar Corp. LEN, -1.49% , and KB Home KBH, -0.59% in the spotlight.\n\nOn the economic front, investors will have a slew of data to digest including the December ISM nonmanufacturing index, weekly jobless claims and the consumer price index.\n\n-â€”Chris Matthews contributed to this report
PHILADELPHIA (MarketWatch) â€” The economic outlook, if not the weather, was sunny in Philadelphia this weekend, where the economics profession gathered for its annual conference and job fair.\n\nFederal Reserve officials appearing here chose to spend little time stressing the positives like low unemployment and eight years of slow-but-steady economic growth.\n\nInstead, officials started a serious conversation about what new tools they might need to combat the next downturn. The issue is likely going to be at the top of the agenda for new Fed chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nWhenever the economy stumbles, it is taken pretty much as a given by economists here that the Fed will have to slash interest rates back to zero.\n\nThat means it may also have to restart quantitative easing, or asset purchases, that was so unpopular on Main Street and in Congress. This prospect causes some heartburn, so the central bank is casting around for new ideas.\n\nThe Fed knows it will probably revisit the zero lower bound sometime in the future and it is a matter of prudent planning to shore up their tool kit now, said Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives.\n\nYou couldn't pick a better moment for advance planning with the U.S. and global economies humming along and normalization well under way, she said.\n\nIn comments to reporters following a speech at the conference, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said he thought it was a worthwhile debateâ€¦of what should be our objective going forward.\n\nThere are a lot of options and we really need to think about those, he said.\n\nOn the table is a strange-sounding policy called price-level targeting or raising its 2% inflation target to 4%.\n\nWe, not just the Fed but the economics profession, need to have a pretty healthy debate about this. I think that would be healthy to have a very active and open debate about the pros and cons of each alternative, Harker said.\n\n'I'm quite open-minded about this, he added.\n\nAt the moment, the Fed targets an inflation rate. Under price-level targting, the Fed would target the level of prices. If the price level is low for a time, the Fed would need to allow inflation to run hot to get back to the price-level target.\n\nThe underlying idea is to convince the market that the Fed won't be raising interest rates at the first sign of recovery, said Mark Gertler, economics professor at New York University.\n\nMany times in the wake of the most recent financial crisis, investors thought a Fed rate hike might be imminent and pushed up long-term interest rates. This threatened the fragile recovery. In the end, the Fed held rates at zero for seven years.\n\nIn a separate speech at the conference, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said she was open to studying new policy frameworks but said they all have downsides as well as upsides\n\nShe noted that price-level targeting depends on the public's understanding the policy but also believing that future Fed officials would follow through, even in difficult times when the policy would call for higher rates to bring inflation down even if demand was weak.\n\nFormer Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has suggested that temporary price-level targeting might be the answer and only use the policy at the lower bound.\n\nRead: Bernanke proposes temporary price-level targeting\n\nBut Mester said the drawback of this hybrid approach was that switching away from price-level targeting would be a complex process.\n\nMester, and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard in a separate speech, agreed with Harker that study of these new tools was appropriate.\n\nA move in this direction would require considerable debate and reflection, but might also confer substantial benefits to the U.S. economy if it could be implemented effectively, Bullard said.
With the New Year here and a Democratic-controlled Senate looking increasingly likely after the runoff Senate elections in Georgia, President-elect Joe Biden's tax plans are unlikely to suffer from any lack of bipartisan support.\n\nAccording to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an independent, non-profit, bipartisan public-policy organization based in Washington, D.C. that examines federal budget and fiscal issues, Biden's tax plan would raise $3.35 trillion to $3.67 trillion over a decade if enacted in full starting next year, or 1.3% to 1.4% of gross domestic product.\n\nThe Biden tax plan is highly progressive, increasing taxes for the top 1% of earners by 13% to 18% of after-tax income, while indirectly increasing taxes for most other groups by 0.2% to 0.6%, the committee said, adding, The ultimate fiscal, economic, and distributional impact of President-elect Biden's tax policies will depend on how newly raised revenue is spent or allocated, it added.\n\nMajor proposals by the Biden campaign would raise $1.6 trillion to $1.9 trillion over a decade from corporations, $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from high earners through the income tax, and $800 billion to $1 trillion from Social Security payroll taxes on high-wage earners. Biden also supports a fee on banks, which we believe will raise $100 billion, tax credits for renters and first-time homebuyers that we estimate will cost $300 billion, and an increase of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which we estimate will cost $100 billion.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Biden told ABC News: I will raise taxes for anybody making over $400,000. The very wealthy should pay a fair share. Corporations should pay a fair share. The fact is there are corporations making close to a trillion dollars that pay no tax at all.\n\nHe told the network that his administration would not raise taxes on 90% of the businesses out there are mom and pop businesses that employ less than 50 people. He said the coronavirus pandemic has taken a toll on these businesses. We have to provide them with the ability to reopen. We have to provide more help for them, not less help, he added.\n\nWith that in mind, it's time to consider moves that will lower your 2020 tax bill, and hopefully position you for tax savings in future years too.\n\nFederal tax outlook for 2021-2022\n\nGame the standard deduction\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) almost doubled the standard deduction amounts. For 2020, the basic standard deduction allowances are:\n\n* $12,400 if you are single or use married filing separate status.\n\n* $24,800 if you and your spouse file jointly.\n\n* $18,650 if you are a head of household.\n\n* Slightly higher standard deductions are allowed to those who are 65 or older or blind.\n\nHere's the plan. If your total itemizable deductions for 2020 will be close to your standard deduction amount, consider making enough additional expenditures for itemized deduction items before year-end to exceed the standard deduction. Those prepayments will lower this year's tax bill. Next year, your standard deduction might be a bit bigger thanks to an inflation adjustment, and you can claim it then. Or it could be smaller, if major tax-increase legislation passes, which I think is unlikely.\n\n* The easiest deductible expense to prepay is included in the house payment due on January 1. Accelerating that payment into this year will give you 13 months' worth of itemized home mortgage interest deductions in 2020. Although the TCJA put new limits on these deductions, you're probably unaffected. But ask your tax adviser to be sure.\n\nNext up on the prepayment menu are state and local income and property taxes that are due early next year. Prepaying those bills before year-end can decrease your 2020 federal income tax bill, because your itemized deductions total will be that much higher. However, the TCJA decreased the maximum amount you can deduct for state and local taxes to $10,000 or $5,000 if you use married filing separate status. So, beware of that limitation.\n\nWarning: The state and local tax prepayment drill can be a bad idea if you will owe the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for this year. That's because write-offs for state and local income and property taxes are completely disallowed under the AMT rules. Therefore, prepaying those expenses may do little or no tax-saving good if you will be in the AMT zone. Thankfully, changes included in the TCJA took millions of taxpayers out of AMT danger, but not everybody. Ask your tax adviser if you're in the clear for this year or not.\n\n* Consider making bigger charitable donations this year and smaller donations next year to compensate (more about charitable donations later). That could cause your itemized deductions to exceed your standard deduction this year.\n\n* Finally, consider accelerating elective medical procedures, dental work, and expenditures for vision care. For 2020, you can deduct medical expenses to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), assuming you itemize. Next year, the deduction threshold is scheduled to rise to 10% of AGI, but I doubt Congress will allow that to happen.\n\nSee also: 6 tax moves to consider before the end of the year â€” from Roth IRA conversions to prepaying college tuition\n\nCarefully manage gains and losses in taxable investment accounts\n\nIf you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. The federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels. The add-on 3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT) can also bite at high income levels. So, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised NIIT.\n\nTo the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. In particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the NIIT bites. Ouch.\n\nWhat if you have some loser investments that you would like to unload? Biting the bullet and taking the resulting capital losses this year would shelter capital gains, including high-taxed short-term gains, from other sales this year.\n\nIf selling some losers would cause your 2020 capital losses to exceed your 2020 capital gains, the result would be a net capital loss for the year. No problem. That net capital loss can be used to shelter up to $3,000 of 2020 income from salaries, bonuses, self-employment income, interest income, royalties, and whatever else ($1,500 if you use married filing separate status). Any excess net capital loss is carried forward to next year and beyond.\n\nIn fact, having a capital loss carryover could turn out to be a pretty good deal. The carryover can be used to shelter both short-term gains and long-term gains recognized next year and beyond. This can give you extra investing flexibility in those years, because you won't have to hold appreciated securities for over a year to get a lower tax rate. You'll pay 0% to the extent you can shelter gains with your loss carryover. If there are future tax rate increases (which I think are unlikely through at least 2022), capital loss carryovers into future years could turn out to be really valuable.\n\nPresident-elect Biden's major tax proposals\n\n1. Higher maximum rate\n\nThe pre-election Biden tax plan would raise the top individual federal income rate on ordinary income and net short-term capital gains back to 39.6%, the top rate that was in effect before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) lowered it to 37% for 2018-2025. Biden also said he would generally raise taxes on folks with incomes above $400,000 without supplying specifics.\n\n2. Itemized deductions\n\nBiden has said he would limit the tax benefit of itemized deductions to 28% for upper-income individuals. In other words, each dollar of allowable itemized deductions could not lower your federal income tax bill by more than 28 cents, even if you are in the proposed 39.6% maximum tax bracket.\n\nFor upper-income individuals, Biden would reinstate the pre-TCJA rule that reduces total allowable itemized deductions above the applicable income threshold. Allowable deductions are reduced by 3 cents for every dollar of income above the threshold.\n\nBiden would eliminate the TCJA's $10,000 cap on itemized deductions for state and local taxes.\n\n3. Higher maximum rate on long-term capital gains\n\nUpper-income individuals would face higher capital gains taxes under the Biden plan. Under current law, the maximum effective federal income tax rate on net long-term capital gains and qualified dividends recognized by individual taxpayers is 23.8%, as explained in the main body of this column. Under the Biden plan, net long-term gains (and presumably dividends) collected by those with incomes above $1 million would be taxed at the same 39.6% maximum rate that is proposed for ordinary income and net short-term capital gains. With the 3.8% NIIT add-on, the maximum effective rate on net long-term gains would 43.4% (39.6% plus 3.8%). That would be almost double the current maximum effective rate of only 23.8%.\n\n4. Higher Social Security taxes for upper-income individuals\n\nUnder current law, the 12.4% Social Security tax hits the first $137,700 of 2020 wages or net self-employment income. Employees pay 6.2% via withholding from paychecks, and employers pay the remaining 6.2%. Self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4% out of their own pockets via the self-employment (SE) tax. For 2020, the 12.4% Social Security tax cuts out once 2020 wages or net SE income exceed the $137,700 ceiling. For 2021 and beyond, the Social Security tax ceiling will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. As things currently stand, the 2021 ceiling will rise to $142,800.\n\nThe Biden tax plan would restart the 12.4% Social Security tax on wages and net SE income above $400,000. This is the so-called donut hole approach to increasing the Social Security tax. Over the years, the donut hole would gradually close as the lower edge of the hole is adjusted upward for inflation while the $400,000 upper edge of the hole remains static.\n\n5. Elimination of basis step-up for inherited assets\n\nUnder current law, the federal income tax basis of an inherited capital-gain asset is stepped up fair market value as of the decedent's date of death. So, if heirs sell inherited capital-gain assets, they only owe federal capital gains tax on the post-death appreciation, if any. This provision can be a huge tax-saver for greatly-appreciated inherited assets â€” such as personal residences that were acquired many years ago for next to nothing and are now worth millions. The Biden plan would eliminate this tax-saving provision.\n\n6. Elimination of real-estate tax breaks\n\nThe Biden tax plan would: (1) eliminate the $25,000 exemption from the passive loss rules for rental real estate losses incurred by middle-income individuals, (2) eliminate Section 1031 like-kind exchanges that allow deferral of capital gains taxes on swaps of appreciated real property, (3) eliminate rules that allow faster depreciation write-offs for certain real property, and (4) eliminate qualified business income (QBI) deductions for profitable rental real estate activities.\n\n7. Increased child- and dependent-care credits\n\nUnder current law, parents can collect a credit of up to $2,000 for each under-age-13 qualifying child. This is a refundable credit, which means you don't have to have any federal income tax liability to collect the credit. In other words, the child credit is free money.\n\nUnder current law, another credit of up to $2,100 is allowed to cover expenses to care for a qualifying dependent, including an eligible child, or up to $4,200 for expenses to care for two or more qualifying dependents. In most cases, however, an income limitation reduces the maximum allowable credit to $1,200 or $2,400 for two or more qualifying dependents.\n\nThe Biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. Families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. Apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.\n\nBiden would also establish a new credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers.\n\n8. New credits for homebuyers and renters\n\nThe Biden plan would create a new refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 for eligible first-time homebuyers. The credit could be collected when a home is purchased, rather than later at tax-return filing time. Biden would also establish a new refundable tax credit for low-income renters. The credit would be intended to hold rent and utility payments to 30% of monthly income.\n\n9. 'Green energy' tax changes\n\nBiden would reinstate or expand tax incentives intended to reduce carbon emissions â€” such as deductions for emission-reducing investments in residential and commercial buildings and restored credits for buying electric vehicles produced by manufacturers whose credits have been phased-out under current law. Biden would also eliminate federal income tax deductions for oil and gas drilling costs and depletion.\n\n10. And finallyâ€¦\n\nOne of the biggest changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the installation of a flat 21% corporate federal income tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Before the TCJA, the maximum effective rate for profitable corporations was 35%. The Biden plan would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. This change would raise an estimated $1.1 trillion or so over 10 years.\n\nThe Biden plan would impose a new 15% minimum tax on corporations with at least $100 million in annual income that pay little or no federal income tax under the regular rules. An affected corporation would pay the greater of: (1) the regular federal income tax bill or (2) 15% of reported book net income. This new tax would raise an estimated $160 billion to $320 billion over 10 years.
U.S. stocks opened higher on Wednesday as banking stocks led the Dow Jones Industrial Average closer to the 20,000 milestone. The Dow DJIA, -0.46% gained 25 points, or 0.1%, to 19,906. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% climbed four points, or 0.2%, to 2,262. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% added 13 points, or 0.3%, to 5,447. Morgan Stanley MS, +0.10% , Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.61% saw strong gains, as did Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -3.44% . Investors are awaiting minutes from the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting, at which it decided to raise interest rates for the second time in a decade. Traders will be watching for clues about the central bank's policy outlook.
The Bank of Canada raised interest rates on Wednesday, but not without noting that the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement is a major risk to the economic outlook and briefly sending the Canadian dollar lower.\n\nThe central bank raised its key lending rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, in line with what economists had expected following supportive economic data earlier this month. The Canadian dollar USDCAD, +0.06% fell against its U.S. counterpart immediately following the decision, but subsequently pared its decline. One dollar last bought C$1.2389, down from C$1.2435 late Tuesday.\n\nHere are three important takeaways from the central bank's decision:\n\nNobody knows what a post-Nafta world would look like\n\nWhat effect a termination of Nafta would have on the Canadian economy and the BOC's monetary policy is impossible to predict because it isn't simply a binary event, Bank of Canada Gov. Stephen Poloz said during the news conference following the policy decision on Wednesday.\n\nPoloz and Senior Deputy Gov. Carolyn Wilkins also said that terminating Nafta would likely have a net negative effect for both the U.S. and Canada, but that the effect was very hard to quantify, especially in terms of the long-term effects on corporate investment in Canada. They added that the effects would vary from sector to sector as well.\n\nU.S.-Canadian trade flows equate to 32% of Canadian GDP, said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, so any disruption would be very bad news.\n\nThe Nafta talks in which Canada, Mexico and the U.S. are trying to renegotiate the 24-year old trade pact have contributed to volatility in its members' currencies over the past months, although most of the effect was notable in the Mexican peso USDMXN, -0.02% . The Mexican peso has been hit the hardest time and time again, as an end to the trade deal is expected to hit Mexico most. The next round of talks will take place next week in Montreal.\n\nIt's all about the data\n\nGiven the unknown effect of potential changes or termination of the trade pact, the central bank's governing council will remain cautious and data-driven, said Gov. Poloz. Either raising interest rates too slowly or too quickly could be negative for the Canadian economy, he added.\n\nMost recently, November core consumer price inflation of 1.3% was well below the central bank's 2% inflation target. Consumer prices would likely go up if Nafta was terminated, Poloz said.\n\nFollowing its second 2017 rate hike in September, the bank's continuous reiteration of data-dependency was at times judged as dovish by market participants.\n\nThere may be fewer rate increases than expected in 2018\n\nAhead of Wednesday's meeting, the BOC was expected to raise interest rates three times in 2018, same as the Federal Reserve. But given the uncertainty surrounding the trade negotiations and the BOC statement, which said that its accommodative monetary policy may continue to be warranted to keep the economy and inflation on target, analysts could be adjusting their views downward.\n\nWe're only looking for two hikes this year, said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities, with one being in the books since Wednesday.\n\nING's Knightley, on the other hand, is looking at two additional hikes, making it three in total. Knightley cited the global growth backdrop, as well as rising commodity demand, which could support the natural-resource rich Canadian economy.
WASHINGTON â€” Congress approved a measure Monday to fund the government for about three weeks and halt a three-day shutdown, after Senate Democrats accepted GOP leaders' assurance that they would bring an immigration bill to the floor in the coming weeks.\n\nThe House, as expected, then followed suit and approved the bill, 266-150. President Donald Trump signed the bill Monday night, effectively ending the shutdown.
After months of waiting for the 10-year Treasury yield to break above the 1% level, market participants now say the runoff elections for the U.S> Senate on Tuesday could offer the decisive impetus for a breakthrough.\n\nThe distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and accompanying hopes of a return to economic normality so far have not done much to lift Treasury yields, as bond buying by the Federal Reserve has been more than able to offset any bearish pressure associated with recovering economic growth and rising inflation expectations.\n\nBut analysts say the chance for a more aggressive fiscal policy under a Democratic-controlled Senate, based on the possible outcome of Tuesday's vote, could send long-term bond yields higher.\n\nThat's a growing possibility, with polls showing Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock, in a tight race with their Republican incumbents.\n\nNominal yields on the other hand have flatlined since early December, in a sign that investors believe that the Fed will continue to suppress yields even as inflation expectations normalise, said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research for ING in the Americas. Additional fiscal thrust to the economy could change that dynamic however.\n\nSee: Here's why the Georgia runoff elections for the U.S. Senate could turn into a 'big deal' for markets\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.663% was at 0.94% on Tuesday, a few basis points away from its December high of 0.986%. A push beyond that milestone would set the benchmark note yield on track towards the 1% level that has contained the maturity since March.\n\nEven as yield have remain capped, inflation expectations, as measured by inflation breakeven levels, have steadily climbed, pushing through the key 2% threshold for the first time since November 2018.\n\nAnalysts say the divergence between rising inflation forecasts and the muddled trading in government bonds has been underpinned by the possibility the Fed could still tweak its asset purchases to keep longer-dated rates anchored.\n\nIt's why Ian Lyngen of BMO Capital Markets estimates a Democratic victory over both Senate seats may not do much to benefit the bond bears, only pushing the 10-year yield up by around 10 to 15 basis points.\n\nThat would be enough to push the benchmark rate above 1% but not enough to spark the full-blown bond-market selloff that many feared could occur in 2021.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the broad U.S. economy despite the bearish global stock environment, said Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, on Monday. In a speech in Atlanta, Lockhart said the global selloff in stocks begs the question of whether there are serious imbalances that make the broad economy vulnerable to foreign shocks. I don't see that kind of connection in current circumstances, Lockhart said. The Atlanta Fed president said while fourth-quarter GDP growth could look rather weak and disappointing, he expects moderate growth and labor market improvement this year that will justify more interest-rate increases. Lockhart, who is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee, did not specify his view of the pace of tightening, saying there is no map and no predetermined schedule of increases.
Talk to the entrepreneurs who populate San Francisco, Silicon Valley or New York City's Flatiron District, and you might think you've landed in a foreign country. The startup world is full of jargon that can sound odd â€” if not downright indecipherable â€” to outsiders.
One profession is lagging when it comes to women's pay, but it's not in Silicon Valley or Hollywood.\n\nFemale personal financial advisers make little more than half (56.4%) of men in the same job, compared with 83% overall, according to a 2017 analysis by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization. (Critically, that does not account for women who are missing from senior roles in Silicon Valley and, instead, compares men and women who are in similar jobs.)\n\nEach week, women financial advisers on average make $760 less than their male colleagues, said Ariane Hegewisch, program director for employment and earnings at the institute. It is ironic that an industry focused on helping people achieve financial security has one of the biggest gender wage gaps, she adds. (The National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors, an industry group, did not respond to request for comment.) One explanation: Male clients may prefer male advisers.\n\nDon't miss:What Rosie the Riveter would make today\n\nRebecca Fender, the head of future of finance at CFA Institute, said about 18% of financial advisers are women. We are looking to profile more of the successful women in our industry, she told MarketWatch. It's an important element to attract women into the industry. Visibility is validity. She was surprised, she said, by the size of the gender wage gap for financial advisers and hopes that more firms disclose wage data. We don't think there should be a wage gap for doing similar work.\n\nThere are 4.6 million women who work in occupations with poverty-level wages, nearly three times as many as the 1.5 million men who do, the organization said in a statement on Equal Pay Day, a date to highlight the gender wage gap around the country. In addition, the analysis finds racial disparities compounding gender inequality in the labor market. Black and Hispanic women are more than twice as likely to work in service occupations as white women.\n\nTop Women at Microsoft, JP Morgan Discuss Gender Equality\n\nMothers and women of color face an uphill struggle\n\nNearly three times as many working mothers quit their jobs to care for a family member and a higher percentage turn down promotions, setting them off of the same career acceleration track as their male counterparts, said Jean Martin, talent solutions architect at CEB, a Washington, D.C.-based advisory company. Women who are fast tracked for executive ranks sometimes report back that the demands of traditional executive jobs are enough to drive them out of traditional organizations.\n\nThe gender wage gap for women of color continues to indicate a marked earnings inequality for Hispanic and black women, the Census Bureau previously found. For every dollar earned by a white man, Hispanic women earned 54 cents and black women earned 63 cents in 2015. Black women's earnings increased by 9% to $36,212 a year from $33,225 per year, compared with rises of 4.3% for Asian women, 2.6% for Hispanic women, and 2.8 % for Caucasian women.\n\nMore women are confined to low-wage service work\n\nOf course, in addition to a wage gap within occupations, there is also a wage gap between occupations. Previous Institute for Women's Policy Research analysis has found that more than one in four employed women in the U.S. are concentrated in low-wage service work, such as teaching young children, cleaning, serving, and caring for elders. Workers in these majority-female jobs are also disproportionately women of color, Hegewisch said.\n\nGender pay gap figures don't adjust for job choice and duration, which all influence pay. Women dominate fields like education, which are not typically high-paying. Men dominate fields like IT, math, engineering and sciences, which tend to have higher-paying jobs. But as more women have achieved a college education and entered the workforce over the last half-century, the gender wage gap has improved. In 1960, women were paid around 61 cents on the dollar compared with men.\n\nDon't miss: Half of Americans are desperately living paycheck to paycheck\n\nSo what should companies in 2018 do?\n\nRevisit their pay policies to ensure equitable banding for equal work, CEB's Martin said. They should redesign roles to ensure that there are sufficient roles with the flexibility needed to address family concerns and adopt a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination of all types â€” not just in dollar compensation. but in the distribution of job opportunities, recognition and the way in which teams collaborate and work together.\n\nMeanwhile, the debate over women's lack of representation in high-paying senior roles in Silicon Valley continues. Paul Griffiths, the CEO of MedTouch, a digital content and marketing company focused on the health-care industry, wrote on MarketWatch: The notion that technology must be male-dominated because 'men are better at technology' is antiquated and boring, like any grainy filmstrip from history class about colonizing the moon: quaint, if it weren't so dangerous.\n\nDon't miss: Charlie Rose's sophisticated hunt reveals the often unseen, insidious side of sexual harassment\n\nWomen experience subtle, but damaging, discrimination at work\n\nAround 42% of working women in the U.S. say they have faced discrimination on the job because of their gender, according to a recent report by the Pew Research Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C. And those who have report a broad array of personal experiences that often fall below the radar of human resources. They range from earning less than male counterparts for doing the same job to being passed over for important assignments.\n\nThe survey of nearly 5,000 adults was conducted in the summer before the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations against men in politics, the media and entertainment. Women are twice as likely as men (42% versus 22%) to say they have experienced at least 1 of 8 specific forms of gender discrimination at work; 1 in 4 working women (25%) say they have earned less than a man who was doing the same job; 1 in 20 working men (5%) say they have earned less than a female peer.\n\nThe rate of gender discrimination is consistent across racial and ethnic, generational and partisan lines. But women with more education report experiencing discrimination at significantly higher rates than women with less education. And in some regards, the most highly educated women stand out. Some 57% of women with a postgraduate degree say they've experienced gender discrimination versus 40% with a bachelor's degree and 39% with no college degree.\n\n(This story was updated on April 10, 2018.)
Investors are worried that a global slowdown led by China could begin to sap U.S. growth, but it's Europe that's looking a little sickly at the moment.\n\nExpectations that Germany, Europe's largest economy, could post a second consecutive quarter of falling gross domestic product were on the rise after a dismal reading on November industrial production last week, which showed a 1.9% fall, defying a forecast for a 0.3% rise.\n\nIndustrial production data was a proper disappointment this month. Our German GDP tracker has deteriorated to minus 0.1% [quarter-on-quarter]. This would be the second consecutive [quarter-on-quarter] GDP contraction, meaning Germany could now be in a technical recession, wrote economists Evelyn Herrmann and Gilles Moec at Bank of American Merrill Lynch, in a Monday note (see chart below).\n\nBofA Merrill Lynch\n\nHerrmann and Moec are skeptical the weakness will turn into a full-blown downturn, but others were ringing the alarm bells after the November decline, which was the second consecutive fall and followed data that showed a continued decline in manufacturing orders.\n\nGermany's slowdown is attributable in part to slowing activity in China, the economists said. And concerns about China are certainly on the rise thanks to homegrown headwinds and the continued trade battle with the U.S. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% were feeling modest pressure Monday after a round of weaker-than-expected trade data out of the country.\n\nOn Monday, data showed factory output across the eurozone saw its largest annual decline in six years in November and underscored worries the region's economy isn't bouncing back from a weak third quarter.\n\nThe question is, how bad will it be? wrote Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note. Industrial production is one of our best advance indicators of how GDP will turn out. A drop of industrial production in any quarter signals an 80% chance that GDP declined, based on historical experience, he said, with the plunge in Germany's November industrial production assuring a big contraction for industrial output for the quarter.\n\nHerrmann and Moec argued that half of the November decline in Germany was due to one-time factors, including the aftermath of a sharp drop in car production in the third quarter that appeared to reverberate through the supply chain in the final quarter of 2018. A slowdown in the chemical sector, due in part to cutbacks by BASF SE BAS, -0.83% as a result of low water levels on the Rhine, and a drop in pharmaceutical exports to Ireland after a sharp but difficult to explain run-up from late 2017 through October 2018, were the other factors that may have played a one-time role in the slowdown.\n\nHowever, that still leaves a chunky deterioration in underlying growth momentum, not in Germany, but possibly globally, they said. After stripping out one-time factors, the economists found the slowdown in German output remained slightly below, but within its usual range, around the signal coming from global momentum, which has weakened and suggests growth very close to zero.\n\nThe economists argue that a tight labor market, a slightly looser fiscal stance by Germany's government, a pickup in nominal wage growth and a very tight labor market could ensure that a technical recession doesn't turn into a downturn proper.\n\nThe labor market response in this is key, they said. Domestic demand should strengthen into 2019 driven by fiscal policy, nominal wage growth and inflation. This should keep labor market pressures intact and keep a proper recession at bay, even if corporate sector profitability could be dented.\n\nEconomists define a recession as a significant decline in activity that lasts more than a few months and stretches across the economy, affecting everything from industrial production to employment, wages and wholesale-retail trade.\n\nA full-blown downturn would require additional shocks, Herrmann and Moec wrote. While not part of their base case, the known risks include Brexit, cars, trade wars and China, they said.\n\nWhen it comes to China, a major source of concern over the global growth outlook, data has to stabilize, they warned, noting that their China-based colleagues expect data to turn better in the first half of 2019 as policy stimulus measures kick in. That's a big deal for Germany, they said, estimating that the contribution to German GDP from exports to China moved from minus 30 basis points in mid-2015 to positive 60 basis points in early 2017, before slowing to zero in 2018 â€” a factor that alone explains a large chunk of growth deceleration, they said.
Concern about the burden of government borrowing is largely misplaced, a leading economist argued in a recent closely-watched address.\n\nOlivier Blanchard, the outgoing president of the American Economic Association and the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, used his last speech to try to upset the conventional wisdom that excessive debt was a danger for governments across the world.\n\nWhat do I want you to go away with? Not the notion that debt is good but that debt might not be so bad, Blanchard said.\n\nJason Furman, who was President Obama's chief economist, said Blanchard's comments were groundbreaking.\n\nFiscal austerity was the dominant philosophy across the leading industrial countries in the wake of the financial crisis. Doubts of the policy approach are starting to emerge\n\nAusterity has been the most damaging policy mistake in economics in recent years, said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nIt was like a tragicomedy with governments in Washington, Brussels, and Berlin...getting fiscal policy wrong at great cost to the citizenry, Bernstein said.\n\nIn his speech over the weekend to the AEA's annual conference in Atlanta, Blanchard argued that in the new-low-inflation environment, the real interest rate will remain lower than a countries growth rate. This will allow governments to continue to roll over debt and the debt-to-GDP ratio will shrink over time.\n\nBlanchard did acknowledge it was important that the government spending be well thought out.\n\nThere has to be good reasons to do it, he said. If the spending is well planned, the benefits are likely to exceed the costs.\n\nIn the U.S.. Blanchard's speech may embolden progressive Democrats, who don't want their party to make fiscal austerity a priority.\n\nDon't miss: How the recent tax cuts and budget deal jack up the national debt - in one chart\n\nThe new Democrats are influenced by modern monetary theory, who argue that governments can keep borrowing until there's strong inflationary pressures.
A federal watchdog agency is investigating ways to modernize the process used to determine how much a home is worth.\n\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNMA, -1.05% and Freddie Mac FMCC, -1.08% , issued a request for input on the policies and practices surrounding home appraisals. The regulator is seeking input on a range of proposals, including relaxing key standards that Fannie and Freddie require lenders to abide by for the loans they back.\n\nModernizing the appraisal process has the potential to create a more streamlined and accurate collateral valuation process, FHFA Director Mark Calabria said in announcing the request for information. But if modernization is not properly adopted, it could have negative unintended consequences.\n\nIndeed, while the proposed changes could lead to time- and cost-savings for consumers, experts told MarketWatch that taking the wrong steps could disadvantage consumers, particularly people of color.\n\nModernizing the appraisal process could have unintended consequences\n\nCritics of proposals to overhaul the appraisal process point to a number of ways in which the changes the FHFA is considering could negatively impact households across the country.\n\nIn particular, experts pointed out a number of concerns tied to appraisal waivers, one of the proposals the FHFA is exploring. The problem with a waiver is you don't know what you don't know, said Joan Trice, CEO of the Collateral Risk Network, an organizer of appraisers and risk managers. You didn't send an appraiser into that house. How do you know they didn't gut it and run out of money? You have no idea.\n\nIn this way, appraisers act as a line of defense for home buyers and owners, preventing them from assuming more debt than their home is worth.\n\nAnd there are more ways in which waiving appraisals can cause issues for the housing market. Once an appraisal is completed, the data collected on that property is then fed into computer models that provide the comp values appraisers compare to produce their next appraisal. Should the number of waivers granted continue to increase, that could cause problems down the road.\n\nIf those appraisals are replaced with waivers it would be logical to assume there will be less data to drive the models in the future, said Tom O'Grady, CEO of Pro Teck Valuation Intelligence, a property data and valuation firm. And if a property goes uninspected, then changes to the state of the property could go unnoticed, that could have a dramatic effect on the overall market value of the home, O'Grady added.\n\nIn some cases, the negative consequences of the proposed changes could depend on how they are enacted. With waivers, Trice expressed concerns that more privileged homeowners could have easier access. It's mostly white, wealthy people who get a waiver, and minority and the affordable housing sector don't get waivers, she said. This could lead to disparate impact, she argued, and could drive costs higher for the latter group if appraisers need to make up for lost business.\n\nSimilarly, Trice cautioned that regulators would need to establish clear guidelines for people doing on-the-ground work as part of hybrid appraisals, another process regulators are investigating.\n\nNow Fannie and Freddie have decided that they don't care if Uber drivers are entering your home and inspecting it, Trice cautioned. How do they know that person is not a convicted felon if there's absolutely no due diligence on this group?\n\nInstead, Trice suggested limiting who could participate in a hybrid appraisal. In particular, she sees this as a strong opportunity for appraiser trainees. Here's a great opportunity for training to cut their teeth, she said.\n\nAppraisals can be a road bump in the home-buying process\n\nAppraisals have major stakes for home buyers and sellers alike. During a traditional appraisal, a licensed or certified appraiser visits a property that will be backed by a mortgage, collects data on the state of the home and then compares that data to other nearby properties. Lenders then use the appraised value to determine how much to lend to the prospective borrower.\n\nIf appraisals come in lower than expected, it can jeopardize a sale if the buyer in question cannot make up the difference between the mortgage offered and the proposed sale price. But too high of an appraisal represents a risk, too: If home prices fall, it creates an even larger burden for the homeowner and mortgage lender alike, especially if the homeowner falls behind on their payments.\n\nWhile appraisals are critical to the lending process, they can also slow things down. Some argue that the nation has a shortage of qualified appraisers. Between 2014 and 2018, the number of appraisers nationwide dropped by more than 10%, according to data from the Appraisal Institute, an international trade group for property appraisers.\n\nWhen mortgage demand increases â€” as it did this past year â€” that can cause serious capacity constraints, with appraisals slowing down the process to close a loan. Finding an appraiser can also be more challenging depending on where someone lives.\n\n Between 2014 and 2018, the number of appraisers nationwide dropped by more than 10%. \n\nIt's a question of supply and demand. Turn times go up and down with the number of refinances and purchase mortgages taking place at any given time, O'Grady said.\n\nThe 'shortage' appears to be seasonal, with more than enough appraisers to service the communities during other time periods, O'Grady added. Rural properties have always been a challenge due to the nature of the location, as well as possible complexity of the appraisal assignment.\n\nSome argue that improper appraisals contribute to the racial wealth gap\n\nAnother criticism that has been levied against traditional appraisal practices is that homes owned by people of color often receive lower appraisals than homes owned by their white neighbors, even when factors such as property size and location are similar.\n\nLast year, President-elect Joe Biden proposed creating more stringent standards for housing appraisals to ensure that professionals in the field do not hold implicit bias that influence their work. At the time, the appraisal industry argued these standards were already in place. National appraisal standards and ethics requirements already require appraisers to perform their work with impartiality, objectivity and independence, without bias, said Jefferson Sherman, president of the Appraisal Institute.\n\nHowever, a report from researchers at the left-leaning Brookings Institution found that homes in similar neighborhoods with similar amenities were assessed as being worth 23% less in majority-Black neighborhoods, compared to areas with few Black residents. Altogether, this amounts to over $156 billion in losses for black homeowners, researchers found.\n\nHow to overhaul the appraisal process\n\nThe FHFA has suggested it is exploring a number of fixes, including ones proposed by Fannie and Freddie themselves. These include embracing automation technology that can produce faster appraisals using existing data and allowing so-called hybrid appraisals.\n\nAlso known as bifurcated appraisal, a hybrid appraisal is one in which a trained individual conducts the home visit and gathers the necessary data. That information is then relayed to an appraiser working from an office, who does the computations needed to ascertain the property's value. Many lenders already accept hybrid appraisals for some loans, and Fannie and Freddie have been exploring the process since 2018.\n\n Homes in Black neighborhoods were valued at 23% less than homes in white neighborhoods, one study found. \n\nBeyond the attempts to modernize, the FHFA has also said it wants input on how much the appraisal contributes to racial discrepancies in home values.\n\nThe FHFA is also exploring the value of appraisal waivers. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, federal regulators and housing authorities, along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have relaxed requirements for appraisals on certain loans. While most new loans backed by Fannie and Freddie during the COVID emergency featured traditional appraisals these flexibilities provide a way to protect the health and safety of industry participants, comply with local restrictions throughout the country, and continue to provide liquidity and stability to the market. One of the considerations the FHFA is exploring is whether to allow more permanent waivers for appraisals.\n\nChanges to the appraisal process could save Americans time and money\n\nMany of the changes the FHFA is considering are already in practice â€” though it has yet to gain the official stamp of approval beyond a pilot program for loans backed by Fannie and Freddie, which currently represent over half the mortgage market.\n\nFor instance, Clear Capital, a California-based appraisal company, has completed more than 120,000 hybrid or modern appraisals over the past couple years, Kenon Chen, the company's executive vice president of corporate strategy, said.\n\nThe company has trained more than 700 people around the country on how to do the on-the-ground aspects of the appraisal process, such as measuring for square footage and sketching a home's layout, and then transmit that information to an office-based appraiser who does the necessary computations to come up with a report. Many of the people doing the in-person work for Clear Capital are real-estate agents and brokers, Chen said.\n\nAs the technology gets better we think that it would be easier to pull in other potential workforces as well, Chen said. COVID has given us the opportunity to see what it would like to even gather data from homeowners.\n\nBecause of the time the hybrid process saves, Chen said that the hybrid approach has resulted in a 26% savings on average for mortgage borrowers. Appraisals can cost anywhere from $315 to more than $1,000 depending on the complexity of the project, according to HomeAdvisor.\n\nSimplifying and speeding up the appraisal process can have other savings-related benefits for consumers. During the pandemic, appraisals were waived for refinance loans, in particular. Research has indicated that by waiving the requirement for appraisals, this allowed more refinances to be processed in 2020 by lenders.\n\n For many homeowners, the increased use of appraisal waivers has provided a tangible financial benefit and helped them weather the economic stress of the COVID-19 pandemic.  â€” Urban Institute vice president of housing finance policy Laurie Goodman and senior research associate Michael Neal\n\nResearchers at the Urban Institute looked at how often mortgage loans were prepaid in 2020 and compared it to past years â€” prepayments are a proxy for refinance activity. Their research found that falling interest rates alone didn't explain the surge in refinance activity, suggesting that appraisal waivers played a role.\n\nFor many homeowners, the increased use of appraisal waivers has provided a tangible financial benefit and helped them weather the economic stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers wrote.
With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris set to depart her U.S. Senate seat this month, a new analysis sheds light on record gains for Black women's representation in Congress â€” and the work left to be done.\n\nBlack women remain underrepresented despite the record-breaking number who will serve in the 117th Congress, according to an analysis published Sunday by the nonprofit Higher Heights Leadership Fund and Rutgers University's Center for American Women in Politics (CAWP).\n\nTwenty-six Black women will serve as voting members at the beginning of the new Congress, the analysis said, outstripping the previous record of 23. They include Rep. Cori Bush, the first Black woman to represent Missouri in Congress, and Rep. Marilyn Strickland, the first Black woman to represent Washington state as well as one of the first Korean-American congresswomen. Two Black women will also serve as non-voting House delegates representing Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands. All are Democrats.\n\nBut with Harris heading to the White House later this month, the number of Black women in Congress drops to 25 and the number of Black female U.S. senators falls to zero. (Despite pressure to replace Harris with another woman of color, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said last month that the state's secretary of state, Alex Padilla, would finish out the remainder of her Senate term.)\n\nThe remaining 25 Black female House members are poised to see their numbers further reduced this year, as President-elect Joe Biden has selected Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge as the second Black woman to lead the Housing and Urban Development Department.\n\n 'Despite an increase in Republican Black women candidates and nominees, Black women's congressional representation remains entirely Democratic.'  â€” analysis by Higher Heights Leadership Fund and Center for American Women in Politics\n\nAll Black women currently serving in Congress are Democrats, the analysis also pointed out. Former Rep. Mia Love of Utah, the first and only Black Republican woman to serve in Congress, lost her reelection bid in 2018.\n\nDespite an increase in Republican Black women candidates and nominees, Black women's congressional representation remains entirely Democratic, the report said. More specifically, in a year where Republican women made up the majority of women newcomers to Congress, no Republican women winners were Black.\n\nAll told, the 26 Black women serving in Congress as of Monday made up just about 4.9% of the 535 voting seats while accounting for 7.6% of the country's population, according to the report. Only 47 Black women have ever served in Congress since seven-term New York Rep. Shirley Chisholm made history in 1968 as the first Black congresswoman.\n\nWith no Black women serving in the Senate after Jan. 20, we must work hard to ensure that we will never again have Black women without representation in the highest offices of our country and we invest in a strategy to elect Black women in the Senate, said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights, which works to expand Black women's elected representation.\n\nWomen's success in the 2018 midterms did not fully upend the entrenched institutional norms and structures that have placed them at an electoral disadvantage, according to a 2019 CAWP report.

An earlier version of this story gave incorrect historic data for the Hang Seng Index.\n\nHong Kong's stock benchmark declined on Monday and broke a 14-day winning streak, falling alongside Chinese equities after some downbeat domestic data.\n\nOther Asian stock markets logged gains in Monday's session, after all three major U.S. stock indexes closed at record highs on Friday on the hope that increases in earnings will justify high valuations. U.S. markets are closed Monday for a holiday.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, -1.55% ended down 0.2%, after climbing around 1% earlier in the session.\n\nThe turnaround came amid steep losses in mainland Chinese equities. The Shenzhen Composite 399106, -1.65% ended down 1.8% and the startup-heavy ChiNext skidded 3% after Friday data showed a big end-of-year deceleration in loan growth, and China's broadest measure of money-supply posted another record-low increase.\n\nThe data signaled that Beijing's push to deleverage the country's economy will likely drive up borrowing costs and hurt economic growth, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -1.45% , which has risen a record 11-straight days, fell 0.5% on Monday, although gains in financial stocks tempered losses.\n\nAmong movers in Hong Kong and China, Tencent Holdings Ltd. 700, -1.95% fell 2%, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 1.5% that came the Chinese internet heavyweight said it had reached a deal to make French videogame maker Ubisoft's UBI, -0.22% Ketchapp mobile games available on WeChat.\n\nIn Japan, a climb in the financial sector helped the Nikkei 225 index NIK, -1.17% rise 0.3%, even as the yen USDJPY, -0.01% hit a four-month high against the dollar, even after even after Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda failed to offer anything new for market participants looking for signs of monetary tightening. The greenback bought Â¥110.58 compared with Â¥111.04 late Friday in New York.\n\nIn Taiwan, the stock benchmark XX:Y9999 rose 0.7% to notch another 28-year closing high. In New Zealand stocks again underperformed. As has been the case in recent sessions, early gains evaporated around midday and the NZX 50 NZ50GR, +0.15% ended at session lows, down 0.4%. Milk exporters were a noted laggard.
Gold futures held onto their gains in electronic trading late Wednesday after settling at a more than three-week high. Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's December meeting revealed that officials from the central bank saw the possibility that they might have to raise interest rates faster than the gradual pace that they have stressed for some time. Higher interest rates can be a negative for gold, which tends to benefit from looser monetary policy, but the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.41% extended its decline after the minutes, offering dollar-denominated gold some support. February gold gcg7 was at $1,165.90 an ounce in electronic trading. It had settled at $1,165.30 an ounce, up $3.30, or 0.3%, for the session.
Shares of Peloton Interactive Inc. undefined took a hit in afternoon trading Thursday, after word got out of a note from Chief Executive John Foley that he recently learned about a fatal accident involving a child and the at-home fitness company's Tread+ product. The stock slumped 3.8% in afternoon trading; the stock was down about 2.0% just before the news. While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved, Foley said. To prevent further accidents, he said to keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times, and to remove the safety key and store it out of children's reach after finishing a workout. Peloton's stock has tumbled 31.6% year to date, while the S&P 500 undefined has gained 5.2%.
European markets dropped on Monday, tracking losses for global equities as weak Chinese data triggered global economic concerns\n\nDrug and bank names also contributed to the weakness, while in the U.K., investors had one more worry â€” a parliamentary vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's contentious Brexit withdrawal agreement Tuesday.\n\nAll major European indexes struggled on Monday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.88% losing 0.9% to 346.20, after finishing up 1.7% for the week on Friday.\n\nItaly's FTSE MIB I945, +0.50% index was the biggest regional loser on Monday, dropping 1% to 19,092.30. France's CAC 40 PX1, +0.32% dropped 0.7% to 4,749.16, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 UKX, +0.80% fell 0.8% to 6,861.70 and Germany's DAX 30 DAX, +0.66% lost 0.6% to 10,826.20.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.03% traded remained mostly unchanged from $1.1469 late in New York on Friday.\n\nThe British pound was bouncing around on Monday, with a crucial vote on May's Brexit deal just a day away. The pound GBPUSD, -0.06% was trading at $1.2849 from $1.2830 late Friday in New York.\n\nWhat is driving the markets?\n\nWeaker-than-expected Chinese trade data hit investor appetite for perceived riskier assets, such as stocks, and sparked fresh worries over a global economic slowdown. Some luxury goods companies, many of which get a chunk of their business from China, took a hit, with Christian Dior SE CDI, +1.39% down over 2%.\n\nIn the U.K., markets are expected to remain on edge ahead of Tuesday's vote over a deal for Britain to leave the European Union. May's plan is expected to be rejected by lawmakers, leaving the current Conservative government to likely face a vote of no confidence from the opposition Labour Party, whose own Brexit policy is equally divided.\n\nWhat stocks are active?\n\nPandora A/S PNDORA, +3.63% shares plunged more than 6%, after Morgan Stanley cut its price target for the Danish jewelry company, and it expects upcoming earnings to disappoint and management to announce a restructuring.\n\nAmong the heavyweights, pharmaceutical group Novartis AG NOVN, +1.44% NVS, +0.84% fell 1.3% and banking group HSBC Holdings PLC HSBC, -0.64% HSBA, -0.28% fell over 1%.\n\nBritain's Burberry PLC BRBY, -0.99% bucked a weaker trend for luxury-goods groups, gaining 1% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch reportedly raised its stock recommendation to neutral from underperform.
Bitcoin prices settled slightly higher on Tuesday, regaining a foothold above $11,000, but remained mostly under pressure as officials in South Korea announced new measures to regulate trading in cryptocurrencies.\n\nA single bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.68% was up 3.5% late Tuesday to fetch about $11,140, recovering some of its decline of the session but still half its peak of nearly 20,000 put in last month, according to research and data site CoinDesk.com.\n\nIn the futures market, the February contract US:XBTG8 on Cboe Global Markets Inc. CBOE, -1.34% settled up 7.4% to close at $10,975, while January futures US:BTCF8 on the CME Group Inc. CME, -0.39% ended up 7.1% at $11,095. That contract expires on Friday.\n\nThe cryptocurrency remains unable to break through $12,000. That level has been tested on Thursday, Friday and Monday and rejected and now bitcoin seems to be unable to break out past $11,000 and was last trading at $10,500, noted Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, in a note to clients.\n\nWilson said if bitcoin breaks below $10,000, then it could retest the January 17 low of $9,200, and from there, $8,000 would be the next level that could be taken out. Going the other way, he said if it can move above $12,000, then the next level of resistance is $13,200.\n\nSouth Korea cracks down\n\nBitcoin sagged as South Korean officials, who have been exploring tighter bans on trading, announced new measures. The Financial Services Commission (FSC), the nation's finance watchdog, on Tuesday laid out its strategy to curb speculation in cryptocurrency trading. As part of that, it will ban anonymous accounts linked to digital currencies.\n\nWith the real name policy coming into effect at the end of this month, the existing 'virtual accounts,' anonymous accounts that have been widely used to trade cryptocurrencies, will no longer be in use, the FSC said.\n\nThe body said it also approved guidelines from the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) and the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) for banks to prevent cryptocurrency money-laundering. High-level due diligence by financial institutions in any transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges are just one of the guidelines.\n\nOn Monday, Yonhap News Agency reported that the government plans to collect 24.2% of taxes from the country's cryptocurrency exchanges this year. Wall Street Journal reported that cryptocurrency platform OKCoin will open in South Korea as early as next month.\n\nSwiss-based commodities fund Tiberius on Monday announced plans to launch the first digital coinâ€”tcoinâ€”pinned to industrial metals, such as copper and aluminum, Reuters reported. There are currently other digital coins backed by precious metals.\n\nStripe stops accepting bitcoin payment\n\nPayment processor Stripe said it would stop processing bitcoin as a payment on its platform, starting April 23, 2018. Tom Karlo, a product manager with Stripe, in a blog post wrote that over the past year or two, as block size limits have been reached, Bitcoin has evolved to become better-suited to being an asset than being a means of exchange.\n\nâ€”Mark DeCambre contributed to this article
Antoinette Kunda wasn't always rushing to make deliveries for strangers and pick up riders. Prior to the Great Recession, she worked as an executive administrative assistant at American Express AXP, -2.51% , where she earned $80,000 a year, or approximately $6,667 a month.\n\nToday, she works in the gig economy. I do not consider myself having a primary job, Kunda said. She works for Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Instacart, DoorDash, Grubhub and various other on-demand delivery and rideshare apps. My primary job is putting a roof over my head, she said.\n\n The government reported a sharp rise in wages in August, but Antoinette Kunda's income is notoriously unpredictable. \n\nAlso see: U.S. adds 201,000 jobs as worker wages accelerate to nine-year high\n\nHer current goal is to make $5,000 a month but, in reality, she said she is lucky if she can pocket $100 a day or $2,800 a month. Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a sharp rise in wages in December reaching a post-recession high of 3.9%, but Kunda's income is notoriously unpredictable, which means she often has to work longer hours than when she had her 9 to 5 office job.\n\nYet, all of her work and the work of other so-called side hustlers or gig workers who typically take on multiple jobs, is essentially invisible in the eyes of the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. Though the agency is a key source of information about the labor market, it doesn't keep tabs on how much people make in what the government calls non-primary work.\n\nAntoinette Kunda, who works multiple gig jobs. Antoinette Kunda\n\nOn Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported on a new study, citing gig-economy experts who say economists have overestimated its impact on the U.S. economy. Alan Krueger of Princeton University and Lawrence Katz of Harvard sifted through new evidence to explain how, in a 2015 survey, they overestimated how people cobbling together a living from odd jobs, especially via apps like Uber, would upend traditional work arrangements, the paper said.\n\nThat's a problem because the gig economy matters. All that missing data could help economists understand the state of our economy and the changing nature of the workforce, and â€” in a climate of stagnant wage growth â€” shed more light on how much money people earn. It's also crucial for policy makers who may seek to enact minimum wage and overtime pay laws for workers.\n\nThese laws could help drivers who are struggling to make ends meet, said Harry Campbell, who runs a blog advising drivers called the Rideshare Guy and currently drives for Uber and Lyft. A lot of drivers are living paycheck to paycheck and they know they need to make $100 each day, he said.\n\nHaving reliable wage data helps lawmakers, companies and workers make plans. It tells us how the economy is doing and how much money people are going to be spending, said Aparna Mathur, a resident scholar in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington D.C. Tracking the labor market is key to everything else in the economy because it informs investment decisions, she said.\n\nHarry Campell, founder of the 'Rideshare Guy' blog. Harry Campbell\n\nThere is no agreed upon definition of the gig economy\n\nIt's tough to measure something when no one can agree on what's being measured.\n\nThe BLS does not have an explicit definition for a gig worker, or a formal way of tracking them. It comes closest in a survey called the Contingent Worker Supplement, which studies contingent workers in temporary working arrangements that they don't expect to last more than a year.\n\nBut prior to last month, the BLS had not released the Contingent Worker Supplement since 2005 due in large part to a lack of funding. The most recent report found that 5.9 million people or 3.8% of all workers are contingent workers.\n\nSee also:If the economy is so great, why are 78 million hustling for dimes?\n\nIt's not that the BLS doesn't care about secondary work, they do, said Demetra Nightingale, an economist at the Urban Institute, a think tank based in Washington D.C. But without adequate funding it is difficult for the BLS to study those workers, she said.\n\nThese workers come in many forms. They include side hustlers with regular jobs and freelancers who take on extra clients on their off-hours, according to Freelancing in America, a 2017 survey conducted in part by Freelancers Union. That survey estimated that 57.3 million Americans are freelancing, or 36% of the workforce, but those freelancing could be choppy and not well paid.\n\nAmerica's Changing Workforce: Independent and Gig Workers\n\nOther estimates say the gig economy is even larger than that. The Federal Reserve has a very broad definition of people working in the gig economy. The Fed says gig workers could be anyone from a babysitter to an Uber driver. According to that definition, there are as many as 75 million gig workers.\n\nLawrence Mishel, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute and former president of the left-leaning- pro-labor think tank, said it's important to avoid using broad definitions of gig workers that risk overstating the number of gig workers and their ability to impact the economy.\n\nMany reporters wrongfully equate gig work with the work of independent contractors, he said. Then some people, including the Federal Reserve, refer to gig work as informal work which is anything you do to make a buck.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics is trying to get better estimates\n\nAnother reason for the lack of certainty with the government estimates: There are big gaps in the Contingent Worker Supplement. The survey only asks questions about an individual's main job, whether it's full-time or part-time, and gathers no information about wages and hours worked for non-primary work.\n\nThe fundamental basic question we ask in the CWS is did you do any work for profit, said Karen Kosanovich, an economist at the BLS. If you did any work last week then you have a job.\n\nTo better gauge the extent of the gig economy the BLS included four new questions in the May 2017 Contingent Worker Supplement, which is currently being evaluated and will be released in September 2018. That's in addition to the 240 questions on previous versions of the CWS.\n\nThe amount of questions respondents answer varies significantly depending upon the individual's current working circumstances. On average, the BLS estimates that it takes respondents nine minutes to complete the questionnaire.\n\nThe four new questions are:\n\nDid you earn income through a short in-person task using a website or app last week?\n\nWas that for your main job, your second job, or other additional work for pay?\n\nDid you perform any work for pay through companies that maintain lists that are accessed through an app or a website?\n\nWas that work for your main job, second job or additional work for pay?\n\nNone of the questions ask respondents the number of hours they work or the wages they earn in completing these types of jobs. (If this was their main job, the wage data would appear in the Current Population Survey, which is used to determine the monthly unemployment and wage rate.)\n\nAnd if it is not their main job? The sample size would be too small, said Julie Hatch Maxfield, assistant commissioner from the Office of Current Employment Analysis at the BLS. She said people who take on gig work are typically supplementing their income from their primary job.\n\nAs a result, the BLS cannot say for certain how many Uber drivers exist in the U.S. The BLS is missing a lot of these workers who don't think of themselves as having a primary job, Mathur said. And that's why people are telling them to ask more specific questions to understand what is considered non-traditional work.\n\nMeanwhile, Antoinette Kunda feels like all her hard work goes largely unrecorded by economists. The government doesn't have a freaking clue about the work that I do, she said.\n\n(This story was updated on Jan. 7, 2019.)

Sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes the bear eats you.\n\nPass the A-1 bear sauce! This time we eat the bear.\n\nBuy low, sell high is always good advice, and we have sold high on our advice of going 100% to cash stands strong. The mechanical technical recommendations continue to sour quickly as momentum remains frustratingly unsustainable; our advice (remember we have over nine years of following this strategy and can recognize when it makes recommendations that are at that point in the cycle unlikely to be wise advice) is still to hold 100% in cash.\n\nI stick with my firmest advice: While Obama is president, cash is king.\n\nThis past week, our momentum-based portfolio holdings in large-cap indices, technology and insurance have taken it on the chin. We knew that already; it has been weeks since equity markets have been able to provide sustainable positive momentum.\n\nThink about it. What is a security worth to you? How about the net present value of a stream of a total of total return to you (dividends plus interest adjusted for principal gains and losses) discounted at a riskless rate of return (usually the interest rate on a new 10-year U.S. Treasury note)?\n\nAll of the factors of that equation carry strong negative risk:\n\nInterest rates are near all-time lows and are expected to rise\n\nThe risks to investors in even U.S. Treasury bonds are rising (and lenders are right to demand higher interest rates)\n\nThe Fed's range of policy choices is narrowing as we artificially try to manage the economy\n\nThe stock market is at or near all-time highs (never a positive sign)\n\nPrincipal risks on even riskless US Treasury bonds in the secondary resale market are rising as interest rates rise\n\nWhat's next? Now that you have sold high, where and when will you buy low?\n\nLike last year when major stock indices fell, this year it may be that you will stay in cash all year barely making a tiny positive return going forward. The best advice is to watch the smart money (those investors who are the first to identify undervalued sectors).\n\nAt this point, it is wise to remember the lessons of the 2008 market correction:\n\nThe only thing that goes up in falling markets is correlation (when stock and bond markets decline everything declines in value especially riskless investments) The Smart Money on Wall Street, and even Main Street, invests in only one type of investment: what they feel are undervalued securities. Today there are well over 1000 different sector funds and ETFs available. Sector funds (in which we recommend you invest) allow you to scan the horizon for rallying sectors. When the Smart Money investors identify an undervalued sector, their investment money start to invest in that sector, they will drive up the price of that sector; the more narrow the sector the more profound the market rise. A diversified portfolio of five or more sector funds allows diversification, liquidity and profit potential for investors. If you have gone to cash before the correction, you will have more money to invest in the recovering markets and you can afford to diversify among a number of sector funds increases the odds of finding a few sectors that generate significant capital gains. Given the longer-term momentum of well-undervalued securities in a down market, you have greater odds of earning tax-preferred long-term capital gains as we did with most of our largest portfolio allocations in 2013 and 2014. Lower long-term capital-gains profits reduce total return-oriented risk. Remember you only have to hold on for a year to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment.\n\nBanner years ahead?\n\nTherefore, 2016 or 2017 will be years with the high-probability positive potential to earn tax-preferred long-term capital gains treatment on recovering sector funds bought at bargain prices and kept in a diversified managed-risk portfolio.\n\nProactive Fund Investor is dedicated to earning high-probability, lower-risk, higher-total-return profits in liquid diversified portfolios. For those of you in retirement or closing in on retirement, any of these benefits will increase your odds of retiring in dignity.\n\nOnce again, you should seriously consider that you should follow our strategies for all of your portfolios including both taxable and tax-deferred accounts.\n\nGet your retirement accounts in order now\n\nOnce again, if you are serious about retirement with dignity, and serious about making the most of your savings, as we have said before, you have two financial strategies that you should consider immediately:\n\nMove to a state income tax-free state Get all of your tax-deferred retirement savings transferred into Roth IRA accounts\n\nIf you lived in California you are paying as much as 13% state income taxes; I was and a few years back I moved to first Texas and then Washington State and saved one-third of my income tax bill. You should do the same. All it takes to be a resident of an income-tax-fee state is to visit the state looking for a future home (your hotel bill is your proof). You owe it to yourself, your spouse and your family to at least consider the move.\n\nTo switch from a tax-deferred retirement savings accounts to a potentially tax-free Roth IRA savings account. Waiting to do so will only require that you pay higher income taxes in the future on hopefully additional savings (you can't believe federal income tax rates will fall); they will most likely rise, and you can manage the state income tax bill on your tax-deferred savings by relocating, if appropriate, as soon as possible, then converting. If that involves a change of employer, you have an ideal opportunity to convert all of your 401(k) and/or 403b balances to Roth accounts at the time.\n\nSo make your checklist now, and go forward confidently.

WASHINGTON (Project Syndicate) â€” The recent decline in China's currency, the renminbi or yuan, which has fueled turmoil in Chinese stock markets and drove the government to suspend trading twice last week, highlights a major challenge facing the country: how to balance its domestic and international economic obligations.\n\nThe approach the authorities take will have a major impact on the well-being of the global economy.\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis, coupled with the disappointing recovery in the advanced economies that followed, injected a new urgency into China's efforts to shift its growth model from one based on investment and external demand to one underpinned by domestic consumption. Navigating such a structural transition without causing a sharp decline in economic growth would be difficult for any country. The challenge is even greater for a country as large and complex as China, especially given today's environment of sluggish global growth.\n\nAlso read David Marsh:China's worst-kept secret: Yuan is unpegged from dollar\n\nFor years, China's government sought to broaden equity ownership, thereby providing more Chinese citizens with a stake in a successful transition to a market economy. But, like the United States' effort to expand home ownership in the years preceding the 2008 crisis, Chinese policies went too far, creating a financially unsustainable situation that implied the possibility of major price declines and dislocations.\n\nAs a result, the adjustment challenge has grown dramatically. With Chinese companies no longer able to sell a rapidly increasing volume of products abroad and support further expansion of productive capacity, the economy has lost some important growth, employment and wage engines. The resulting economic slowdown has undermined the government's capacity to maintain inflated asset prices and avoid pockets of credit distress.\n\nIn an effort to limit the detrimental impact of all this on citizens' well-being, Chinese officials have been guiding the currency lower USDCNY, +0.07% . A surprise devaluation last August has been followed by a number of lower daily fixes in the onshore exchange rate, all intended to make Chinese goods more attractive abroad, while accelerating import substitution at home. The renminbi has depreciated even more in the offshore market USDCNH, +0.31% .\n\nChina's currency devaluations are consistent with a broader trend among both emerging and advanced economies in recent years. Soon after the global financial crisis, the U.S. relied heavily on expansionary monetary policy, characterized by near-zero interest rates and large-scale asset purchases, which weakened the dollar BUXX, +0.34% , thereby boosting exports. More recently, the European Central Bank has adopted a similar approach, guiding the euro USDEUR, +0.54% downward in an effort to boost domestic activity.\n\nBut in pursuing its domestic objectives, China risks inadvertently amplifying global financial instability. Specifically, investors worry that renminbi devaluation could steal growth from other countries, including those that have far more foreign debt and far less robust financial cushions than China, which maintains ample international reserves.\n\nThis concern speaks to the even more challenging balancing act that China must perform as it seeks to play the role in global economic governance that its economic weight warrants. After all, China is now the world's second-largest economy (and, by some non-market measures, the largest).\n\nAnd, indeed, China has lately been showing greater interest in gradually internationalizing its financial system. Notably, it recently succeeded in persuading the International Monetary Fund to add the renminbi to the basket of currencies that determines the value of the special drawing right, the unit the IMF uses in dealing with its 188 member countries.\n\nThat step â€” which places the renminbi on par with the major global currencies (the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen) â€” will enhance public- and private-sector acceptance of China's currency in the international monetary system. At the same time, it created the expectation â€” though not the obligation â€” that China will refrain from aggravating global financial instability.\n\nThere will come a time when China's domestic and international responsibilities will again be relatively well-aligned. But that time is not now; and, given the country's tricky ongoing structural transition, it probably will not come anytime soon.\n\nIn the meantime, it seems likely that China will continue to feel compelled to place its domestic obligations first, but in a nuanced way aimed at avoiding large disruptive tipping points for the global economy. Whether that will be enough to avoid disorderly outcomes, however, is not totally assured.\n\nThis article has been published with the permission of Project Syndicate â€” The Chinese Economy's Great Wall.
U.S. stocks closed down Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 600 points as Apple Inc. posted its biggest percentage drop since 2013 while investors reacted badly to a weaker-than-expected reading on manufacturing activity.\n\nThursday's swoon translated to the worst start to a year for both the S&P 500 and the Dow since 2000, while for Nasdaq it was the weakest start since 2005.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% slumped 660.02 points, or 2.8%, to 22,686.22. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% shed 62.14 points, or 2.5%, to 2,447.89, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% tumbled 202.43 points, or 3%, to 6,463.50.\n\nRead: Citi's Levkovich cuts S&P 500 target as sentiment enters panic mode\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nApple AAPL, +1.27% slashed its quarterly revenue forecast for the first time in more than 15 years Wednesday evening, in a move that the iPhone maker's chief executive, Tim Cook, said was prompted by signs of weakness in the world's second-largest economy â€” China.\n\nFirst Take:Apple lives up to Wall Street's fears with massive revenue shortfall\n\nThe announcement by Apple comes as investors are wrestling with worries that a protracted tariff dispute between Washington and Beijing is starting to hurt some of the biggest and most influential U.S. companies, threatening the growth outlook and a longstanding bull market that already appears in tatters.\n\nFragile sentiment was further battered after a survey from the Institute for Supply Management showed U.S. manufacturing growing at the slowest pace in two years, intensifying concerns among investors that the U.S. economy is running out of steam along with other large economies in Asia and Europe.\n\nApple's announcement and the ISM report follow fresh signs of Chinese economic weakness after Beijing's official manufacturing reading for December showed a more severe drop than one issued earlier, reflecting a fall to the weakest level since February 2016.\n\nInvestors also remain focused on the Federal Reserve and its interest-rate policy in 2019, ahead of Friday morning's employment situation report. The jobs numbers will be a key data point for Fed officials, as they try to determine whether the economy is healthy enough for further rate increases this year, after raising rates four times in 2018.\n\nAt its most recent meeting in December, the median forecast by members of the central bank's interest-rate-setting committee predicted two more rate increases in 2019, but investors are predicting a more than 71.6% probability that the central bank stays pat this year, according to CME Group data, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan advocated for a pause in interest-rate increases during a Thursday-morning interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\nWhat data were in focus?\n\nThe private sector added 217,000 new jobs in December, according to an estimate by payroll firm ADP, above consensus estimates of 180,000 new jobs, according to FactSet.\n\nThe Labor Department estimated that 231,000 Americans applied for unemployment benefits in the final week of 2018, surpassing the 218,000 reading expected by a MarketWatch poll of economists.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index fell to 54.1% in December, down from 59.3% the month before and well below economists' expectations of 57.0, per a MarketWatch poll.\n\nWhat were analysts saying?\n\nThe ISM Manufacturing survey data are clearly showing the hesitancy of businesses to spend and invest given the macro headwinds facing the economy, with the biggest issue being trade, Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist with INTL FCStone told MarketWatch.\n\nWe ended 2018 with worries about growth and earnings, and in the first two days of 2019 we've received more bad Chinese data and an AAPL revenue guidance cut, Tom Essaye, president of the Sevens Report, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNeither of those events should be material surprises â€” China's been weak for a while and analysts have been cutting estimates on Apple for months â€” but if we're going to sustain a rally, this market needs actual good news, and there hasn't been much lately, he said.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nApple skidded 10% for its biggest one-day percentage decline since Jan. 24, 2013.\n\nShares of Best Buy Co. BBY, -0.41% fell 2.1% after analysts at UBS cut the retailer's stock price target to $57 from $70 on Apple's warning.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +0.83% stumbled 13% after the firm announced a $74 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Celgene Corp. US:CELG. Celgene shares were up 21%.\n\nShares of Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, -3.14% were down 8.9% after the company said revenue in December was lower than expected.\n\nHow did other markets trade?\n\nAsian markets closed broadly lower, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.50% , China's Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.17% and South Korea's Kospi 180721, -0.82% losing ground. Japan's markets were closed.\n\nEuropean markets fell, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.88% and the FTSE 100 UKX, +0.80% both in the red.\n\nCrude-oil futures extended gains, the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.07% retreated, and gold prices US:GCG9 settled higher.\n\nâ€”Mark DeCambre contributed to this article
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) â€” The Federal Reserve announced on Monday it transferred a record $117 billion in earnings to the U.S. Treasury during 2015.\n\nThe transfer is nearly 21% more than the prior record of $96.9 billion, set in 2014.\n\nThe transfer includes $97.7 billion in remittances, a side benefit of the U.S. central bank's earnings from its massive bond-buying purchases. The Fed's balance sheet now totals $4.5 trillion.
In an effort to combat fraudulent unemployment insurance claims, which have been rampant in some states during the pandemic, gig workers and self-employed workers will be required to provide documentation of their earnings to get unemployment benefits under the new stimulus package.\n\nGig workers and self-employed people aren't traditionally eligible for unemployment benefits, but under the CARES Act, they could receive benefits through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. To do so, they were only required to provide an estimate of their earnings.\n\nThat made it easier for states to process jobless applications, but under the new legislation it will by and large be a pain for state workforce agencies to process applications for PUA benefits, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy organization focused on workers' rights.\n\nAll states have been accepting documents [of past earnings], they just haven't been requiring them, she said. The Department of Labor hasn't formally specified what kind of documentation workers will be required to provide. A DOL spokesman told MarketWatch that the agency expects to have more specific guidance on documentation later this week\n\nIn guidance published on Dec. 30, three days after President Donald Trump signed the $908 billion stimulus package into law, the DOL stated only that individuals will be required to provide documentation substantiating employment or self-employment. It's most likely that states will ask claimants to provide a 1099 tax form, said Elizabeth Pancotti, a policy adviser at the pro-worker advocacy group Employ America.\n\nIt's also likely that state workforce agencies will have to devote a lot of time contacting people to gather that documentation, especially if they returned to work and were laid off again, Evermore said.\n\nImportantly, first-time applicants for PUA benefits will have only 21 days from the time they submit their application to submit documentation of their earnings, unless they are told otherwise by their state's labor department. People who were already receiving PUA before Dec. 27 will have 90 days to submit income documentation.\n\nThe legislation also provides some leeway for workers who may not have any formal documentation of their earnings if they can provide good cause for that lack of paperwork, Evermore told MarketWatch.\n\nIn addition to the 11-week extension of the PUA program, which otherwise would have expired if the new stimulus package hadn't passed, jobless Americans will also receive an additional $300 per week in federal unemployment benefits on top of their state-level benefits.\n\nRelated: When will Americans receive the extra $300 in unemployment benefits?\n\nJobless individuals in Arizona, California, New York, Louisiana, Rhode Island and Tennessee could begin to receive that additional aid this week, according to their state labor departments.\n\nIt could take another three to four weeks at a minimum for other states to begin making payments, Pancotti told MarketWatch.
Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester said Tuesday the central bank could continue its $120 billion per-month asset purchases through all of 2021 even if the economy improves in the second half of the year.\n\nIn a discussion with reporters, Mester noted that the Fed agreed in December that asset purchases would continue until there is substantial progress in meeting its twin goals of low unemployment and a 2% annual inflation rate.\n\nMester said substantial progress might not be reached even with a second-half economic recovery.\n\nEven if we get a strong second half of the year, I don't really anticipate that we'll necessarily be at that substantial progress, Mester said.\n\nWe'll have made some progress, but I probably want to see a little more, Mester said.\n\nMester said she is expecting a pretty weak first couple of months of the year and then improvement as more Americans get the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nEven with these ups and downs, Mester said Fed policy is in the right place.\n\nRead: Mester sees uneven 2021\n\nThe Fed has lowered its benchmark interest rate to zero and added $3 trillion of asset to its balance sheet.\n\nI'm happy with the way that policy is calibrated right now, she said.\n\nOn Monday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said a bond-buying recalibration could happen in 2021.\n\nThe Fed is buying $80 billion of Treasurys and $40 billion of mortgage-backed securities every month.\n\nMester said there could be tapering of the bond buying program if there is a stronger second half than she expects.\n\nIts really dependent on what you see from the economy. I would like us to taper asset purchases next year but it really depends on the economy, she said.\n\nWhile the bond market seems to expect inflation to rise, Mester said the economy's intrinsic dynamics suggest inflation is not going to move up quickly above 2%.\n\nThe Fed has said it will aim to overshoot its 2% target for a time to make up for the period of below target inflation.\n\nWill I be upset if inflation moves to 2.5%? Probably not, given that the inflation dynamics suggest that it's not going to move quickly, Mester said.
Economic conditions have evolved and are likely to warrant 'somewhat more regular' increases in short-term interest rates, said Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren on Monday.\n\nRosengren had been a big support of the Fed's ultralow monetary policy during the crisis.\n\nIn a speech to business leaders in Hartford, Conn., Rosengren said his switch to advocating more tighter monetary policy was due to the fact economic circumstances have evolved and now imply the need for a different stance of monetary policy.\n\nThe Boston Fed President, who is not a voting member of the Fed policy-making committee this year, forecast that the Fed would meet its twin goals of low unemployment and a 2% annual rate of inflation by the end of the year.\n\nAs a result, I believe that a still gradual but somewhat more regular increase in the federal funds rate will be warranted, he said.\n\nThe Fed has only raised interest rates twice over the past year. The central bank's latest projections call for three quarter-percentage-point hikes this year.\n\nMany outside experts are calling on the Fed to speed up the pace of rate hikes.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% is up 65 basis points since the election.\n\nRosengren said the recent movements in financial market prices should provide greater confidence that an increased pace of the gradual monetary policy normalization in the U.S. is appropriate.\n\nIn comments to reporters following his speech, Rosengren said that what happens with fiscal policy will play a role in the exact timing of rate hikes, according to Reuters.
As of Jan. 1, the Trump administration is requiring hospitals to publicly list standard charges for various procedures online to increase transparency around pricing, but for most people the listings might as well be written in another language.\n\nAs far as the chargemasters being made available online they will be of very little use to the majority of patients, said Caitlin Donovan, director and spokeswoman for National Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit based in Virginia. I doubt most hospitals went through to make these as consumer-friendly as possible.\n\nChargemasters are essentially long lists of hospital prices by procedure. They are now listed by hospitals online, usually in the insurance and billing category.\n\nStill, she said, the databases can serve as a starting point for consumers to compare baseline prices, which can vary widely. President Trump's goal with the public listings: They will ultimately help foster competition between hospitals and lower prices, whether through consumers comparison shopping or advocates comparing prices on patients' behalf.\n\nPrices for up to 40% of medical services can be reduced by comparison shopping, an August 2018 study from researchers at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia Universities found. Despite this, fewer than 1% of patients used price transparency tools â€” websites or apps where patients can look up the cheapest price on a given procedure â€” to find the best price for services in advance of medical procedures.\n\nData shows how widely costs can vary in one city for the same procedure.\n\nThe new policy comes as health-care costs are skyrocketing: in the past decade in the U.S., medical costs have increased 34%, outpacing income growth, which rose 20% over the same period, according to an analysis from personal-finance site NerdWallet.\n\nIt may take time for the transparency policy to have an effect on hospital prices. Donovan said the new policy will be useful immediately in one way: Advocacy groups looking at and analyzing where we are systemically with hospital pricing, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, here are some ways to make better sense of the listings:\n\nTalk to your health insurer\n\nThe price listed on the charge description master (CDM) represents the base price charged by the hospital for a health service, but it is rarely what a patient actually pays. Instead, patients should speak to their insurance company to find out the contracted rate the hospital charges the insurance carrier for the service and how much the patient needs to pay based on what has already been paid from their deductible.\n\nListings may include coding for different services that make very little sense to the average consumer, according to Donovan. Codes in one database at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, for example, read as HC ARC PLT AB DRUG INCUBATION ($931) and HC ARC SEPARATION BY DENSITY GRADIENT RETICS ($1095) and HC BME POST BM MONO ($1098). Those are incomprehensible to most people looking to compare prices, Donovan said. The best way to straighten out pricing dilemmas is to call your insurance company directly.\n\nExplore the possibility of financial aid\n\nIf you have insurance, the best way to find prices is to call your insurance company directly. If you don't, the CDM numbers may be a more accurate representation of what you actually have to pay, but in many cases you can also obtain financial aid from the hospital. Many hospitals will have a patient advocate or price-transparency officer you can speak with to find the exact cost of a procedure before going in to the facility.\n\nAlways keep in mind additional costs\n\nThe price of procedures listed in the chargemaster is just one small portion of what a patient is expected to pay to the hospital. For most procedures, other services are included in the final bill including facility fees, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and drugs, patient dietary and laundry services, and other support services like financial counseling and social services.\n\nPush for more comprehensive legislation\n\nThe debate over the usefulness of the CDM requirement underscores ongoing consumer and provider frustration with health-care billing, said Kristyn Brandi, an assistant professor at Rutgers University Medical School.\n\nIt is confusing from both a provider and patient perspective to navigate a system where costs are not as up front as they should be for people to be able to make decisions that are in their best interests, she said.\n\nDoctors often do not have a say in what patients are charged, as hospitals and insurance companies set the prices, she added. New systems of health-care coverage are being introduced in federal and private systems could force insurance companies to cover more procedures and eliminate some of the confusion.\n\nIt is difficult for doctors to deal with, Brandi said. We want to do what is best for our patients and recommend the services that are best for them â€” we don't want to think of costs when it comes to patients' lives.
The U.S. central bank can afford to take a wait-and-see stance on interest rates, said Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Thursday, joining the chorus of officials who say patience is the new watchword.\n\nWe begin the year as close to our assigned objectives as we have in a very long time. In these circumstances, I believe patience is a virtue and is one we can today afford, Clarida said, in remarks prepared for the Money Marketeers of New York University.\n\nRead:Fed chatter confirms interest rates on hold until May at earliest\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell and other senior Fed officials have said they favor stepping back until the central bank better understands the dichotomy between their basically upbeat view on the economic outlook and the distressed signal being sent by financial markets.\n\nSome Fed officials have said they expect the market turmoil to subside.\n\nSee: Fed's Evans says interest rates likely moving higher while others urge caution\n\nIn his speech, Clarida said that the central bank is facing crosswinds from growth prospects in other countries and overall financial conditions that have tightened materially.\n\nIf these crosswinds are sustained, appropriate forward-looking monetary policy should respond to keep the economy as close as possible to our dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability, he said\n\nIn a footnote, Clarida cited his prior research that said the Fed could offset exogenous declines in demand by promising fewer interest-rate hikes than the market had expected.\n\nAt the moment, the Fed has penciled in two interest-rate hikes this year.\n\nThe Fed vice chairman also said he was open to making adjustments to the steady shrinking of the central bank's balance sheet.\n\nSome analysts argue the balance sheet runoff is damaging financial markets.\n\nIf we find that the ongoing program of balance-sheet normalization or any other aspect of normalization no longer promotes the achievement of our dual-mandate goals, we will not hesitate to make changes, Clarida said.
When earnings season kicks off unofficially early next week, investors will focus on what companies expect for this year amid hopes that rising profits will provide the foundation for the stock market's next rally.\n\nCorporate executives will be under pressure to persuade Wall Street that U.S. businesses will see no more than a modest slowdown in earnings growth from their stellar pace last yearâ€”a tall order as trade tensions and the Federal Reserve's rate increases create potential profit headwinds. That's based on a note from Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, who says as long as companies manage that tricky feat, U.S. equities should rally this year.\n\nCompanies must convince investors that 2019 will show further earnings growth even as profit margins actually decline, wrote Colas in a Monday research report.\n\n\n\nSee: Here's why stock-market bulls are banking on January to steady the ship\n\nRead: Now that the bulls are back, it may be time to buy stocks again\n\nInvestors might be forgiven for dismissing earnings season as a big catalyst for equity markets. At the latter end of last year, Wall Street shook off a raft of stronger-than-expected earnings results, in part because fears of an impending recession and worries that earnings results in the future couldn't get any better.\n\nA Federal Reserve that was viewed as being overly ambitious in its attempt to normalize rates from crisis-era policy also was seen as a point of friction for investors, perhaps, amplified by dread that the U.S.-China trade spat would help to further gum up global economic expansion.\n\nStill, Colas says earnings guidance will prove crucial, as it may offer companies the opportunity to beat back downcast expectations in the aftermath of the sharp selloff last Thursday, sparked by Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +1.27% cut to its sales forecasts, which was blamed on Washington's dust-up with Beijing.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% are both tentatively higher at the year's start, but that comes after a disastrous month resulted in both benchmarks producing their worst Decembers since 1931.\n\nEquity strategists have cut their expectations for earnings-per-share, or EPS, growth for the S&P 500 but those Q4 estimates remain high, for 11.4% growth, down from 16.4% at the start of the fourth quarter, according to FactSet data.\n\nMore important, EPS for the broad-based index in 2019 overall is now expected to climb by 7.4% to $173.45 a share, from a more optimistic forecast of 10.2% three months ago.\n\nThat means if the S&P 500 remains at its Friday close of 2,532 and earnings estimates in 2019 pan out accurately, the index should trade at multiple of 14.6 times earnings in 2019. But if earnings fail to grow altogether, the index would trade at a price-earnings multiple, a popular way of valuing stocks, of 15.6 times earnings in 2019. To be sure, that would mark a substantial drop from around 20 times 12-month trailing earnings at the start of the year.\n\nAssuming earnings growth remains balanced between current expectations and those in which earnings growth grinds to a halt, stocks should still remain a buying opportunity, said Colas.\n\nBut there is no certainty that results will hearten the market, Colas cautions.\n\nDeclining margins and a possibly zero-growth Q1 are fundamental headwinds, as is the continued uncertainty over U.S./China trade. We are not, in other words, out of the woods just yet, he said.
Deaths of despair have risen during the coronavirus pandemic, and the latest research suggests the increase has been dramatic.\n\nThe pandemic and recession were associated with a 10% to 60% increase in deaths of despair above already high pre-pandemic levels, according to a working paper by Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago. These non-COVID excess deaths are disproportionately experienced by men aged 15-55, he found. Some health professionals, however, have said such estimates are both premature and overzealous in their projections.\n\nFrom March onward, excess deaths are approximately 250,000 of which about 17,000 appear to be a COVID under-count and 30,000 non-COVID. Deaths of despair â€” drug overdose, suicide, alcohol â€” in 2017 and 2018 are good predictors of the demographic groups with [non-COVID excess deaths] in 2020, Mulligan wrote in his paper, distributed this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\n 'Mortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes.'  â€” Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago\n\nMortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes. The demographic and time patterns of the non-COVID excess deaths (NCEDs) point to deaths of despair rather than an under-count of COVID deaths. They increased steadily from March to June and then plateaued.\n\nThey were disproportionately experienced by working aged men, including men as young as 15 to 24. Presumably social isolation is part of the mechanism that turns a pandemic into a wave of deaths of despair, Mulligan said. However, he did not speculate on how much, if any, comes from government stay-at-home orders or business closures to encourage social distancing.\n\nOn Thursday evening, President-elect Joe Biden said he will call for $1,400 stimulus checks and more vaccine funds in a $1.9-trillion coronavirus economic relief package when he takes office this month. One note of caution: Analysts say that after the proposal is debated in Congress, the final COVID-19 rescue package is unlikely to be as generous as currently proposed.\n\nAs of Saturday, COVID-19 had infected over 92.4 million people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, one of the major ways the virus has spread around the world so quickly, and killed over 2 million, including 394,413 in the U.S. The U.S. has the world's highest number of COVID-19 cases (23.7 million), followed by India (10.5 million), Brazil (8.4 million) and Russia (3.5 million), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe government's unemployment rate hovered at 6.7% in December, and the number of unemployed workers was 10.7 million. However, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, argues that a breakdown of government figures and other estimates based on those paint a far bleaker picture due to the business closures and public-health restrictions related to COVID-19: 26.8 million workers are being negatively affected â€” or nearly 16% of the workforce.\n\nStill, others advised caution on deaths of despair estimates. We do not actually know that these deaths are increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor of emergency medicine and public health at Brown University, and Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nIn an op-ed for the health site Stat, they said, Police and crisis hot lines may â€” or may not â€” be receiving extra calls for domestic violence and child abuse. Firearm homicide rates are staying steady. Suicides are certainly occurring, but there is no evidence to date that their rate is on the rise (and we may not know the impact of the pandemic on suicide for years to come).\n\nDespite ample evidence that anxiety is increasing during the pandemic, anxiety alone is rarely a driver for suicide. It is not even a risk factor for it, Ranney and Gold added. Right now it is all too easy to blame every tragedy on COVID-19. Science warns us, however, not to make this fundamental error of attribution.\n\nPeople are, of course, suffering economically. At the height of the pandemic in March, more than 30 million Americans were laid off or furloughed when the economy shut down to curb the spread of COVID-19. The unemployment rate at that point was 14.7%; it has since come down to 6.7%. The leisure and hospitality industries have been particularly hit hard by the pandemic.\n\nIn April, nearly 12 million low-wage workers were laid off, while some 6 million workers who were earning between $18 to $29 an hour were laid off. By November, all but 400,000 of those workers earning $18 to $29 an hour had returned to work, Raj Chetty, a Harvard economics professor, said. Meanwhile, some 6 million workers who earned less than $13 an hour have yet to return to work.\n\nMulligan measured actual deaths from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention file for 2020 that began on Jan. 26, and ended his calculations through week 40 â€” the week ending Oct. 3. COVID-19 deaths and actual total deaths were reported in this file. He defined excess deaths as the difference between actual total deaths and projected deaths, based on previous years.\n\nThe CDC reports 12-month moving sums of deaths from drug overdose, he wrote. During the nine months before the pandemic, each new moving figure of non-COVID excess deaths (or NCEDs) averaged 680 deaths more than the previous. In March 2020, however, they totaled 1,511 above the previous total.\n\n 'A complex constellation of risk factors, only a few of which are directly tied to COVID-19, are known to drive these tragic deaths.'  â€” Megan Ranney, an emergency physician, and Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist, writing in Stat\n\nThe same CDC data through May 2020 show that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are driving the increases. Given that men have a larger share of fentanyl-overdose deaths than prescription-opioid-overdose deaths, this suggests that men would be disproportionately represented among 2020 NCEDs, he concluded.\n\nSome health professionals warned earlier in the pandemic of a possible rise in deaths of despair in the U.S. as a result of the pandemic. Approximately 68,000 more people could die from drug or alcohol misuse and suicide, according to predictions released in May by Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care.\n\nProjections of additional deaths of despair ranged from 27,644, assuming a quick economic recovery and the smallest impact from unemployment, to 154,037, assuming a slow recovery and the greatest impact from unemployment. We can prevent these deaths by taking meaningful and comprehensive action as a nation, the researchers wrote in the report.\n\nMore Americans could lose their lives to deaths of despair, deaths due to drug, alcohol, and suicide, if we do not do something immediately, the report said. Deaths of despair have been on the rise for the last decade, and in the context of COVID-19, deaths of despair should be seen as the epidemic within the pandemic.\n\nHowever, Ranney and Gold said the projections in the Well Being Trust report should be taken with some serious caveats. These projections are based on data from the Great Recession, meaning the models weren't able to factor in the unique aspects of what is happening today, such as how new technologies make possible increased virtual social connection and support, they wrote.\n\nA complex constellation of risk factors, only a few of which are directly tied to COVID-19, are known to drive these tragic deaths, they wrote. We have evidence-based interventions that can reduce the rates of many of the risk factors for all of these deaths whether or not the country is practicing social distancing, hand-washing, and mask wearing.\n\nSource: Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care.\n\nThe question remains: Is putting America back to work sooner rather than later a Sisyphean task, the equivalent of rolling a rock perpetually uphill while more people die of COVID-19? Or does Sisyphus's task involve waiting while millions more people lose their livelihoods, only to find themselves among the long-term unemployed or underemployed, eventually succumbing to substance abuse and chronic depression, or worse?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% , S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.40% had a tumultuous 2020, and were lower Friday as investors effectively sold the news of Biden's more generous stimulus proposal, which had been widely anticipated. The market was also dampened by worries over the potential for tax increases and increased risk of more political unrest after last week's siege on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe federal government has not come anywhere close to vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, as it had pledged last year. Still, the vaccines are hoped to eventually provide herd immunity against the virus, helping people get back to work. BioNTech SE BNTX, -1.33% and Pfizer PFE, -0.11% said a final analysis of their vaccine candidate showed 95% rather than 90% efficacy. Meanwhile, Moderna MRNA, -5.43% said its vaccine candidate was 94.5% effective.\n\nA vaccine candidate from AstraZeneca AZN, +0.04% and the University of Oxford is safe and effective and showed an average efficacy of 70% in a pooled analysis of interim data, according to a peer-reviewed study. Efficacy was 62% for trial participants who received two full doses of the experimental vaccine, but increased to 90% among a subgroup of volunteers who received a half dose, then a full dose, according to the full late-stage clinical trial data published in The Lancet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that efforts to stem the rapid spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, are spiraling the economy into another Great Recession; the impact sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% ricocheting wildly before ending 2020 at a record high.\n\nThe federal government must fully support and invest in a plan to improve mental-health care, said Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer at the Well Being Trust. If we work to put in place healthy community conditions, good health-care coverage, and inclusive policies, we can improve mental health and well-being, he added.\n\nThe Well Being Trust is a national foundation dedicated to advancing the mental, social, and spiritual health of the nation. The Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care is an independent research unit affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians, and works to improve individual and population health by enhancing the delivery of primary care.\n\nTrump has vacillated between heeding the advice of public-health experts and bending to the views of his favored economists. MarketWatch photo illustration/Getty Images\n\nDon't miss: New estimates on coronavirus fatalities make for chilling reading as U.S. states ease restrictions on social distancing\n\nAnne Case and Angus Deaton, economists at Princeton University, first chronicled deaths of despair among middle-aged non-Hispanic Caucasians in a 2015 paper. They include deaths by suicide, alcohol poisoning, overdoses of opioids and other drugs, and cirrhosis of the liver. The CDC estimated that such deaths almost doubled since 1999, reaching 150,000 in 2017.\n\nSARS CoV-2 is having an unprecedented impact on the world. No one alive can recall any infection or worldwide event of such magnitude and scale, the Well Being Trust report added. Along with the tens of thousands of deaths in the United States from the virus, COVID-19 overlays the growing epidemic of deaths of despair threatening to make an already significant problem even worse.\n\nThe researchers issued a warning for the months and even years ahead, arguing for additional investment in health care and strategies to deal with the phenomenon. A preventable surge of avoidable deaths from drugs, alcohol, and suicide is ahead of us if the country does not begin to invest in solutions that can help heal the nation's isolation, pain, and suffering, they wrote.\n\nThe debate over the ramifications of a months-long shutdown of the American economy has been at times both emotional and sobering. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for more than three decades and one of the leading experts in the U.S. on infectious diseases, has repeatedly pleaded with people to socially distance.\n\nThe debate over the economy's survival vs. the public health emergency highlights, as well, the chasm between left and right on the American political spectrum. The left generally believes that strong social structures beget a stronger economy for all. The right traditionally follows the idea that a strong economic system begets strong social structures for all.\n\nRanney and Gold argue that drawing a line between deaths of despair and political policies to reduce social distancing is a crude one. It is also wrong to imply that reopening the country will, in and of itself, stop deaths of despair. Jobs may or may not rebound when social distancing rules are relaxed. Much of the decline in travel and eating in restaurants predated formal rules about social distancing.
HONG KONG (MarketWatch) â€” Those fearing that China is the big risk in the year ahead for global markets hope that the first trading day of 2016 does not set the tone for the rest of the year.\n\nBetween a 7% fall in shares that triggered new circuit breakers on the Shanghai SHCOMP, +0.51% and Shenzhen stock exchanges 399100, +0.81% and accelerated weakness in the yuan, there is ample fodder for China bears.\n\nThe question being posed anew is whether 2016 will be the year Beijing finally throws in the towel on its attempts to coerce multiple asset markets upwards, while its economy continues to sink in a sea of debt.\n\nWhile yet more weak industrial activity numbers from the Caixin China December PMI got the new year off to a flat start, the bigger concern is whether the leadership still has the will or the ability to continue holding up stock prices as its confronts ever more painful policy choices.\n\nChinese Markets Slammed Shut After Stocks Tumble\n\nThe black start to January trading had its roots in the controversial government intervention last summer to rescue stocks from a rout, which wiped over $4 trillion off share values and sent shock waves around global markets.\n\nThis appeared to have paid off after a subsequent partial market rebound, yet it always left a worrying overhang both from resulting heavy state ownership and the imposition of a six-month ban on major shareholders (over 5%) from selling positions.\n\nWith that six-month moratorium ending this coming Friday, investors were spooked that there could be an avalanche of pent-up selling.\n\nAnd this time around will the government still be around to come in as buyer of the last resort?\n\nLast week I wrote that as the value of both China's currency and equity markets are so dependent on government intervention, this presents an important and hard-to-quantify risk factor.\n\nMust read:China faces even more painful choices in 2016\n\nSome $500 trillion of foreign reserves were used up last year to support the yuan and money mobilized to buy stocks has been estimated at 5 trillion yuan or 10% of gross domestic product.\n\nThe beginning of the year already appears to signal that authorities are dialing back on intervention, at least to support the currency. The yuan trading fix on Monday was set a full 100 basis points lower, putting it below 6.5 to the U.S. dollar USDCNY, +0.07% for the first time in more than four years.\n\nAccording to Daiwa Research, today's yuan gap down is likely due to continued capital outflows and stronger yuan selling pressure after the holidays. They contend Beijing is trying to orchestrate an orderly currency adjustment lower, a view supported by the December change in moving to valuation based on a trade-weighted basket.\n\nBut the risk here is that it can be difficult to maintain control when expectations build that the currency is set on a depreciation path. This can lead to a snowball effect with capital outflows, says Daiwa.\n\nThe Japanese broker also forecasts that the dollar-yuan exchange rate could fall to 7.50 by the end of 2016. If a move of this size were to materialize you could still get a much less orderly exit out of the yuan and Chinese assets, including equities.\n\nWhile there have been various comments from officials that there is no need to devalue the yuan, it is notable that Chinese companies have been positioning for further currency weakness.\n\nAs well as a reduction in yuan deposits in Hong Kong and Taiwan, mainland Chinese companies have been buying commercial property in the territory, which gives exposure to the Hong Kong dollar USDHKD, +0.00% . Over the festive holidays there was unusual activity in the property market when an apartment sold at a record price of HK$594 million, or HK$100,000 per square foot.\n\nAnother reason to be alert for a shift in government policy is the recent comment by President Xi Jinping. He was quoted in the mainland press saying that China will face increasing challenges over the next five years for which strong stimulus to boost development is no longer the solution.\n\nThe priority for Beijing now appears to be restructuring its loss-making heavy industries, with painful commodity price falls showing few signs of easing up.\n\nAnalysts warn this will come with a large bill to clean up bad debts and provide support for laid-off workers.\n\nGiven these shifting priorities, it is hardly a stretch to conclude that it would be politically difficult for Beijing to keep extending unlimited funds to bail out equity investors.\n\nUltimately when Beijing created a market when it was the only buyer, it also placed itself in an extremely exposed position.\n\nIf investors suspect the state is no longer ready or able to step in, expect Chinese equities to fall fast.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped on Wednesday after early voting indicated Democrats were on track to win both Senate seats in Georgia and thus control of Congress, an outcome that would give the Biden administration more room to enact his policy agenda.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.663% was at a March high of 1.041%, 8.6 basis points higher than in the previous day. The 2-year note rate TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.133% edged 2.2 basis points up to 0.143%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.446% climbed 11.4 basis points to 1.819%, more than an eight month high.\n\nWhat's driving Treasurys?\n\nPreliminary voting results show Raphael Warnock won one of two Senate runoffs in Georgia early Wednesday, according to the Associated Press, bringing Democrats a seat closer to a Senate majority.\n\nAlso with 98% of the expected vote total reported, Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff was leading Republican Sen. David Perdue by just 0.4 percentage point.\n\nWith control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have more scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.\n\nIndeed, the 10-year note broke through the key 1% level that has contained the benchmark maturity since March.\n\nRead: U.S. bond market could face 'taper tantrum' risk after Georgia Senate runoffs, says Jefferies\n\nThe Treasury selloff slowed later in the session, however, after violent pro-Trump protesters broke into the U.S. Capitol building, forcing the halt of a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's presidential victory.\n\nIn U.S. economic data, Automatic Data Processing Inc. said private-sector employment fell by 123,000 in December, the first decline in 8 months, after increasing 304,000 in the previous month. Factory orders rose 1% in November.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's minutes from its December policy meeting showed only a small share of its 17 members of its interest-rate setting committee were in favor of expanding purchases of long-term Treasurys last month.\n\nWhat did market participants say?\n\nThe expected increase in spending translates into more back-end supply and higher inflation, hence the steeper curve, said Kevin Walter, co-head of Treasurys trading at Barclays.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The market's expectation that the Federal Reserve will only raise interest rates twice in 2016 are too low, said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer on Wednesday. We think they're too low, Fischer said in an interview with CNBC. The Fed's own forecast in its dot plot' are for four rate hikes this year. Fischer said this was more in the ballpark. He added that policy is not on automatic pilot. We don't know enough now to know how many [rate hikes] there will be, Fischer said, because the Fed will have to respond to events.
There was grumbling last fall when the Social Security Trusteesâ€”led by Steven Mnuchin, who is also the Secretary of the Treasuryâ€”said that the gargantuan program's cost-of-living increase would be just 1.3% in 2021.\n\nAdvocates said it wouldn't be enough to keep up with the true cost of living, and just days into the new year, it looks like they were right.\n\nAn analysis from GoodRx, a medical and health care services provider, calculates that 589 drugsâ€”all but seven brand medicationsâ€”now cost 4.2% more on average. That's nearly three full percentage points more than the cost of living hike Social Security gave seniors.\n\nRead: How to keep your New Year's resolutions â€” and not sabotage yourself\n\nHere's the bottom line on what you can now expect to pay for the 10 most commonly prescribed drugs:\n\nâ€¢ Eliquis (6.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Jardiance (6.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Tradjenta (6.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Truvada (4.8%)\n\nâ€¢ Chantix (5.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Flovent (3.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Spiriva (6.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Premarin (5.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Humira (7.4%)\n\nâ€¢ Symbicort (3.0%)\n\nMeantime, here are the biggest increases of other drugs:\n\nâ€¢ Marplan (14.9%)\n\nâ€¢ Cotempla XR (13.2%)\n\nâ€¢ Wavesense (13.1%)\n\nâ€¢ Neoprofen (10.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Cosmegen (10.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Desoxyn (10.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Nucynta (10.0%)\n\nâ€¢ Ryvent (9.9%)\n\nâ€¢ Onivyde (9.9%)\n\nâ€¢ Juxtapid (9.9%)\n\nA longer list of other medications and their new prices can be found here.\n\nThis has always been the problem, says Mary Johnson, a Social Security and Medicare policy analyst for The Senior Citizens League, a Virginia-based nonprofit advocacy group. Prescription drugs are the fastest-growing cost that we have in retirement. Prices are rising faster than inflationâ€”which is what Social Security is indexed toâ€”and this has been the case for years.\n\nRead: How to get a job in 2021 if you're over 50\n\nAmericans already pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world, Reuters reports, noting that most other developed nations have single-payer systems in which the government negotiates drug prices for its people.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden has proposed letting Medicare, the federal government's health insurance program, negotiate bulk pricing with the pharmaceutical industry. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, have indicated support for this.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned in 2016 on allowing the government to negotiate lower drug prices. But once in office, he encountered opposition from other Republicans who said lower drug prices would force drugmakers to cut back on research and development of new drugs. At the time, California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, currently the top Republican in the House, warned against opening the door to a government takeover of our prescription drug market.\n\nDrug prices that are rising faster than inflation is just one way that seniors are falling behind as 2021 begins.\n\nWe reported recently that Medicare reimbursement cuts of 1% to 10%, depending on the service, kicked in on New Year's Day. It's complicated, but essentially, here's the deal: statesâ€”virtually all are required to balance their budgets each yearâ€”have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession. Given that Medicaid spending is usually a topâ€”if not the topâ€”source of spending, states can be expected to slash what they give to hospitals, physicians, nursing homes and other providers.\n\nWhat makes this even worse is that for every dollar the states cut from Medicaid, it means less federal aid as well. That's because the federal government gives states money based on a percentage of how much the states are spending.\n\nAll of this, warns Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, could significantly reduce access to needed care. Such access, she warns, could be particularly troubling in rural areas that have been underserved to begin with.\n\nIt's things like theseâ€”higher prescription prices and the likelihood of reduced access to Medicareâ€”that contribute to the scary number of $285,000. According to an annual estimate by Fidelity Investments, that's how much the average couple retiring at 65 will likely need for health care, over the rest of their lives, beyond what Medicare/Medicaid pay.\n\nUsually, when I write about this, people comment that they only spend a few thousand dollars a year on health careâ€”if thatâ€”and therefore the Fidelity figure can't possibly be right. This is a mistake.\n\nWhat folks need to understand is that the vast bulk of health care spending typically comes in the latter stages of life, the last two or three years. Don't make the mistake of assuming that what you spend on health care at age 65 or 70 is suggestive of what you'll spend at, say, 80 or 85, if you're fortunate enough to make it that far. Don't underestimate this.\n\nWhat's on your mind, retirement-wise, as 2021 begins? Send your questions, comments and stories to me at RetireBetterMarketWatch@gmail.com.

That wasn't such a great start to the new year. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% slumped 1.5% to start the 2021 trading year, its worst single-day decline since Oct. 28.\n\nMaybe one day does represent a trend. Kirk Spano, the veteran newsletter writer of Fundamental Trends, writes that 2020 was buy the rumor, and 2021 will be sell the news.\n\nStocks, he says, need time to catch up to valuations, even accounting for zero interest rates. It's literally cheaper to start a company today than buy one. This might explain all the SPACs, he says, referring to the special-purpose acquisition companies that have surged in demand last year.\n\nImagine a world without COVID-19 and massive Fed liquidity injections. 2020 could very well have been a choppy year. Now, suddenly valuations are even higher and there's permanent damage to the economy that requires a prolonged rebuilding period, he says.\n\nSpano expects a choppy year with the S&P 500 reaching as high as 4,000 â€” a shiny round numbered object, as he calls it â€” but the index also falling to 3,000 or even lower. Besides consolidate, markets also need to separate out the struggling zombies, companies that can't meet their debt-servicing costs from profits, which could account for up to 40% of the S&P 500.\n\nThe Georgia Senate race could result in an initial decline if Democrats sweep, as investors start to price in higher taxes on the wealthy. But, he says, increased investment in infrastructure, education and health care will take the economy, and stocks, higher in that scenario.\n\nHe also says bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.89% is susceptible to toughened regulation from Treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen. I don't think governments and central banks would, or should, and maybe even can't, destroy bitcoin, but they can make life very, very difficult and lower priced, he says. There is also competition coming from the digital dollar, euro and yen that will have central bank backing.

The stock market has rallied since the presidential election on expectations fiscal-stimulus policies proposed by Donald Trump will benefit the economy. That might be justified, but that doesn't mean the stock market can continue to rally in the short run.\n\nLonger-term positive influences from fiscal-policy improvements, instead of monetary-policy stimulus, are clear. Still, those positives won't be immediate.\n\nPart of Trump's fiscal policy targets mainstream America, not asset classes such as the stock market, bond market and real estate as monetary stimulus does. That is largely why fiscal improvements can have lasting influence, though they take a long time to be realized.\n\nFiscal policies take time\n\nLaying the groundwork for new U.S. manufacturing jobs takes time; putting money in the hands of working-class Americans takes time; and getting them to spend more aggressively and invest that money takes even more time. That is sustainable, whereas monetary policy stimulus is not. So there is a huge added value to favorable fiscal policies.\n\nThe problem exists in the near, not the long, term. On a near-term basis, the hand-off from monetary-policy stimulus to fiscal-policy improvements can have a material adverse impact on asset classes.\n\nFurthermore, when monetary policy is tightening, as it is in the U.S., liquidity levels begin to dry up and fabricated demand influenced by monetary stimulus starts to abate. And when demand levels decline, the tolerance for risk in those asset classes drops along with it.\n\nTherein lies the issue at hand. When monetary policy tightens, it has an immediate negative influence on economic growth, while fiscal-policy improvements take a long time to work their way through the system. So although fiscal-policy improvements are necessary and attractive to the long-term health of the economy, the recent reaction of the stock market on expectations of some immediate positive influence is far too early.\n\nTrade wars hurt companies\n\nFurthermore, investors seem to be ignoring the risk associated with Trump's interest in negotiating better trade deals. The only way he can do this is to threaten a trade war with China and within NAFTA. If he does that, he needs those countries to believe that he is capable, and willing, to initiate a trade war for them to come to the table and renegotiate existing deals, or to make concessions. And that's the only way he will come out of those negotiations a winner.\n\nThe problem is, at least for the stock market, if he makes other countries believe that he is capable of implementing a trade war, the stock market will believe it as well, and trade wars are not healthy for companies' earnings growth.\n\nWe are extremely concerned that the stock market has reacted prematurely and that it is ignoring immediate risks. We recognize that there is monetary stimulus still coming from the European Central Bank, and in our opinion that is the only reason that the stock market is at a high 25 times earnings. Otherwise a material correction would be part of this warning.\n\nA decline of 5% to 7% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 Index SPX, -1.48% , the Nasdaq-100 NDX, -3.13% and the Russell 2000 Index RUT, -2.94% is therefore possible, based on what we have defined as the Trump dump, which may begin almost immediately.\n\nThomas H. Kee Jr. is a former Morgan Stanley broker and founder of Stock Traders Daily.\n\nRead next: The biggest risk as markets shrug at the Trump-Russia imbroglio
Treasury prices pared modest gains Wednesday, leaving yields slightly lower, after minutes of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting highlighted some division over the central bank's forecast for three rate increases in 2018.\n\nThe 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , which is the most sensitive to shifts in interest-rate expectations, edged up 1.2 basis point to 1.935%. The short bond has been up 12 of the past 16 trading sessions, according to WSJ Market Data Group.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% fell 2 basis points to 2.445%. The yield of the benchmark bond has been down four of the past six trading sessions.\n\nThe 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% slipped 2.9 basis points to 2.782%, and has fallen in six of the past eight trading days.\n\nBond prices move inversely to yields.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nThe minutes unveiled two camps, both uncomfortable with the Fed's December forecast of three rate increases in 2018â€”with one faction worried the pace might be too aggressive, while another feared it would be too slow.\n\nRead:Fed minutes show divide over forecast of three rate hikes this year\n\nAccording to CME Group data, market participants are expecting the next rate increase, after the Fed's recent quarter-percentage point increase to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%, to occur in March.\n\nWhat has been viewed as muted moves in Treasury yields come as the dollar, as gauged by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.03% , has been near its lows for September at 92.07, despite tax-cut legislation and other fiscal stimulus measures which were expected to boost the buck. The dollar regained some ground on Wednesday, extending gains in the wake of the minutes.\n\nTraders also focused on geopolitics, as thousands of people took to the streets of Iran on Wednesday, voicing support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, following what has been the largest wave of antigovernment unrest in almost a decade.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea reopened communications with its neighbor the South, highlighting signs of relaxed tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nWhat does the data show?\n\nThe December Institute for Supply Management manufacturing index came in at 59.7%, up from 58.2% in November and marking the strongest year for the activity gauge since 2004, according to FactSet. A figure above 50% indicates activity is expanding.\n\nThe Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8% in November, surpassing expectations for a 0.5% rise.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\nThe December ISM reading is the thin air of the high peaks, wrote Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Tim Quinlan, in a note. It is quite uncommon for the ISM index to remain so firmly in expansion territory for such a long period. The only other time in the past 40 years that the ISM came in at 58 or higher for this many consecutive months was a streak that lasted from November 2003 to August 2004.\n\nOverall, Fed officials re-affirmed at this meeting that they anticipate raising interest rates three times in 2018, matching the tightening in 2017, but we still anticipate that a slightly faster than expected rebound in core inflation will mean we eventually see four rate hikes in 2018, said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in a Wednesday note following the release of minutes.\n\nWhat other assets are in focus?
The Dow today just might close lower for a fourth straight session, as chatter about a Trump rally is repealed and replaced with talk about Trump volatility.\n\nYet so many people have been touting a sell-the-inauguration approach and unloading already, that it no longer looks like such a great strategy, says Jani Ziedins over at CrackedMarket.\n\nThe more people expect something, the less likely it is to happen, Ziedins writes. The slide in stocks could subside, and then the rally could resume after Friday's swearing-in ceremony, he says.\n\nSo what would be a smart and surprising move? Investors ought to hitch their wagons to a sector whose short-term breakout looks enticing, especially as few people seemed to be looking for it.\n\nThat's our call of the day, and it comes from Barron's technical analyst Michael Kahn. The gold mining sector is the slice of the market that he's sounding bullish about. He says it's a short-term call, but a long-term bull run can't be ruled out.\n\nThere are several reasons to like the biggest gold miners ETF GDX, -1.72% , based on its daily and weekly charts, Kahn writes in his latest Getting Technical column. On his daily chart shown below, the short-term trendline breakout is the No. 1 reason to get bullish, he says.\n\nBarron's\n\nThere is a good deal of room for the ETF to rally from its current level near $23.35, Kahn adds. The level that gold-stock bulls need to target is around $31.50, where the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF peaked in mid-2016.\n\nThe Barron's technician is not alone in talking up gold miners. One chart freak says GDX looks like a winner at this point, after failures last year. And the precious metal itself US:GCG7 has attracted upbeat takes here and there, with Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn among those backing gold GLD, -0.58% as a way to play the Trump presidency.\n\nKey market gauges\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.46% is trading slightly lower, the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% is roughly flat, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.02% is up modestly in morning action. That's after all three gauges sagged yesterday, with some pinning the slump on President-elect Donald Trump waving adios to a longstanding strong dollar policy.\n\nThe buck DXY, +0.41% is recovering somewhat from yesterday's slump, while oil CLG27, is losing ground.

Apple Inc. stock has taken a beating in recent months, but Chief Executive Tim Cook defended his company Tuesday, and expressed optimism that trade tensions with China would soon ease.\n\nApple shares AAPL, +1.27% have fallen by more than one-third since their peak on Oct. 3, and tumbled further last week after the tech giant warned of disappointing iPhone sales in its holiday quarter.\n\nBut in an interview Tuesday with CNBC's Jim Cramer, Cook said the company was still going strong, and its naysayers were full of bologna.\n\n The product pipeline has never been better. The ecosystem has never been stronger.  â€” Tim Cook, Apple CEO\n\nHere's the truth, what the facts are, Cook said about reports of slow iPhone XR sales, according to a CNBC transcript. Since we began shipping the iPhone XR, it has been the most popular iPhone every day, every single day, from when we started shipping, until now. . . . I mean, do I want to sell more? Of course I do. Of course I'd like to sell more. And we're working on that.\n\nApple's stock surged 1.5% in afternoon trade Tuesday, enough to pace the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA, -0.39% gainers. The stock has now bounced 7.6% since closing last Thursday at the lowest level since April 2017, while the Dow has 5.4% over the same time.\n\nSlower sales in China also contributed to Apple's lowered forecast, and Cook said Tuesday he believes that situation to be temporary.\n\nWe believe, based on what we saw and the timing of it, that the tension, the trade-war tension with the U.S. created this more-sharp downturn, he said.\n\nCook said he's very optimistic a trade deal between the U.S. and China will be reached.\n\nI think a deal is very possible. And I've heard some very encouraging words, he said.\n\nWhen Cramer asked Even of recent, right? Cook replied: Yes, yes, very recently. And I don't speak for them, obviously. I do talk with them. And I give them my ideas and thoughts, referring to the Trump administration's trade team.\n\nOn other subjects, Cook touted the success of its wearables and teased an upcoming service, possibly related to health care. You will see us announce new services this year. There will more things coming, he said. On the health care, in particular, and sorta your well-being, this is an area that I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind,' it will be about health.\n\nHe also took a shot at Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +1.53% , which Apple has been in litigation with over patent rights. The issue that we have with Qualcomm is that they have a policy of no license, no chips. This is, in our view, illegal, he said, claiming there have not been any settlement talks â€” a comment that Qualcomm later called misleading.\n\nI have an issue with some of their other tactics, Cook added, referring to a New York Times report that the chip maker used an opposition research firm to spread what he called fake news about potentially running for president in 2020, apparently to chill his relationship with the Trump administration. This is stuff that should be beneath companies. This is not how things should operate, he said.
Former Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin famously once said that the Fed is in the position of the chaperone who ordered the punch bowl removed just when the party was really warming up.\n\nBen Bernanke and, most recently, Janet Yellen have refilled the punch bowl several times over the past several years. And it seems that weary partygoers simply left the soiree before it had ended. Many analysts have characterized the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate increase as an inflection point in the financial markets, one that portends greater uncertainty and volatility.\n\nHeadlines such as Volatility Is the Name of the Game Heading Into 2016, and How to Navigate Volatile Stock Markets in 2016 have appeared in the past week. A recent Gallup poll indicated that 62% of U.S. investors are concerned with stock market volatility, up from 53% in February.\n\n Analysts predicting greater future volatility might be suffering from recency bias â€” the behavioral-finance phenomenon involving extrapolating the recent past into the future. \n\nIt seems that increased volatility is a foregone conclusion. While we indeed have witnessed volatile financial markets around the Fed announcement, what can we learn from market history about volatility in the long run following Fed rate hikes?\n\nIn Invest With the Fed, my co-authors, Gerald Jensen of Creighton University and Luis Garcia-Feijoo of Florida Atlantic University, and I studied the relationship between market volatility and monetary policy. The results will surprise many market observers.\n\nThe evidence on returns is fairly clear and expected. From 1966 through 2013, we found that the S&P 500 Index returned 15.2% during expansive monetary policy periods (when interest rates were falling) and only 5.9% during restrictive periods (when interest rates were rising). Falling rates have buoyed equity returns. While the magnitude of the return differences may surprise some people, the fact that equities have performed better when rates were trending downward is intuitive.\n\nAn examination of volatility, however, paints a much different picture. We found volatility in returns to the S&P 500 to be lower in restrictive monetary policy periods than in expansive monetary periods, as annualized volatility was 16.3% during expansive periods and only 14.4% during restrictive periods. Our research also shows that downside risk in equities was similar during expansive and restrictive periods. Specifically, investors had about a one-in-10 chance of experiencing a one-month loss of 4.5% or more in both expansive and restrictive conditions.\n\nIt wasn't just equities that showed lower volatility in restrictive monetary conditions. Treasury bonds, high-yield bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) also experienced less volatility in the past when the Fed was hiking rates.\n\nPerhaps those analysts predicting greater future volatility are simply suffering from recency bias â€” the behavioral-finance phenomenon involving extrapolating the recent past into the future. It may serve investors well to look a little further back into history before forming expectations following the Fed rate hike. Returns may indeed be lower in the near future, but it may not be as volatile a ride as many anticipate.\n\nRobert R.

U.S. stocks on Monday closed higher, building on Friday's powerful rally, as investors watched for further signs of a thaw in the protracted trade dispute between the U.S. and China â€” a tit-for-tat clash that has weighed on investor sentiment.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% rose 98.19 points, or 0.4%, to finish at 23,531.35, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% advanced 17.75 points, or 0.7%, to 2,549.69. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% jumped 84.61 points, or 1.3%, to 6,823.47.\n\nRead: Now that the bulls are back, it may be time to buy stocks again\n\nOn Friday, stocks rallied, with the Dow jumping 3.3%, the S&P 500 index up 3.4% and the Nasdaq soaring 4.3%.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nSenior officials from China unexpectedly showed up for negotiations between Beijing and their counterparts in Washington in an effort to resolve longstanding trade disagreements that have triggered uncertainty in global markets.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He, a top economic adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping, was among attendees, sparking some optimism given the symbolism of a top-level bureaucrat attending the talks, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTrade officials from both countries are looking to hammer out an agreement over the next 48 hours, but there are doubts over how to best ensure that both countries follow through on promises made during talks with Trump administration worried about enforcement.\n\nInvestors are also keeping an eye on the partial government shutdown, now in its 17th day, with some government employees expected to see their first missed paycheck as a result of an impasse between President Donald Trump and Democratic lawmakers over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.\n\nElsewhere, British Prime Minister Theresa May set a Jan. 15 date for a parliamentary vote on her plan for exiting from the European Union, which she is widely expected to lose.\n\nWhat data were in focus?\n\nThe U.S. services sector expanded at the slowest pace in five months in December, according to the latest reading of the Institute for Supply Management's nonmanufacturing index, released Monday.\n\nThe index fell to 57.6% in December, from 60.7%, and below economists expectations of 58.7%, according to a MarketWatch poll. Nevertheless, any reading of 55% or more is considered exceptional, so the report reflects brisk business even as conditions have worsened slightly.\n\nA report on factory orders for November has been delayed due to the government shutdown, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak at 12:40 p.m. ET, kicking of a week when several members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee will offer their views on the economy and central-bank policy.\n\nWhat were strategists saying?\n\nThe backdrop for stocks is positive, with earnings growth still projected to be healthy, while the Fed looks like it is pausing, Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors, told MarketWatch.\n\nStill, there are a number of risks reappearing, like ongoing U.S.-China trade talks and the government shutdown, foreshadowing how well the government will be able to tackle important issues like the debt ceiling and the budget, he said, adding that investors may be applying a 'discord discount' to equity valuations as they hedge against the threat of gridlock leading to lasting economic damage.\n\nThe start of trading in the New Year has been ugly as companies begin to sound the earnings alarm, an obvious impact of the trade war. While we do expect a decrease in overall profits, it is obvious that multinationals will bear the brunt of the trade war as earnings miss their forecast, wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, in a research note.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nGeneral Electric Co. GE, -1.50% shares rose 6.2% following reports of talks with Apollo Global Management to sell its jet-leasing unit.\n\nShares of Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +0.92% gained 0.5% on news that the pharmaceutical giant would acquire Loxo Oncology Inc. US:LOXO in an $8 billion deal. Loxo stock soared 66%.\n\nPG&E Corp. PCG, +0.17% stock tumbled 22% on a Reuters report that the utility company was considering filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\nShares of Luxoft Holdings Inc. US:LXFT jumped 82% after it was announced the company would be acquired by DXC Technology DXC, -3.87% for $2 billion. DXC shares closed mostly unchanged.\n\nMattel Inc. MAT, +0.60% stock rallied 7.7%, after the toy company announced a partnership with the internationally-famous Korean boy band BTS.\n\nShares of Dollar Tree Inc. DLTR, -0.24% gained 5.5% after Starboard Value LP announced its nominations for the company's board of directors.\n\nHow were other markets trading?\n\nAsian markets gained with Japan's Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.18% , China's Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.17% , and Hong Kong's Hang Seng HSI, +0.50% all closing higher on the day.\n\nIn Europe, stocks were broadly lower with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.88% retreating 0.2%.\n\nCrude-oil futures US:CLG9 rose more than 1%, while gold prices US:GCG9 settled slightly higher and the dollar DXY, +0.07% fell.\n\nâ€”Mark DeCambre contributed to this report
It could be a classic sell the fact moment for the stock market.\n\nA postelection rally that carried the Dow Jones Industrial Average within a whisker of a round-number milestone and took other major indexes to all-time highs might be losing steam, leading some analysts to anticipate a near-term top that could roughly coincide with the inauguration of Donald Trump on Jan. 20.\n\nExpectations that the president-elect's administration will follow through on pledges to slash regulation, cut corporate taxes and boost infrastructure spending have contributed to the Trump trade, boosting stocks and triggering a sharp rotation into sectors expected to draw outsize benefit from those policies. Government bonds, like the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% , sold off sharply on expectations for bigger deficits, stronger growth and higher inflation.\n\nOf course, there's also the possibility that a building consensus for an inauguration day top turns out to be a contrarian indicator of its own.\n\nBut there are signs the Trump trade is losing some of its mojo.\n\nSee:Here's the right way for stock-market investors to trade Trump in 2017\n\nBonds have partially rebounded, pulling yields down somewhat. Stocks pulled back modestly on Monday. The S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% finished last week up more than 6% from its Election Day close, while the Dow DJIA, -0.46% on Friday topped out just 0.37 point short of the technically insignificant but possibly emotionally relevant 20,000 level.\n\nRead:What Dow 20,000 means for stock-market investors\n\nMoreover, analysts pointed to weakening stock-market breadth, with declining stocks outnumbering advancing stocks, at the end of last week even as the S&P 500 index notched a record:\n\nAlso:\n\nAndrew Adams, analyst at Raymond James, also noted that while the S&P 500, which is weighted by market capitalization, notched a record, the same index didn't follow suit when all its components are given an equal rating (see chart below). Also, small-cap stocks, which led the postelection charge, have lost some of their fizz.\n\nRaymond James\n\nAll in all, market breadth does seem to be slumping a bit, which is often a preamble to weakness in the major averages, and we could start to see traders position themselves for [a] short-term trading top coinciding with the inauguration, Adams said, in a note.\n\nThat means investors looking to take profits and reduce equity exposure might have a good opportunity to do so this week, he said.\n\nThe anticipated weakness shouldn't have any significant impact for more long-term investors, and those who missed out on the postelection rally might finally have a chance to buy in, but it is cause to remain vigilant, Adams said.\n\nHe noted that he still sees a big test for the S&P 500 at the 2,280-to-2,285 area, arguing that failure to rise above that resistance area could make for limited upside in the near term.\n\nSee:Stock-market bulls could get scorched by 'Icarus trade' in 2017\n\nA top near inauguration day would be a textbook illustration of the old investment adage: buy the rumor, sell the fact. The saying reflects the notion that by the time an anticipated event occurs, investors have already factored it into prices.\n\nIndeed, that's largely the argument made by Morgan Stanley analysts last week. What increasingly optimistic news are going to start embedding in our earnings outlook post-inauguration that hasn't already been contemplated, analysts led by Adam Parker said in a note.\n\nThere is also the concern that Trump-inspired gains have factored in all the policy positives while ignoring the potential pitfalls that could accompany rising trade tensions with China and others.\n\nAnd skeptics question whether the perceived positives are as bullish as investors assume.\n\nYou can't sit on the sidelines as the Trump rally continues, but you have good reason to question its durability, wrote analysts at Montreal-based Pavilion, in a Monday note. The president-elect's tax plan will do little to boost growth, and will largely benefit high earners, crimping consumption and dramatically eroding fiscal balances.\n\nSo far, the S&P 500 is on track to post its largest Election Day-to-Inauguration Day rise since Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election victory, which saw an 8.8% rally.\n\nSee:How stocks have performed between Election Day and inauguration since 1928\n\nTrump-inspired bulls are confident that the incoming president's policies will boost business confidence and unleash animal spirits, clearing the way for further upside.\n\nI think President Trump is going to downsize government, cut out many of our 'free lunch' programs and provide growth through the decrease in corporate and personal taxes and the closing of many tax loopholes, said Mark Grant, chief strategist at Hilltop Securities, in a Monday note.  I also believe that we will be exporting oil and natural gas in short order and that those revenues will help close the funding gap as new infrastructure projects are initiated.\n\nKirk Spano:The Trump trade and why oil might soon reach $100 again
Your physical attributes could have an impact on your participation in financial markets, according to a study of nearly 40,000 people entitled Stature, Obesity and Portfolio Choice and published in the journal Management Science. Specifically, we find that individuals who are relatively tall and of normal weight are more likely to hold stocks in their financial portfolios, the authors found.\n\nâ€¢ Obese people participate much less in the stock market than those who are average weight and are also more likely to favor less risky investments when they do.\n\nâ€¢ Overweight Americans are roughly 10% less likely than average weight people to participate in the stock market, while tall people are about 7.5% more likely to do so, he says.\n\nThe relationship is one of correlation rather than causation, and experts point to access to education and, often times, more expensive fresh food, says Jawad Addoum, the study co-author and an assistant professor of finance at Cornell University.\n\nObesity and poverty appear to go hand-in-hand, previous research has found. Although high-income countries have greater rates of obesity than middle- and low-income countries, previous research has found, in contrast to international trends, people in America who live in the most poverty-dense counties are those most prone to obesity.\n\nWhy are the two connected? It has been suggested that individuals who live in impoverished regions have poor access to fresh food. Poverty-dense areas are often times called food deserts,' implying diminished access to fresh food, according to a 2011 study in the journal Diabetes.\n\nCan a Mediterranean Diet Alleviate Depression?\n\nThere is also a lower average education among the obese â€” studies show that individuals who are obese are more likely to have lower levels of educational attainment â€” which may also explain part of the reason why they are less likely to invest in the stock market.\n\nAny association between obesity and education is likely to be mediated by social factors, just like the relationship between obesity and stock market investments, according to research by the U.K.-based Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre, a research institution that's part of the University of London.\n\nStigmatization, bullying, low self-esteem and young people's exclusion from opportunities for social interaction are suggested as underlying any relationship between obesity and lower educational attainment, they found.\n\nDon't miss:Retailers seek answers to 'food desert' problem\n\nThese social factors can have long-reaching implications. The reasons tall people participate in the stock market at high levels may be related to how they were treated by others during their teenage experience and social stigma about being overweight as adults.\n\nThese were formative experiences for many people. (Previous studies have shown that bullying early in life can have an impact on adult mental health.)\n\nAnd the opposite seems to be true too. If you were tall throughout most of high school (as many tall people were) you were even more likely to participate in the stock market as an adult. Addoum says that those who were tall in high school tended to have higher self-esteem in high school.\n\nYou are more likely to think things will work out (including your investments), which may make you feel better equipped to invest in risky things like stocks, he said.
S&P Global Ratings on Thursday cut Brazil's long-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings by one notch to 'BB-' from 'BB'. The outlook on the ratings is stable. The stable outlook reflects our view that there is a less than one-in-three likelihood that we could raise or lower the ratings on Brazil over the coming year, said credit analyst Lisa Schineller in a statement. It also is indicative of Brazil's stable external position and the strength of its monetary policy that help to offset fiscal weakness and lower economic growth outlook than its peers. BB- is generally viewed as speculative by lenders.
In a move showing House Democrat interest in moving beyond Obamacare, the chairman of the House Budget Committee is asking the Congressional Budget Office to set out the parameters of how a single-payer system would work.\n\nThe request, from House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, is notable in that it's not asking the CBO to provide a cost estimate.

The Dow industrials on Wednesday closed at the lowest level of 2017, marking a fourth straight day in the red for the blue-chip gauge, but the broader stock market managed modest gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% traded within a 89-point range, and finished down 22.05 points, or 0.1%, at 19,804.72, its lowest close of 2017. Shares of Dow component UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, +2.80% , off 1.8%, and Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, -4.31% , down 1.2%, offset roughly 1% gains in American Express Co. AXP, -1.45% and Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, -0.69% .\n\nThe S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% , closed up 4 points, or 0.2%, at 2,271.89, with a downdraft in telecom shares capping gains in the banking sector. Shares of Morgan Stanley MS, +0.10% Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.61% , and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.65% all closed higher.\n\nHowever, some of the most prominent financial names reporting quarterly results Wednesday ended lower, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.88% finishing off 0.6 % after the investment bank reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% finished 1.7% lower after reporting quarterly revenues that were slightly weaker than expected.\n\nFinancial stocks have led a torrid postelection rally that took the Dow within a hair's breadth of psychologically milestone of 20,000. But they have stalled along with the rest of the equity market.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% finished up 16.93 points, or 0.3%, at 5,555.65.\n\nWall Street trading over the past several days has been subdued as investors await signs that the stock-market rally that followed President-elect Donald Trump's November election victory, supported by his campaign promises to increase fiscal spending, cut taxes and roll back regulations, is based in reality and underpinned by solid corporate quarterly results.\n\nMike Antonelli, an equity sales trader at R.W. Baird & Co., said global stocks would likely remain placid until investors have a better picture of the fourth-quarter earnings environment and companies' outlooks for 2017, as well as Trump's plans. Trump will be sworn in to office on Friday.\n\nThe bulk of S&P 500 firms will release their earnings in the coming weeks.\n\nRetail shares have been in focus in recent weeks, suffering on reports of tepid holiday sales. On Wednesday that trend continued, with Target Corp. TGT, +0.68% shares closing down 5.8% after the retailer warned that its fourth-quarter earnings would be weaker than previously anticipated after a tough holiday season. That news sparked a selloff that spread throughout the sector.\n\nThe story coming out of retail hasn't been good, said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Asset Management, adding that individual stories will likely continue to influence the broader sector.\n\nOn Wednesday, the dollar recovered from Trump's comments on Tuesday, who said a strong dollar can harm the U.S. economy. The U.S. Dollar index DXY, +0.41% rose 0.9% to 101.26.

Headlines calling for the elimination of student debt have recently grabbed attention as U.S. policymakers seek solutions for a broken system of higher-education financing and ways to help overly burdened students.\n\nWhile some form of relief may make sense during this time of economic uncertainty, such one-off proposals fail to get at the root of the current crisis and may cause new problems, including issues around fairness, effectiveness and moral hazard, if larger systemic issues aren't solved in tandem with the forgiveness.\n\nA more responsive and comprehensive approach would focus on enhancing systemic transparency with respect to education outcomes, costs, and opportunities, and also improving lenders' underwriting practices for student borrowers. Outcomes should be presented in clear and standardized formats, and government and private lenders should be considering expected future incomes before offering a student various levels of debt.\n\nIndeed, the core structural problem is that the federal government writes blank checks for education programs regardless of whether the field of study is demanded or will yield a future income capable of allowing the student to repay his or her debt. In effect, the government does not conduct an ability to repay test. Even without new debt relief efforts, a recent study determined that under current policy the U.S. government (and accordingly the American taxpayer) should already expect to lose more than $400 billion in unpaid existing student loans.\n\n\n\nA former Treasury official from the Obama administration noted that there's no market discipline here . . . In 2007-2008, we saw a lot of lenders who were making risky bets going under. There's no force like that in the student-loan market.\n\nThe failure to consider real-world data and outcomes around higher education financing does a massive disservice to students and to the U.S. economy. Students, especially when pursuing graduate programs, may incur debt without receiving information needed to make informed decisions. Neither the student nor the government lender is assessing the borrower's true ability to repay.\n\nFor example, the average amount of student debt incurred by 2019 law graduates from Golden Gate University who had borrowed was $142,667, yet only 22% of graduates from the 2016 class held long-term, full-time jobs where bar passage is required. 40% of that graduating class is unemployed.\n\nAdditionally, by failing to anchor decisions around higher education and financing to outcomes and job market data, current structures are further exacerbating the skills gap plaguing the U.S. economy. Specifically, labor shortages have become a chronic problem in key economic sectors, including transportation, skilled trades, cybersecurity/IT, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe solution to poor student- and labor-market outcomes is straightforward: Provide transparency around expected higher-education outcomes. Especially in the context of professional and skills-based programs, what might one expect in terms of increases in future income? What percentage of graduates attain employment? What are the necessary skills for both the current economy and economy of the future?\n\nFor their part, policymakers should facilitate the compilation and publication of this type of data through dedicated research efforts. By collaborating with private-sector stakeholders, including schools and lenders, governments at both the state and federal level can support the dissemination of information that allows for better decision making and resource allocation.\n\nSchools must be accountable and honest in how they share information with prospective students. One approach would be to provide a disclosure form akin to a consumer loan disclosure.\n\nLenders must also be responsible in extending credit, including by considering a borrower's ability to repay a loan through an analysis of debt-to-future-expected income. For graduate and professional education this ability to repay requirement should guide both private lenders and the federal government.\n\nThe country is at a critical juncture with respect to policy around higher education and its financing. One-time solutions such as loan forgiveness, while well-intentioned and desperately needed by many, do not alone solve underlying problems. We need to be honest and transparent with students, educators, and employers so that all can make informed decisions.\n\nAngela Ceresnie is CEO of Climb Credit, a student lending and payments platform\n\nMore: The new stimulus bill didn't extend the student-loan payment pause â€” but it has 8 provisions that will affect how families pay for college\n\nAlso read: Under President Biden, expect more aggressive oversight of the student-loan industry
Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market. On Wednesday, the VIX also tipped higher on the heels of Trump's conference.
U.S. stocks eked out small gains Monday, after dipping in and out of negative territory as a deepening rout in oil prices hit the energy sector on the heels of the worst weekly start ever to a new year.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a three-day losing streak, bouncing after posting the largest declines for the first five days of a new calendar year in history. But a 6% plunge in oil prices hit energy and materials stocks, limiting gains on the main indexes.\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% rose 1.64 points, or less than 0.1%, to end at 1,923.67. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38% added 52.12 points, or 0.3% to settle at 16,398.57. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.27% ended the day down 5.64 points, or 0.1%, at 4,637.99, falling for the eighth consecutive session.\n\nThe Russell 2000 RUT, -0.55% dipped into bear-market territory earlier in the session, but closed off session lows, down 3.54 points, 0.3% at 1,042.64, according to preliminary data on FactSet. The index fell 1.3% intraday to 1,032, tumbling 20% below its all-time high, set on June 23, 2015â€”a move which meets the widely used definition for a bear market.\n\nA fresh rout in oil prices pulled energy-related stocks lower, with the energy sector leading the S&P losses, down 2% on the day and 8.8% since the beginning of the year. The U.S. oil benchmark finished under $32 for the firs time since December 2003, adding to worries about the commodity's inability to stabilize.\n\nMaterials were the second-worst performing sector, down 1.6% on the day and 9.3% since the beginning of the year.\n\nRead: Oil could fall toward $20, but not for the reason you think\n\nThe general risk aversion hit other sectors that are typically viewed as risky though not directly related to oil, most notably biotech IBB, -1.06% , which dropped 3.4% on Monday on the heaviest trading volume in more than two months.\n\nIt is highly unlikely that the stock market will begin to rally in any significant way until oil prices find some measure of stability, said James Meyer, chief investment officer at Tower Bridge Advisors, in emailed comments.\n\nAlso read: Bearish J.P.

Alcoa Inc. AA, +4.28% shares jumped 2.5% in after-hours trading, after the company's fourth-quarter release beat expectations. Alcoa's shares closed down 0.9% Monday after the aluminum producer said it would announce a $1.5-billion long-term supply contract with General Electric Inc.'s GE, -0.18% aviation unit on Monday.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, -1.84% shares closed 1.6% higher after the technology giant was upgraded at Mizuho Securities, which said it believes the recent selloff has left investors with meaningful upside potential.\n\nShire PLC US:SHPG shares lost 8.9% after the company said Monday it has agreed to buy Baxalta Inc.

The U.S. dollar gave up gains scored in the wake of a stronger-than-expected December jobs report after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would take a patient approach to monetary policy.\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was off 0.1% at 96.168 after surging as high as 96.60 following data that showed the U.S. added 312,000 new jobs in December, far exceeding the consensus forecast of 182,000 produced by a MarketWatch survey of economists. The unemployment rate rose to 3.9% from a 49-year low of 3.7% as the percentage of working-age Americans in the labor force climbed to a five-year high.
U.S. stocks closed higher for a fourth session Wednesday, with the S&P 500 in its longest winning streak since Sept. 14, on reports that the U.S. and China have narrowed differences over trade. Minutes from the December's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which indicated caution on future interest rate hikes, also helped to buoy sentiment.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% DJIA, -0.39% rose 91.67 points, or 0.4%, to 23,879.12, its best series of gains since Nov. 8, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% climbed 10.55 points, or 0.4%, to 2,584.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% advanced 60.08 points, or 0.9%, to 6,957.08.\n\nMajor indexes ended off intraday highs but the S&P 500 and the Dow are moving closer to levels to exit correction territory.\n\nWhat drove the market?\n\nAsian and European stocks rallied, with U.S. oil prices climbing above $50 a barrel, on optimism over trade talks between the U.S. and China. The latest round of talks wrapped up Wednesday, with investors zeroing in on some positive chatter.\n\nA Bloomberg report that cited White House sources saying President Donald Trump was eager to see a China deal helped to drive gains for stocks.\n\nHowever, ratings company Fitch warned that the U.S. could lose its triple-A sovereign credit rating if government dysfunction leads to brinkmanship over the country's debt limit. The warning came as a partial U.S. government shutdown continued and after a televised speech Tuesday night by Trump failed to narrow differences between the White House and Democrats over the administration's demand for funding to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nInvestors gorged on a heavy diet of policy commentary.\n\nThe release of Fed minutes revealed that some central-bank officials hard reservations about an interest-rate increase last month due to market volatility, though policy makers voted unanimously in favor of the move. They also recommended the Fed should be patient and stressed that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening is appropriate.\n\nSt. Louis Fed chief and FOMC voter James Bullard said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal we've got a good level of the policy rate today, adding that there isn't an immediate need to raise rates any higher, while he is open to cutting rates if the economy slowed.\n\nAtlanta Fed Chief Raphael Bostic, a nonvoting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, said the central bank should be patient about lifting rates given worries about tariffs and other signs of stress in the market.\n\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans, a voter, said that he sees as many as three hikes going forward, while arguing the Fed is likely to eventually move monetary policy into restrictive territory. He said that the central bank could wait as much as six months before making their first rate increase.\n\nWhat were analysts saying?\n\nLarry Benedict, CEO of the Opportunistic Trader, told MarketWatch that we're in the midst of a buy panic. Investors are pricing in all good news on all fronts, and shrugging off the negative.\n\nBenedict warned that the nearly 10% jump in the S&P 500 since Dec. 24 puts markets at fair value right now, and maybe a little high, a dynamic that could set stocks up for a fall in the event of bad news on the trade front or as earnings season begins.\n\nThe extension of U.S.-China trade talks to a third day was interpreted by the markets as a sign of progress, said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note.\n\nComments coming from both parties continue to indicate that the talks are, so far going 'very well.' A deal is likely to still be a long way off, with many twists and turns still to overcome along the way, he said. However, the extension is a step in the right direction, sending a signal that the two sides are in serious negotiations and are working hard to resolve the issues.\n\nWhich stocks were in focus?\n\nShares of Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, -2.05% jumped 13% after the oil-and-gas company provided a fourth-quarter production outlook that was above expectations.\n\nTechnipFMC PLC FTI, -5.16% stock gained 2.6%, after the oil-field services company announced a six-year offshore agreement with Saudi Aramco.\n\nShares of Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, +0.33% slumped 12% after the beer, wine and spirits company issued disappointing guidance for fiscal 2019.\n\nAcuity Brands Inc. AYI, -2.17% shares fell 2.8% even after the lighting and building management company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and sales that rose above expectations.\n\nApple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% shares rose 1.7%. Reports indicated that the tech behemoth was set to cut iPhone production by 10% this quarter. But Chief Executive Tim Cook, during a CNBC interview on Tuesday, described the long-term health of the company as never been better, and said the ecosystem around the company's roster of products has never been stronger.\n\nRead: Apple remains a dominant market force, even with all its China woes\n\nWhat were other markets doing?\n\nTrade-inspired optimism was credited with lifting global equity markets.

European equities were also higher, with the Stoxx 600 Europe index SXXP, +0.88% up 0.5%.\n\nOil futures rose, with the U.S. benchmark US:CLG9 emerging from a bear market, and closed well above $50 a barrel, while gold futures US:GCG9 settled higher and the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% traded sharply lower.\n\nâ€”Barbara Kollmeyer and William Watts contributed to this article
Several of the most popular Trump trades have either stalled or reversed in recent weeks â€” a sign that the market's postelection exuberance is beginning to wane.\n\nOn Thursday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% touched its lowest level since Nov. 30, putting it on track to notch a fourth straight week of declines. For those who are unfamiliar with bond-market dynamics, keep in mind that yields move inversely to prices.\n\nGold, which tanked after the election as the inflation trade reasserted itself, hit its highest levels since late November on Thursday. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has drifted lower over the past two weeks, with the ICE U.S. Dollar index DXY, +0.41% , a widely watched gauge of the buck's value versus its biggest rivals, is trading at its weakest level in a month.\n\nRead: Is it finally time for the inflation trade?\n\nFurthermore, the torrid equity rally that followed the election has effectively stalled. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , which only recently came within a hair's breadth of 20,000, has retreated.\n\nAll of these trades are, fundamentally, driven by the same factor: The expectation that Trump's policies will spur growth and stoke inflationary pressures if his administration slashes corporate taxes, embarks on a massive spending program and rolls back regulation as speculated.\n\nBut investors have only a vague idea of the details of each proposed policy, and the approximate timing is difficult to gauge. And this is increasingly becoming a problem for investors.\n\nStocks\n\nFinancial stocks rose 20% between election day and Dec. 20, accounting for the bulk of the run-up in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% . But they've retreated in the new year.\n\nIn contrast, health-care shares shook off their sluggish postelection performance in the new year. but that trend came to an abrupt end on Wednesday when Trump accused pharmaceutical companies of getting away with murder by manufacturing drugs abroad. Though they remain on track for their best weekly performance since the election.\n\nBut Trump isn't the only factor impacting stocks: investors are also exiting positions ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings season, which is about to begin in earnest.\n\nWhile economic data suggest that global economic growth is improving, the outlook for earnings remains unclear, said John Canally, an investment strategist and economist at LPL Financial.\n\nIt isn't just Trump, Canally said. There are other things going on here.\n\nBonds\n\nTreasury prices had been drifting lower since the summer, but the trend accelerated after the election as investors bet that the fiscal stimulus promised by Trump would alleviate some of the pressure on the Federal Reserve, allowing them to raise interest rates more swiftly.\n\nFed policy makers raised their median forecast for the number of rate increases in 2017 to three in December, up from two previously. But minutes from the central bank's December meeting revealed that many officials are still cautious.\n\nOn Thursday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he believes growth and interest rates will remain low in 2017, in part because any Trump-sponsored stimulus efforts likely won't arrive until 2018 or 2019.\n\nThis bond-market reversal is setting investors up for an interesting showdown, said George Goncalves, head of fixed-income strategy at Nomur, between real moneyâ€”a Wall Street term for mutual fund and pension fund investorsâ€”versus the fast money tied to hedge funds.\n\nSpeculative money is as short as it has been in a long time, but real money is putting cash to work, Goncalves said.\n\nGold\n\nGold has rallied sharply over the past three weeks in what MarketWatch's Mark DeCambre called one of the clearest signs that a rally inspired by President-elect Donald Trump is starting to stall.\n\nGold futures were trading at a six-week high near $1,200 an ounce on Thursday. Gold plunged in the aftermath of the election. Along with bonds, the shiny metal fell victim to the inflation tradeâ€”the notion that Trump's fiscal policies would cause inflation to accelerate in 2017.\n\nBecause it doesn't carry a yield, gold is considered a hedge against inflation, and typically outperforms when interest rates are low and prices of consumer goods are stagnant.\n\nThe dollar\n\nIncreasing interest-rate expectations, as well as Trump's promise to allow U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign earnings free of tax, have helped boost the dollar.\n\nTypically, rising interest rates, or the expectation thereof, cause a currency to appreciate by increasing the return on assets denominated in that currency, making it more attractive to foreign investors.\n\nRead:The dollar rally has about run its course, by these measures\n\nBut currency traders were disheartened when Trump provided scant details about his economic policy priorities at a press conference on Wednesdayâ€”and the dollar sold off accordingly.\n\nNow, does this mean the Trump trade in whole is dead? Not necessarily. But for now, at least, these trades are likely to stall until the inauguration, at the very least, market strategists said.\n\nPeople bought the hope. Not just the rumor, but the hope, said Greg Anderson, global head of currency strategy at BMO Capital Markets. I think they'll be right on the fact, but in the mean time, you're holding a position that is very vulnerable to periodic cleanouts.
Overstock OSTK, -2.29% will become the first company in the U.S. to pay its taxes in bitcoin.\n\nThe online retailer will take advantage of a program in Ohio, announced in November, to pay a portion of its taxes using the cryptocurrency. Overstock was an early adopter of bitcoin BTCUSD, -1.22% becoming one of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin for payment on its site in 2014.\n\nOverstock chief executive officer and founder Patrick M. Byrne said in a statement that thoughtful government adoption of emerging technologies when accompanied by non-restrictive legislation over these technologies is the best way forward for the U.S., and other advanced economies.\n\nThe plan may sound like a gimmick, but it could actually be a money-saver for businesses in the crypto space, said Neeraj Agrawal, director of communications at Washington, D.C.-based cryptocurrency policy think tank Coin Center.\n\nThis would be good idea for a business that already has a lot of bitcoin as it saves them the step of converting their bitcoin to dollars before paying taxes, he said. Now they will just be converted right at the moment of payment.\n\nThe same goes for people looking to pay their personal income taxes with cryptocurrency, which is not currently allowed in Ohio but will be eventually in the second phase of the program, Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel told Bitcoin magazine.\n\nIn Phase II, we hope to expand Ohiocrypto.com to include individual personal taxes, and also to expand beyond just bitcoin and include other cryptocurrencies as well, he said. We thought the most intuitive and responsible way to begin this initiative, because it's the first time it's ever been done in America, is to start it off right â€” and that is by only allowing businesses to pay with bitcoin, and expand it out from there.\n\n As with all cryptocurrency payments, the transaction will trigger capital gains taxes on the bitcoin used to pay taxes, so you'll have to pay taxes on your taxes. \n\nAs with all cryptocurrency payments, the transaction will trigger capital gains taxes on the bitcoin used to pay taxes. In other words, you'll have to pay taxes on your taxes.\n\nWhile this may sound like a headache, it can actually help people who have lost money in bitcoin's volatile year, said Farrukh Shaikh, chief financial officer and cofounder of Gath3r, a cryptocurrency mining service.\n\nIf the current bitcoin price is higher than the price you originally paid, then you would have to pay extra tax on the now realized gain from the bitcoin payment. However, if the current bitcoin price is lower than your basis price, then it amounts to realizing a loss on the bitcoin, which can be offset against your total tax bill and reduce it.\n\nUsing bitcoin to pay taxes may be attractive to people who are currently at a loss from their bitcoin entry price if they want to reduce their bitcoin holdings and pay taxes around the same time, he said.\n\n People must report whether each transaction was a loss or a gain, which can be difficult given the volatility of cryptocurrencies. \n\nBitcoin fell from highs of nearly $20,000 per coin in December 2017 to 10 consecutive sessions below $4,000 in late 2018.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service hasn't released a detailed policy on how to go about paying taxes using cryptocurrency, besides a ruling in 2014 stating that selling bitcoin is treated the same as selling property or any other capital asset. People must report each transaction in terms of whether it was a loss or a gain, which can be difficult given the volatility of cryptocurrencies.\n\nExperts suggest filing taxes with a Certified Public Accountant, particularly one with cryptocurrency expertise, if you have done business in bitcoin in the past year. Thus far, Ohio is the first and only state to accept bitcoin payments from businesses for taxes.\n\nMandel said the state wanted to show it is on the forefront of new technology by announcing the new tax policy by announcing Ohiocrypto.com.\n\nWe wanted to project to the rest of the country that Ohio is embracing technology and is a place that is welcoming software developers and entrepreneurs who want to build a blockchain business here in the state of Ohio, he said.
Oil prices started the week slightly lower Monday, pressured by a rising U.S. rig count, even as the price of crude continues to hover near record three-year highs.\n\nBrent crude UK:LCOH8 , the global benchmark, was down 0.2% at $69.73 a barrel, on London's Intercontinental Exchange. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures US:CLG8 were trading down 0.1%, at $64.24 a barrel.\n\nRead:Which markets are closed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nBaker Hughes said late Friday that the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. last week rose by 10 to 757. The U.S. oil rig count is generally viewed as a proxy for activity in the sector.\n\nI expect the rig count to continue to increase, as U.S. shale producers ramp up production, said Georgi Slavov, head of research at brokerage Marex Spectron.\n\nBut Slavov said prices have largely been supported in recent weeks by money managers' exceptional net long positions on the market and a dollar under pressure. Both Brent and WTI have posted gains for four straight weeks and prices have risen more than 50% since 2017 lows last June.\n\nThe ICE dollar Index DXY, -0.03% sank to a new three-year low Monday, driven by expectations of monetary-policy tightening. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-traded oil less expensive for foreign buyers, generally boosting prices.\n\nManaged money net long positions last week hit a record high of over 432,000 lots, according to consultancy JBC Energy.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, the surge in U.S. managed money raises a clear red flag for us, JBC analysts wrote in a note Monday.\n\nThe consultancy predicts the price of WTI falling over the next two months as a result of the rising U.S. production.\n\nBut even as U.S. shale oil production has been rising, the market has looked to more bullish factors in recent weeks. That includes perceived geopolitical threats to supply from the Middle East, declining petroleum inventories and strong compliance with an OPEC-led agreement to curb crude output.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 producers outside the cartel, including Russia, agreed late last year to extend an accord to hold back production by 2% through the end of this year. The agreement was first reached in late 2016 in an effort to rein in the global supply glut and boost prices that have languished since late 2014.\n\nInventories are coming down faster than we expected and OPEC is succeeding in rebalancing the oil market, analysts at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch wrote in a note Monday.\n\nAmong refined products, Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock US:RBG8 â€” the benchmark gasoline contract â€” was flat, $1.85 a gallon. February heating oil US:HOG8 was down 0.1% at $2.08 a gallon, while February natural gas US:NGG18 was down 1.7% to $3.15 per million British thermal units.
The U.S. dollar pared earlier losses on Tuesday in the second half of the trading day, as the euro gave up some of the gains it achieved on the back of strong economic growth data.\n\nWhat are currencies doing?\n\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.03% , which measures the buck against a basket of six rival currencies, gave up 0.1% to 89.215. The moderate selloff reversed Monday's recovery in which the index inched up 0.4% and partly retraced last week's drop that sent it to a three-year low.\n\nThe broader WSJ U.S. Dollar Index BUXX, +0.05% slipped 0.1% to 83.29.\n\nThe euro EURUSD, -0.03% rose to $1.2397, up from $1.2383 late Monday in New York, while the pound GBPUSD, -0.14% jumped to $1.4143 from $1.4075 on Monday. Sterling briefly slipped below the $1.40 handle earlier on Tuesday after a leaked U.K. government document projected that the U.K. would be significantly worse off outside the EU, regardless of what Brexit deal is struck.\n\nThe dollar also moved lower against the yen USDJPY, -0.01% , buying Â¥108.82 from Â¥108.96 on Monday.\n\nWhat is driving the market?\n\nTuesday's dollar pullback was seen as a reversal from Monday's rally, which came on the coattails of the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% surging to its highest level since April 2014. Yields retreated early in the session on Tuesday, weighing on the buck, but the U.S. currency remained low even as Treasurys resumed their ascend. The 10-year note last yielded 2.71%, according to FactSet.\n\nSee: These are the 2 biggest reasons for a weaker U.S. dollar\n\nDollar traders are also cautiously looking at Tuesday evening's presidential State of the Union address, as well as the conclusion Wednesday of a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting. No changes are expected from the Fed during the meeting, the last to be headed by Janet Yellen. She will be succeeded by Fed Gov. Jay Powell.\n\nRead:How the stock market has reacted to State of the Union speeches\n\nThe euro was also supported by Eurostat data showing the eurozone economy expanded by 2.7% in 2017, beating the FactSet consensus estimate of 2.6%, and further adding to evidence the region's recovery is in full swing.\n\nAlso read: Here's one thing that could ruin the 'euroboom'\n\nMeanwhile in the U.K., Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney testified in front of the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, and said U.K. inflation would remain above the central bank's 2% target.\n\nUpon being asked about the weaker dollar, Carney refrained from commenting directly, but said he appreciated President Donald Trump's comments last week. Trump last week said the dollar would get stronger and stronger in line with U.S. economic growth, remarks that came after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said a weaker currency helped U.S. exports.\n\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\nUpside movement for the dollar failed to sustain its momentum as the market has yet again turned sour on the greenback, said Lennon Sweeting, head of corporate trading and chief market strategist at HiFX, adding that he didn't expect big swings in the buck head of the State of the Union address.\n\nThe dollar is failing to find traction as traders refuse to get behind the buck without a clearer path to higher rates, he said.\n\nThe shape of the dollar's pullback will give better indication of whether or not the long overdue technical correction is at hand. A move above $1.2440-$1.2460 might see the euro re-challenge its recent highs above $1.25 and probe into the band of technical objectives that extends from around $1.26 to $1.28, added currency strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman said in a note.\n\nWhat does the data say?\n\nThe Case-Shiller home price index accelerated in November, rising a seasonally adjusted 6.4%, versus 6.2% before.\n\nConsumer confidence rose to 125.4 in January, beating the MarketWatch consensus estimate of 125, as well as the 122.1 level from December.\n\nHomeownership, meanwhile, jumped to 64.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 63.9% before.
The markets are a pretty strange brew right now, with investors not even sure where to look first, with so many different assets swirling around.\n\nIs hesitation starting to build over this stock market's gains? After a two-day run-up for stock futures, Wall Street only let everyone down by the end of Tuesday's session, the first of the week. That may lead to some sideways glances at some gains early on this morning. Fool me twice ...\n\nThen there's the dollar basket-case, bond volatility and finally, the Great-Scott-what-is-happening-here? selloff for cryptocurrencies, which may be getting a second wind this morning:\n\nOur call of the day suggests investors try not to engage in too much schadenfreude where bitcoin and its ilk are concerned, because there's a lesson here for stock traders.\n\nRemember the bitcoin optimism and certainty when it rose to $19,000 a couple of weeks ago? The price action at that time felt like it could never go down. Much like today's certainty regarding equity prices, writes Kevin Muir, blogging at Macro Tourist.\n\nMuir says the S&P 500 has most definitely hit the just-get-me-in stage of the rally. When the short-term top finally comes, investors should be ready because it likely won't correct by going sideways for a couple of weeks, he adds, citing one of Wall Street veteran Bob Farrell's investment rules.\n\nAnd when a correction does come, it might be more violent than most expect, Muir says, in separate comments â€” but note that he's not making a secular shift or calling for a new bear market. Fear? It's overblown, says this fund manager.\n\nRead:This is a blunt reminder about the randomness of investment performance\n\nWeighing in a bit more on that relationship between cryptocurrencies and stocks is Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Exchange. He says one of the inherent dangers with the global central bank response to the financial crisis is that it necessitated the implementation of an aggressive and unprecedented policy, encouraging excessive and reckless investment. \n\nAnd the euphoria driving up cryptocurrencies and meltup of global stocks are both direct products of an ongoing, near-decade long monetary-policy experiment, he suggests in emailed comments.\n\nWhat's fascinating, and perhaps ironic, is that crypto has benefited from central bank accommodation, despite being born out of a distrust and rejection of this very institution, Kruger says.\n\nLater, we'll get to hear from a clutch of Federal Reserve speakers â€” who have already fired a warning shot for markets.\n\nRead: Why ditching stocks in this bull market is a 'dangerous' move\n\nKey market gauges\n\nThe Dow DJIA, -0.46% , S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% and Nasdaq are all moving higher in early trading.

Here's the weekly chart he's watching right now:\n\nTrend Trading Signals\n\nIt has registered 4 weekly closes over the 40-week (200-day moving average), has been up 4 weeks in a row and is close to a cross of the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, but this has not happened just yet, he says in emailed comments. Moving averages are used to help gauge where prices are going.\n\nThe last time the 10-week crossed over the 40-week moving average was February of 2016, as the ETF tripled in value from $16 to just over $49, notes Tentarelli.\n\nHe adds that a weekly close below $32.70 for the ETF would negate that trade.\n\nThe buzz\n\nBank of America BAC, +2.61% is jumping despite a revenue miss, while Goldman Sachs GS, +0.88% is dipping after its first quarterly loss in 6 years.

The S&P 500 is down nearly 10% from its peak last May and the Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down about 19% from its peak last June, yet it might be premature to call this a buying opportunity, according to some analysts.\n\nThe American Association of Individual Investors, which conducts weekly surveys, said that bearish sentimentâ€”when investors think market will fall over the next 6-12 monthsâ€”rose to 38% last week and stayed above historical average of 30% in three of the past four weeks.\n\nFrom declining earnings to high valuations to multiyear record low oil prices, these analysts still see plenty of reasons for investors to remain pessimistic.\n\nEarnings and the economy\n\nEarning growth is expected to be negative for the fourth quarter, while major banks have downgraded 2016 full-year earnings estimates to show virtually no growth from last year's levels.\n\nNew Year's hangover for Wall Street: Earnings season misery\n\nThe U.S. economy continues to grow at two different speeds: The services sector remains strong, with decent job gains to back it. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector has been in contraction for the past year. While it is true that a growing economy is good for stocks, most of the profits on the S&P 500 come from the manufacturing sector.\n\nOne chart shows how U.S. businesses are falling flat\n\nConsumers and the services sector cannot offset declining manufacturing. Meanwhile, contrary to expectations, corporations will scale back buybacks, which have been propping up earnings per share so far, said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management LLC.\n\nNo PE expansion\n\nThe S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% saw double-digit gains from 2012 until 2014, primarily due to multiple (or price-to-earnings ratio) expansionâ€”when investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings. The major reason behind the P/E expansion in 2012-2014 was the pumping of extraordinary liquidity in the form of Federal Reserve bond-buying program.\n\nIn 2016, just like in 2015, not only there is no quantitative easing, but the Fed is on the path of normalizing interest rates, getting them off near-zero levels.\n\nOverall PEs are coming back down and things will get attractive, but it's only a good opportunity if you have patience, at least a 12-month horizon, said Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist at Voya Financial, adding that markets are likely to improve in the second half of this year.\n\nOpinion: Stocks still aren't even close to being cheap\n\nOil and Dollar\n\nOil prices fell 45% in 2014 and another 16% in 2015â€”on a combination of increasing production and oversupply, waning demand from China and a strengthening dollar. Over the first six trading session of the new year, crude prices fell another 15% to below $32 a barrel. Morgan Stanley joined other banks forecasting oil to fall to $20 a barrel as the dollar is likely to rise due to tighter monetary policy.\n\nFalling oil and stronger dollar will work as a double whammy for already weak corporate earnings. But predicting either of those is really difficult. Energy and materials companies may not have reached bottoms yet. See: One-third of U.S. oil companies could face bankruptcy.\n\nWe are not looking at any energy companies no matter how cheap we think they are, said Kim Forrest, portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital.\n\nChina and the rest of emerging markets\n\nWhile it is true there is historically little correlation between Chinese equities and U.S. stock markets, investors remain jittery.\n\nSharp falls and trading halts in Shanghai last week and confusion over China's policy intentions as it allowed the yuan to weaken did send shock waves through global financial markets. The events showed that nervousness over China and other emerging markets can serve as catalysts when nervous investors are looking for an excuse to sell.
Investors dismissing the recent climb in Treasury yields might want to heed Ray Dalio, founder of the largest hedge fund in the world.\n\n 'A 1% rise in bond yields will produce the largest bear market in bonds since the 1980-1981 period.' \n\nAdding to recent calls from fixed-income investing luminaries like Bill Gross, Dalio said bonds were in the midst of a bear market, in an interview with Bloomberg TV at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The hedge-fund maestro's comments follow a previous interview in which the founder of Bridgewater Associates said investors would rue holding cash as the stock market surged to new heights amid tepid inflation and solid economic growth.\n\nSee: Head of world's largest hedge fund says 'if you're holding cash, you're going to feel pretty stupid'\n\nMarketWatch Topics: World Economic Forum in Davos\n\nAsked what could upset benign economic conditions and the resulting party in risk assets, Dalio pointed the finger at tighter monetary policy. I think the Fed is going to tighten faster than they are really signaling, he said.\n\nResponsible for more than $150 billion in investor money, the hedge-fund manager showed concerns bond investors could be blindsided by an aggressive Federal Reserve willing to ratchet up interest rates as the economy kicks into higher gear.\n\nAssets themselves are more sensitive, a 1% rise in bond yields will produce the largest bear market in bonds since the 1980-1981 period, said Dalio. At the turn of the 1980s, a rare combination of high unemployment and inflation stalked the devastated U.S. economy, driving the 10-year yield to a record high of 15.68% in October 1981.\n\nSince the financial crisis a decade ago, bond yields across the world have slipped lower and lower as central banks launched asset-purchasing programs.\n\nIn response, investors have plowed into bonds with longer durations in search of richer returns. In early 2017, the duration of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the benchmark index for creditworthy debt, pushed past an all-time high.\n\nThe longer the duration, the more bond prices will fall in response to interest-rate increases. At the same time, issuers tend to offer higher yields to compensate investors for incurring so-called duration risk.\n\nIt isn't just Dalio warning about the explosive cocktail of longer-dated debt and tighter monetary policy. By the Office of Financial Research's own calculations, an increase of 1 percentage point in interest rates would lead the securities underlying the benchmark bond index to shed more than $1.2 trillion.\n\nRead: Risk of a big stock or bond market drop 'are high and rising, government watchdog says\n\nDalio said other risks to the bond market included an influx of Treasury issuance this year as the Fed reduces its portfolio of government securities.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Inflation is likely to move back to the U.S. central bank's 2% annual target in the near-term, said Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, on Thursday. After the price of oil bottoms out, I would expect to see headline inflation move significantly higher, Lacker said in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Raleigh, N.C. Most Fed officials, including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen have been more cautious, saying that inflation will move higher over a more loosely-defined medium term. Lacker is a hawk on the Fed's interest rate committee, having dissented at the Fed's September and October meetings in favor of an increase in interest rates. He is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year.
