LONDON (Project Syndicate) — One of the most extraordinary things about the current protests in Iran — the largest since the Green Movement in 2009 — is that the very people that they are directed against may well have been the people who started them. Iran's ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate President Hassan Rouhani.\n\nBut, if that is the case, they failed to anticipate the depth of the dissatisfaction of the Iranian people with the status quo — especially their own role in it.\n\nTo be clear, despite the massive scale of the protests, they are very unlikely to bring down the regime. Iran's security forces are too strong and have too much at stake in the current system, which gives them control of vast swaths of the Iranian economy.\n\n Iran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the Middle East. Amid the current protests, however, the West has a golden opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on domestic economic conditions. \n\nMoreover, the protesters are essentially leaderless and lack clear objectives. No matter how much encouragement Western powers give them, the protests seem all but certain to end with Islamist hardliners retaining their power bases and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps retaining control of most of the state's assets and security activities.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that nothing will change. Nor does it mean that the West has no leverage to exercise.\n\nIt is possible, for example, that Rouhani will end up stepping down, whether by force or choice.\n\nBut this would hardly count as success for the protesters. After all, Rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm. If protecting their government's religious purity — and their own ill-gotten gains — required brutally repressing their own people and returning Iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.\n\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman's Ambitious Plans for Saudi Arabia\n\nWhether Rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely — indeed, perhaps not for very much longer. Iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship. But, thanks partly to persistent corruption — Iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area — annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%. According to Gallup, only citizens of Iraq and South Sudan are more pessimistic about their future.\n\nSo far, Rouhani has been unwilling or unable to use the power of the presidency to reform Iran. But, amid the protests, he is more motivated than ever to improve domestic economic conditions. Should he fail, Iran may face a larger wave of protests, with stronger leadership and clearer objectives.\n\nAny effort to reform Iran's economy must recognize the costly absurdity of the country's expansionist foreign policies. Funding a proxy war in Yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in Lebanon, and seeking to dominate Syria and Iraq cost billions of dollars annually.\n\nIt should not have come as a surprise when protesters shouted, Let go of Syria; think about us.\n\nIranian citizens are not alone in taking issue with their country's foreign policy. Most Western and Middle Eastern governments are also highly concerned about Iran's behavior, which reflects a rejection of international norms such as respect for national sovereignty. Iran's public threats to destroy America and the Gulf states certainly don't help matters.\n\nIran's problematic foreign policy is the result not of mismanagement, but of toxic ideology. Indeed, two fixed notions underpin it.\n\nFirst, Iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (That commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between Russia and Iran.) Second — and more dangerous — Iran's leaders believe that they have a God-given right to unite Shia Muslims under a single caliphate. The result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.\n\nIran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the Middle East over the past decade, beachheads that regime hardliners regard as crucial national-security and foreign-policy assets.\n\nAmid the current protests, however, the West has an opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on its desperate domestic situation. If an agreement is reached, existing sanctions can be reduced; if Iran's leaders refuse to budge, new sanctions could be introduced.\n\nTo be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of Iran's government, appeals based on Iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. But if Rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back Iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. This would minimize the risk of severe violence in Iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.\n\nIran is at a turning point. The world must now send its regime a clear message: stop destabilizing the region and help your own people to prosper.\n\nThis article was published with permission of Project Syndicate — The Best Hope for the Iranian People
The minutes of the Federal Reserve' December meeting showed a willingness to delay further interest rate hikes given the volatility in financial markets and concern about global growth, according to minutes of that meeting released Wednesday.\n\nWith the backdrop of market turmoil and rising concerns about global growth many participants expressed the view that, especially in the environment of muted inflation pressures, the FOMC could afford to be patient about further policy firming, the minutes show.\n\nThey argued that weak inflation readings allowed th central bank some latitude to wait and see how the data developed in light of the rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty over the global economic outlook, the minutes show.\n\nA number of officials said the Fed should be mindful of the downside risks and the effects of past rate hikes before making any further changes to policy. Officials stressed policy was not on a pre-set course.\n\nThe minutes suggest a cautious approach to future monetary policy, said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in an interview on CNBC.\n\nThe minutes also dovetail with the remarks from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell late last week, who stressed the Fed would change policy swiftly if economic conditions warrant the change. Powell 's remarks calmed markets who viewed the chairman as too upbeat at his press conference after the December rate hike.\n\nRead: Powell signals he's flexible on interest rates\n\nThe minutes also show some talk of slowing down the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet. At the moment, the Fed is letting $50 billion of maturing securities run off the balance sheet each month.\n\nBut other Fed officials were against tapering the pace of the run-off, saying they were worried it would be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of monetary policy.\n\nA few Fed officials were also against a December interest rate increase, the minutes show, although the voting members of the FOMC decided to push ahead with an interest-rate hike.\n\nThough financial conditions had tightened and global growth had moderated, [voting] members generally anticipated that growth would remain above trend and the labor market would remain strong, the minutes said.\n\nThe voting members did say that they didn't see the need for many more interest-rate hikes.\n\nThe FOMC judged that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening would likely be appropriate, the minutes said.\n\nThe Fed has penciled in two rate hikes in 2019, down from three hikes projected in September.\n\nFinancial markets currently see no chance of a rate hike in 2019.\n\nWhile Fed officials remained optimistic about the outlook, contacts in a number of Fed districts were less upbeat, the minutes said.
The American Dream seems more attainable overseas.\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday reportedly used vulgar language to describe immigrants from Haiti and African countries and said the U.S. needed more immigrants from countries like Norway. On Friday, Trump denied using the word shithole countries, but said he used tough language. The president's reported comments were described as racist by Rupert Colville, the United Nations spokesman for human rights. Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-denies-questioning-migration-from-shithole-countries-1515766158\n\nDon't miss:Less than half of Americans say they're middle class\n\n Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years. \n\nIn fact, Norway ranked No. 1 for happiness and personal freedom, according to an analysis of three separate studies on life expectancy by the World Bank, on civil liberties from Freedom House, a New York-based nonprofit that conducts research on advocacy and democracy, on happiness from the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), a group linked to the United Nations, and on rule of law from the World Justice Project, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.\n\nThe analysis was released by information-analytics firm LexisNexis Legal & Professional, a RELX Group RELX, -0.16% company, found that countries that have established a strong rule of law have significantly more success in securing measures of life, liberty and happiness for their citizens. Sweden ranked No. 2 and Canada was No. 3, followed by Australia, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria. The U.S. ranked No. 19 just behind the Czech Republic, Japan and France. Afghanistan ranked last at No. 98.\n\nNorway ranked No. 1 for happiness, the U.S. was No. 14\n\nNorway was also No. 1 out of 155 countries on the 2017 World Happiness Report, up from No. 4 the year before, followed by Denmark (last year's No. 1), Iceland and Switzerland. The U.S. was trailing at No. 14. These four countries rank highly on all the main factors found to support happiness: caring, freedom, generosity, honesty, health, income and good governance. Their averages are so close that small changes can re-order the rankings from year to year, the report said.\n\n 'Norway maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By producing its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future.' \n\nThe World Happiness Report was released in March 2017 and involved polling of 1,000 residents per country by research organization Gallup, and was put together by SDSN, a group linked to the United Nations and led in part by economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, known for The End of Poverty and other books. Where necessary, Gallup seeks the permissions of national, regional, and local governments. The interviews are conducted by phone and face-to-face.\n\nNorway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. It is sometimes said that Norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, Norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.\n\nU.S. has fallen on happiness list among OECD countries\n\nThe U.S. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. In 2007, it ranked No. 3 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. But it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. The predominant political discourse in the United States is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. But the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist Jeffrey Sachs wrote in the report.\n\n The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business. \n\nExperts say the divisive political climate in the U.S. likely hasn't helped. The United States can and should raise happiness by addressing America's multi-faceted social crisis — rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust — rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth, especially since the concrete proposals along these lines would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the deepening social crisis, the report added.\n\nThe U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. America's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… Almost all of the policy discourse in Washington, D.C. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in American society. This kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.\n\nKeeping a Millennial Staff Happy, and More\n\nU.S. criticized for inequality and cuts in welfare\n\nPresident Trump's latest remarks about immigrants follows criticisms last month made by Professor Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, about growing inequality in the U.S. He released a report heaping scorn on what he described as the Trump administration's dramatic change of direction in U.S. policies relating to inequality and extreme poverty. He cited the administration's current tax proposals and dramatic cuts in welfare.\n\n UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, criticized the 'dramatic change of direction in U.S. policies relating to inequality.' \n\nAlston spent two weeks traveling through California, Alabama, Georgia, Puerto Rico, West Virginia, and Washington D.C. and spoke with dozens of experts and civil society groups, met with senior state and federal government officials and talked with many people who are homeless or living in deep poverty. Contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound, Alston said.\n\nEarlier this week, a separate report examined mortality for the U.S. and other wealthy nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for children from birth to age 19 from 1961 to 2010. From 2001 to 2010 the risk of death in the U.S. was 76% greater for infants and 57% greater for children ages 1 to 19, according to the study, Child Mortality In The US And 19 OECD Comparator Nations: A 50-Year Time-Trend Analysis, published in Health Affairs journal.\n\n(This story was republished.)
Gold prices gave up earlier lows on Wednesday to end higher for a fifth session, then eased back in electronic trading from their settlement shortly after the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book. The report, which offers a snapshot of domestic economic activity, said the pace of growth continues to be modest to moderate. The report comes ahead of the Fed's next monetary policy meeting, during which the central bank is expected to keep short-term interest rates steady. February gold gcg8 was at $1,338.30 an ounce in electronic trading. Prices had gained $2.10, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,339.20 an ounce for the session, their highest since Sept. 8, according to FactSet data.
Gold prices bounced back from earlier losses on Friday to finish modestly higher. The precious metal stretched its streak of gains to an eleventh session and tallied a weekly gain of roughly 1% as some downbeat U.S. economic data helped feed expectations for a slower Federal Reserve interest-rate hike policy. February gold gcg8 rose 70 cents, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,322.30 an ounce, marking another finish at the highest level since mid-September. The weekly gain was also gold's fourth such rise in a row.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Tuesday unveiled a fresh £4.6 billion ($6.2 billion) support package for struggling U.K. businesses, just hours after the government imposed a third lockdown in the country to curb a rapid rise in coronavirus cases.\n\nBusinesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be able to claim up to £9,000 ($12,235) in one-off grants to help them cope with the latest restrictions, which were announced late on Monday night by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\n\nUnder the new lockdown, all hospitality venues and nonessential shops must remain closed until at least mid February, heaping more pressure on those already-struggling sectors.\n\nThe new lockdown grants are expected to benefit more than 600,000 business properties across the U.K., and will be worth around £4 billion, the treasury said. A further £594 million will be made available to local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants.\n\nRead: Third national lockdown confirmed as new variant spreads across England\n\nThe new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge — and whilst the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further, Sunak said in a statement. This [support package] will help businesses to get through the months ahead — and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen, he added.\n\nThe new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.\n\nSunak said in November that government support measures to that date to help businesses cope with the COVID-19 pandemic would cost about £280 billion this financial year.\n\nNews of the cash injection lifted shares in pub groups Marston's MARS, -2.23% and Mitchells & Butlers MAB, -2.87% , which rose 2.39% and 2.43% respectively in London trading on Tuesday morning. Restaurant Group RTN, -1.50% , which operates 350 restaurants and pubs across the U.K. including the Frankie & Benny's and Wagamama chains, saw its stock rise 3.69%.\n\nRead: European markets slide as new lockdown measures set to take effect in the U.K. and Germany\n\nBusiness leaders welcomed the support package, but warned that on its own, the support wasn't enough to keep businesses afloat longer term.\n\n This is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills  — Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality\n\nWhile this announcement is most welcome, make no mistake that this is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills — it is not enough to even cover the costs of many businesses and certainly will not underpin longer-term business viability for our sector, said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality.\n\nTo address the inevitable and existential challenges that hospitality faces, we need confirmation of extensions to the business rates holiday and of the 5% VAT [value-added tax] rate, she added.\n\nThe U.K.'s hospitality sector suffered lost sales of more than £53 billion ($72 billion) in 2020 due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions on trade, according to a data report by CGA and UKHospitality published in December.\n\nAdam Marshall, director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said on Twitter TWTR, +1.37% that ministers need to set out a clear support package for the whole of 2021 — not just until spring — to help businesses of all shapes and sizes survive this difficult and uncertain year.\n\nRoger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said the new cash injection would go some way to reassuring the worst affected businesses, but warned that the chancellor must remain wary of a spring cliff-edge in business support as the furlough program and other support measures unwind.\n\nRead: Europe hopes next COVID stimulus will be the last
Good news for payday lenders and the mortgage industry. Bad news for consumers.\n\nThe temporary head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has announced a new plan for the agency that seems to confirm the fears of consumer advocates.\n\nWe have committed to fulfill the bureau's statutory responsibilities, but go no further, he said in the new five-year strategic plan he unveiled Monday. He said it should serve as a bulwark against the misuse of our unparalleled powers. Mulvaney, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and other Republicans have frequently said the CFPB is too powerful.\n\nThe CFPB was created by the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. It will continue to adhere to its mission as laid out by Dodd-Frank, Mulvaney said: It will regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products or services under the Federal consumer financial laws and educate and empower consumers to make better informed financial decisions.\n\nBut consumer advocates have worried since Mulvaney was appointed by President Donald Trump to take over the bureau that as director, he would favor companies over consumers. During its near seven-year history, the CFPB has taken on everything from the prepaid card industry to the mortgage servicing industry. (Richard Cordray, the previous head of the CFPB, was appointed during the Barack Obama administration.)\n\nThe latest plan shows Mulvaney is clearly working from the outside and the inside to destroy the CFPB and cripple its ability to protect consumers from financial predators, said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.\n\nLatest evidence that the CFPB is losing its teeth\n\nMulvaney wrote in an op-ed published in January The Wall Street Journal that the bureau will no longer push the envelope. When it comes to enforcement, we will focus on quantifiable and unavoidable harm to the consumer, he wrote. If we find that it exists, you can count on us to pursue the appropriate remedies vigorously. If it doesn't, we won't go looking for excuses to bring lawsuits.\n\nMulvaney wrote that the bureau previously believed we were the good guys and the financial-service industry was the bad guys, but that will change, he said.\n\nA database with hundreds of thousands of complaints is at risk\n\nConsumer advocates are also concerned that the CFPB will get rid of the database of complaints related to current investigations, which allows the public to air complaints publicly. It also provided a direct way for the public to engage with the CFPB's activities.\n\nThe database contains hundreds of thousands of complaints filed by consumers about issues ranging from predatory debt collectors to errors on credit reports. Republicans have argued that the database shouldn't be public, while consumer advocates say the public list of complaints is an important tool for consumers.\n\nA public database has been a powerful mechanism for keeping financial predators accountable to consumers, Melissa Stegman, senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit based in Durham, N.C., told MarketWatch. Pulling the complaints behind a cloak of secrecy would help let unscrupulous companies get away with mistreating consumers.\n\nPayday lenders targeting vulnerable borrowers may regain more power\n\nMulvaney announced in January the CFPB may reconsider a rule Cordray implemented for payday lenders that was designed to protect consumers and limit the amount lenders are allowed to loan them, if they do not meet certain borrowing criteria.\n\nDennis Shaul, the CEO of the Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group that includes payday lenders, said he was pleased. The bureau's rule was crafted on a pre-determined, partisan agenda that failed to demonstrate consumer harm from small-dollar loans, ignored unbiased research and data, and relied on flawed information to support its rulemaking, he said.\n\nBut that's not good news for consumers, especially low-income households who often turn to payday lenders who have charged interest rates of up to 400%, Frisch said. There is no reason to delay implementation of this rule — unless you are more concerned with the needs of payday lenders than you are with the interests of the consumers these financial bottom-feeders prey upon, he told MarketWatch.\n\nStill, the CFPB's payday lending rules were complex, amounting to more than 1,000 pages, said Nick Clements, the co-founder of personal finance company MagnifyMoney, who previously worked in the credit industry. Although payday lenders can indeed cause borrowers financial distress, I do think there are some fair criticisms of the CFPB in terms of excessive complexity, he said.\n\nMulvaney requested zero dollars for his second-quarter budget\n\nIn January, Mulvaney requested zero dollars in his second-quarter budget request and said the agency has enough money for now.\n\nThe bureau already had $177 million in reserves, enough to cover the $145 million the bureau projected it would need during the second quarter, he said. I see no practical reason for such a large reserve, Mulvaney wrote in his funds request to the Federal Reserve, since I am informed that the board has never denied a bureau request for funding and has always delivered requested funds in a timely fashion.\n\nBut that request, some argue, could be a sign that the bureau is preparing to slow down. This is the latest chapter in Mulvaney's long campaign to undermine and completely dismantle the consumer bureau, wrote Debbie Goldstein, the executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit based in Durham, N.C. She said requesting zero dollars sent the message that its work of defending consumers is not worth a penny.\n\nMulvaney and Cordray trade insults over the CFPB's future\n\nCordray struck back against Mulvaney in January, saying on Twitter that the op-ed shows more retreat … from current squatter leadership.\n\nThe fish rots from the head down, he wrote.\n\nMulvaney's op-ed and recent statements have alarmed some consumer advocates. I don't think anybody in their right mind would say they believe consumers need less protecting, and who really needs help is banks, predators and financial bad actors, said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.\n\nThe new leadership has taken over at a time when consumers are struggling with credit-card, auto loan and student loan debt.\n\nWhat has the CFPB actually done for you?\n\nIn January 2017, the CFPB sued Navient Corp., the largest servicer of federal and private student loans in the U.S., in connection with creating obstacles for borrowers to repay their debts. The attorneys general of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington have also sued Navient. (A spokeswoman for Navient said the cases are still pending and said no ruling has been made on the facts in any of those three states. She pointed to a lengthy company statement on the cases, which say that the allegations were unfounded.)\n\nThe agency fined Wells Fargo WFC, +2.43% $100 million in September 2016 for alleged illegal practices including opening as many as two million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' knowledge. (Wells Fargo did not confirm or deny the charges but agreed to pay the fine and later fired more than 5,000 employees because of improper sales practices.) At the time, Republicans said the CFPB acted slowly on the Wells Fargo case.\n\nStruggling to pay student debt? Here's what you need to know.\n\nWhy should you care about the change in direction?\n\nIn the few months since his November 2017 appointment, Mulvaney has already reversed some key actions taken by his predecessor, and yet many Americans may not have noticed. At least, not yet.\n\nThe CFPB has had some major wins against the financial services industry in recent years, but a majority of Americans appear to be unaware. More than 80% of people said they did not know enough about the CFPB to form an opinion of it, in a 2017 survey by the credit-card website CreditCards.com. (Since then, more people likely know about the CFPB because of recent controversies, Frisch said.)\n\nBut those same people indicated they would in theory support an agency like the CFPB, if they knew it existed. Some 80% of respondents in the CreditCards.com survey said they were in favor of having a federal government agency whose goal is to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and take action against companies who break the law. The irony? That description CreditCards.com took from the CFPB's mission statement, without naming the agency.\n\nUnder Trump, the CFPB wants to cut down on corporate red tape\n\nThe CFPB regarded as an unencumbered rulemaking and rule writing, Clements said. I think you'll see less, not more from the CFPB going forward.\n\nThe logic: If companies are burdened by expensive investigations, they may have to pass their costs onto consumers through their products, said Joe Jacquot, a partner at the law firm Foley & Lardner, based in Jacksonville, Fla.\n\nSpecifically, Mulvaney may look closely at the definition of abusive and specify how the bureau and attorneys general should regulate companies, said Nick Gess, a principal at Morgan Lewis, a law firm based in Washington, D.C. Despite what some argue, most institutions want to comply with the law.\n\nCurrently, the CFPB can issue a civil investigative demand when it needs to gather information, but that investigative process can be costly for companies, Jacquot said. State attorneys general can also enforce those laws, which can create costly investigations in their home states.
What is a microloan, and is one right for your small business?\n\nIf you're a small-business owner on a quest for capital, there are several smart reasons to turn to nonprofit microlenders. These lenders go beyond making small loans to entrepreneurs and provide some benefits that traditional lenders don't:\n\nProfit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans from government or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helping entrepreneurs in developing nations.\n\nMicrolenders typically offer loans of $50,000 or less to startups and other small-scale operations. Some make bigger loans to more established businesses.\n\nMany microlenders and nonprofits provide pro bono consulting and training, including helping small businesses build credit.\n\nGood options for nonprofit financing\n\nBelow, we list 13 sources for nonprofit financing. They include the top lenders based on information from two major small-business institutions, the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Aspen Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and educational research nonprofit.\n\nWhen considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions.\n\nNonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender.\n\nYou see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost, he says. But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn't a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, 'We're here.…We're more affordable.' \n\nTop U.S. microlenders\n\nThe Aspen Institute's FIELD program runs the U.S. Microenterprise Census, which collects data from microlenders across the country. Here are the top five microlenders by total loan amount disbursed, according to the program's 2014 survey, the most recent data available.\n\nGrameen America\n\nGrameen America is affiliated with the Grameen Foundation, an international organization known for programs that help poor communities address their own needs. Grameen America has disbursed more than $490 million in loans to tens of thousands of women in the U.S. The organization has a nontraditional lending system: Borrowers must form a group with four other women they trust. That group then participates in a week of financial training, at the end of which each member opens a savings account and receives a $1,500 microloan to build a small business.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $100.7 million\n\nLiftFund\n\nSan Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. The microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit and more likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. LiftFund got a boost in October 2016 when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced almost $5 million in funding for its new small-business loan program in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $18.7 million\n\nOpportunity Fund\n\nCalifornia-based Opportunity Fund has been serving residents of the state since 1994, with more than $160 million in microloans. Its borrowers have a median household income of $31,000 a year. Around 90% are minority-owned businesses, and about 30% are women-owned businesses. Opportunity Fund also provides financial literacy education to business owners.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $17.7 million\n\nAccion New Mexico\n\nAccion New Mexico offers small-business loans from $1,000 to $1 million in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Texas. The nonprofit also provides business counseling and marketing support and sponsors educational events. It's part of the Accion U.S. Network, which also has major chapters in New York, Chicago and San Diego. The international Accion nonprofit offers financing services and assistance, including microloans, in 32 countries.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $8.9 million\n\nJustine Petersen\n\nJustine Petersen, which is based in St. Louis, offers small-business loans, typically of less than $10,000. The nonprofit also finances businesses in rural areas through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Intermediary Relending Program and originates loans of up to $150,000 as part of the SBA's Community Advantage Program.\n\nMicroloans disbursed in 2014: $8.4 million\n\nTop SBA nonprofit lenders\n\nAside from its signature 7(a) term loans, the SBA issues low-cost small-business financing through a network of nonprofits.\n\nThe SBA Microloan Program offers loans of up to $50,000 administered through community-based nonprofit groups. The SBA Community Advantage Program offers loans of up to $250,000 in communities that historically have had limited access to capital. The federal agency guarantees up to 85% of Community Advantage financing.\n\nHere are the top five nonprofits in the SBA programs based on total loan amount disbursed to small businesses in 2015, the most recent data available:\n\nCDC Small Business Finance Corp.\n\nCDC Small Business Finance Corp. offers different types of financing for new and expanding businesses in California, Arizona and Nevada, including SBA Community Advantage loans of between $20,000 and $250,000.

In his State of the Union address, President Trump said there has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. But the new 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its accompanying report says that isn't so for low-income Americans.\n\nThe system is, by just about all measures, stacked against those with low incomes and low wealth for the benefit of the wealthiest, says the report from the nonpartisan but left-leaning Prosperity Now nonprofit, which provides research and recommendations regarding Americans with limited incomes.\n\nOne example: low-income people are ineligible for federal programs such as SNAP (food stamps) and TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) if they amass even modest savings, the report noted. Prosperity Now calls policies like this a roadblock on the path to saving.\n\nWhat the 2018 Prosperity Now scorecard found\n\nThe 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its report, Whose Bad Choices? How Policy Precludes Prosperity and What We Can Do About It, also make the argument that the U.S. economic system and policies of the Trump administration and Congress are stacked against people of color.\n\nWe've heard more rhetoric lately about [low-income] people making 'bad choices' or being 'irresponsible with money' and that's been the direction policy has been going,' said Kasey Wiedrich, director of applied research at Prosperity Now. We wanted to attack that. One example of the rhetoric: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) recently said lower-income Americans are just spending every darn penny they have whether it's on booze or women or movies.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley. Getty\n\nIn reality, however, the Prosperity Now report said, the dominant narrative about low-wealth people is nothing but a series of myths. Poor choices, the analysts there say, aren't why people are poor.\n\nRead: Booze, women or movies? What taxpayers are really spending their money on...\n\nThe 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard reviewed 115 outcome and policy measures for all 50 states and the District of Columbia to see how well residents are faring in five categories, and how much progress each state has made in adopting policies in them toward building a path to prosperity for all its residents. The categories: financial assets and income; businesses and jobs; homeownership and housing; health care and education.\n\nBest and worst states in the scorecard\n\nThe top five states, starting with the best: Vermont, New Hampshire, Hawaii, Minnesota and Utah. The bottom states, starting with the worst: Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Nevada and New Mexico and Alabama, which tied.\n\nWiedrich said the states with the lowest Scorecard rankings typically have the highest rates of low-wage jobs, lower credit scores and households struggling with incomes. Also, she added, these states tend to have less of a safety net. As a result, a financial emergency may hit their residents harder.\n\nLow-wage jobs are a chief reason so many low-income Americans have trouble making ends meet these days, according to Wiedrich.\n\nThis year's Scorecard found that nearly one in four jobs are in low-wage occupations — ones that don't pay enough to keep families above the federal poverty line. And, Prosperity Now's researchers say, even though unemployment has been cut in half since its peak in 2010 (from 9.6% to 4.5%), the rate of low-wage jobs has decreased by just two percentage points since 2013 (to 25.6%) and is still higher than in 2010 (when the rate was 21.5%).\n\nWeidrich concedes that there's been an incremental improvement in a lot of economic measures compared to a year ago. In addition to the falling unemployment rate (just 3% for people 55+), there are the rising stock market (until the past few days), increasing wages — up 2.9% in the past year — rising median net worth and a drop in the number of Americans without health insurance (something which may change with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate).\n\nWhat to do in your 40s to retire a millionaire\n\nSome economic improvements, but 'not a panacea for all'\n\nBut, Wiedrich is quick to add, it's still not a panacea for all.\n\nAlthough the median net worth has been rising more for people of color than for whites, the unemployment rate is still more than twice as high for blacks (7.7%) than for whites (3.5%).\n\nAnd roughly half of renters (46% of white renters and 54% of renters of color) are what Prosperity Now calls cost-burdened — they spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. That lowers their ability to save to buy a home, said Wiedrich. The homeownership figure in America has not really moved.\n\nDon't miss: Many older Americans are living a desperate, nomadic life\n\nProsperity Now argues that the 2017 tax law and a wave of deregulation by the Trump administration and Congress are helping the wealthiest Americans and corporations far more than people with low incomes.\n\nThe group's report cites a Tax Policy Center estimate that the new tax law will translate to a $51,140 tax cut for the wealthiest 1% of households, but families earning less than $25,000 in 2018 will see a mere $60 in tax savings. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) just took heat for tweeting about a Pennsylvania high-school secretary who was pleasantly surprised her paycheck rose $1.50 a week due to the tax cut.\n\nWhat the Prosperity Now report doesn't mention, however, is that the new tax law also doubled the standard deduction (to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly) and doubled the child-care tax credit (to as much as $2,000 per qualifying child). Both changes stand to help low-income Americans.\n\nWhat the debt figures say\n\nFor the first time, this year's Prosperity Now Scorecard included data on Americans' levels of personal debt and their debt management. Both have been improving, overall — but there are a few debt trends going in the wrong direction.\n\nOn the plus side, median credit card debt fell 6.5% from $2,397 in the second quarter of 2010 to $2,241 in the second quarter of 2017, adjusted for inflation. And the percentage of consumers with delinquent credit card debt decreased from 11.7% of borrowers in 2010 to 8.4% in 2017.\n\nBut student loan debt is a growing problem: Median student loan debt increased by 21.4% between 2010 and 2017, from $14,588 to $17,711. The percentage of student loan borrowers who are delinquent (15.8%) is nearly twice the percentage of delinquent credit card borrowers. Among those over 55 with student loan debt, 12.3% are severely delinquent.\n\nAlso, the report noted, many households of color are dealing with debt issues. Student loan debt typically haunts students of color for much longer than other students, it said. Households of color are also more likely to be turned down for loans and are more vulnerable to fees and predatory products than white households.\n\nAn Urban Institute study of 60 U.S. cities discovered that the predominately white areas had a median credit score 80 points higher than in predominately non-white neighborhoods, which can cost families of color $100 or more each month on a mortgage. And the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances found that African-American households are twice as likely as white household to be late on credit payments.\n\nAll in all, Wiedrich said, Americans with low wealth generally aren't reaping the benefits of today's humming economy. Their wages aren't keeping up with the rising costs of housing and health care. Also, many are dealing with income volatility, which makes it hard to plan and to make ends meet, said Wiedrich.\n\nStates expanding the earned income tax credit\n\nA few states, however, have recently adopted policies — or are working to do so — that could help low-income people on the path to prosperity.\n\nFor example, Hawaii, Montana and South Carolina established state earned income tax credits; California and Illinois expanded their credits to cover more working families. These tax credits, like the federal anti-poverty one, put money in the pockets of low- and moderate-income working people so they can keep more of what they earn. Currently, 29 states have a state earned income tax credit.\n\nHelping Americans save for retirement\n\nAnd, although the Trump administration and Congress recently made it tougher for states to set up retirement plans for residents whose employers don't offer them — a short-sighted policy, Weidrich said — a few states are creating them anyway.\n\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon have done this; Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington, the Prosperity Now report said, are pursuing similar strategies. That could be especially helpful for low-income people; 77% of the lowest-earning workers lack access to an employer-provided retirement plan.\n\n'Lifting citizens to prosperity'\n\nPresident Trump declared in his State of the Union speech that we can lift our citizens… from poverty to prosperity. But, Prosperity Now maintains, to make that happen, more states and federal policymakers need to do more — especially now, when times are good for so many.\n\nSee: Got $1 million to retire? Here's how long it will last in every U.S. state\n\nAt some point, the economy will encounter another downswing or recession and those who are not benefiting much from today's economic gains will be hardest hit, said Wiedrich.
International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.62% said Tuesday that it has appointed Gary Cohn to serve as vice chairman of its board of directors. Cohn will also join the company's executive leadership team. Cohn served as assistant for economic policy to President Donald Trump and director of the National Economic Council from January 2017 to April 2018. He previously worked as the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.95% . In a release, Cohn cheered IBM's focused growth strategy that will capitalize on the enormous opportunity in hybrid cloud and AI. IBM shares are up 0.7% in Tuesday morning trading. They've gained 3.1% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% has risen 9.7%.
With a Trump presidency rapidly bearing down on Wall Street, market participants are scrambling to get in position for at least the next four years. David Einhorn is prepared for a few scenarios including the possibility of a recession.\n\nIn a letter to clients dated Jan. 17, Einhorn, the founder of Greenlight Capital, offered up a few insights into his thinking as Donald Trump is set to be sworn in as the U.S.'s 45th president on Friday.
Federal Reserve officials saw the possibility that they might have to raise interest rates faster than the gradual pace that they have stressed for some time, according to minutes of the December meeting released Wednesday.\n\nThe account of the meeting suggest the era of a predictable and boring U.S. central bank may be over.\n\nBy a unanimous vote on Dec. 14, the Fed raised its federal-funds range by a quarter-percentage point to 0.50%-0.75%, its second rate increase in a decade. At the same time, Fed officials said economic conditions will warrant only gradual increases in the federal-funds rate. In the so-called dot plot, Fed officials penciled in three quarter-point rate increases in 2017 instead of two seen in September.\n\nMinutes of the meeting show many Fed officials thought this gradual policy path was under threat.\n\nFed officials pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different path of policy than the currently expected, the minutes said.\n\nU.S. stocks saw little reaction to the latest Fed minutes, after the Dow Jones Industrial DJIA, -0.46% closed Tuesday with a nearly 27% advance from its February lows.\n\nThe biggest risk was that the unemployment rate might drop sharply below the 4.5% jobless rate viewed as the longer-run normal level below which might spark inflation.\n\nThe unemployment rate is almost at that level having dropped to 4.6% in November.\n\nMany Fed officials judged the risk of a sizable undershooting of the normal jobless rate had increased somewhat and that the Federal Open Market Committee might need to raise the federal-funds rate more quickly than currently anticipated to limit the degree of undershooting and stem a potential buildup of inflationary pressures, according to the minutes.\n\nSome Fed officials saw this as a modest risk and said that a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate might help return inflation to the Fed's 2% target. But this seemed to be a minority view.\n\nSeveral Fed voting members noted that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than expected, it might become necessary to adjust the FOMC's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate, consistent with the possibility that a less gradual pace of increases could become appropriate, the minutes said.\n\nA couple of officials wanted to do away with the Fed's gradual rate hike pledge altogether.\n\nSeveral Fed officials noted that a faster pace of rate increases could also have implications for the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.\n\nChairwoman Janet Yellen has said the Fed would hold the balance sheet steady by reinvesting proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from mortgage-backed securities until the process of normalization of the federal funds rate is well underway.\n\nIt was too early to know what President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy might entail, and how this might alter the economic outlook, Fed members said.\n\nAlmost all Fed officials indicated that upside risks to their growth forecasts had increased as a result of prospects for more expansionary fiscal policies in coming years.\n\nAll in all, many participants emphasized that the greater uncertainties about these policies made it more challenging to communicate to the public about the likely path of the federal funds rate, the minutes said.
Congressional Democrats on Wednesday introduced legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nThe bill was introduced at a press conference with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who may seek the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nThe middle class is the backbone of our country, and the middle class and those who aspire to it are those we are here to work for, Pelosi said.\n\nWe are living today in an American economy which is doing very well for the people on top, not so well for working families, Sanders said.\n\nThe federal minimum wage has been at $7.25 since July 2009. The Raise the Wage Act would only gradually lift that wage, reaching $15 per hour by 2024. It would then index future minimum wage increases to median wage growth. It would also phase out subminimum wages for tipped, youth and disabled workers.\n\nThe bill was introduced with 181 House cosponsors and 31 Senate cosponsors. It is highly unlikely to become law under a Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nMany states have already been lifting their minimum wages above the federal minimum. Some 5.3 million workers started receiving higher pay starting Jan. 1, according to an analysis released by the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.\n\nIn 2017, over a half-million workers received the federal minimum wage, and another 1.8 million workers made below that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Treasurys weakened Friday, pushing the two-year yield above 2%, after a larger-than-expected rise in a key consumer-price measure underlined rising inflation expectations and dampened appetite for U.S. government paper.\n\nWhat did Treasurys do?\n\nThe yield on the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , sensitive to changes in monetary policy expectations, rose 2.9 basis points to 2.001%, its highest finish since September. 2008. That contributed to a 4.1 basis point climb this week.\n\nThe yield for the 10-year benchmark note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% rose 2 basis points to 2.551%, extending a 7.5 basis point weeklong rise. While, the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% slipped 0.9 basis point to 2.855%, but saw a 4.3 basis points rise for the week.
While the partial government shutdown is largely bad news for U.S. companies, payday lenders look set for a boost.\n\nWe're now getting to the point where federal employees are going to need some kind of short-term loan in some cases, said federal budget expert Stan Collender.\n\nIn cases where these employees can't turn to family or friends, companies that provide payday loans are going to benefit a little bit, because there's going to be a request for funds, said Collender, known for his Budget Guy blog.\n\nAbout 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without wages thanks to the shutdown, now in its 21th day. They are missing out on paychecks for the first time on Friday, which otherwise generally would have been payday.\n\nRelated:More banks are trying to get a piece of the payday loan pie\n\nAnd see:Four in 10 can't cover an emergency expense of $400, Fed survey finds\n\nBeyond conventional payday lenders, some credit unions that serve government employees are offering loans to affected workers during the shutdown, and they're not necessarily charging the high interest that's usually associated with cash advances. The Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering to lend up to $6,000 to eligible members, saying there will be no fees or interest charges, while the Congressional Federal Credit Union will extend a line of credit with a 0% interest rate for 60 days.\n\nSuch offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown Americans often have low levels of savings. Big banks including Wells Fargo WFC, -0.88% and Bank of America BAC, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a New York Times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. Pro baseball is getting involved, as the Washington Nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.\n\nThe payday lending industry's trade group, the Community Financial Services Association of America, didn't respond to requests for comment. Lenders World Acceptance Corp. WRLD, +1.06% and Enova International Inc. ENVA, -8.25% also didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt's possible that tax-preparation companies could see more demand for refund-advance loans, Collender said. The shutdown has threatened to delay the actual refunds, though the Trump administration said Monday that they would go out as usual.\n\nRead more:3 ways to protect your finances if you're a federal employee not getting paid\n\nFor the most part, the shutdown is a drag on big and small companies, according to Collender. He said: You see mostly losers here. Coffee shops, taxi businesses and other companies that serve government employees could be cutting their staffing, and small firms that provide things like office supplies are losing business and not likely to recoup it, the budget expert said.\n\nThere is incredible uncertainty relating to the TSA, and as that relates to air travel and tourism, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research and Trading, referring to reports of longer lines at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints as agents who aren't getting paid call out sick. (In the wake of such reports, the TSA said 90% of U.S. passengers waited less than 15 minutes on Sunday, while a big pilots union has called for an end to the shutdown because it's hurting safety and efficiency.)\n\nSome airlines have voiced concerns about delays in the certification of new aircraft and slowdowns in the training of pilots and air traffic controllers, said Clayton Allen, a Height Capital Markets analyst.\n\nOne of the things that is maybe not appreciable now, but will have an impact as time goes on, is the impact on air traffic control, he told MarketWatch. We have a shortage of air traffic controllers, so slowing down the training process today means that a year from now, six month from now, you're not going to have as many air traffic controllers as you thought you would.\n\nThe aviation industry is hurt in particular because two key government entities that it must deal with are affected by the shutdown — the Homeland Security Department and the Federal Aviation Administration, Allen added.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is also hit by the government closure, the Height analyst noted.\n\nThat's not really a positive for financial markets SPX, -0.16% , because not having a regulator in your office doesn't mean you can run hog wild. It just means you can't get sign-off on things, Allen said. I kind of struggle to find people who are winning in this scenario, from a corporate perspective.\n\nThe shutdown is disrupting the initial-public-offering process and may cause delays in some of the bigger IPOs expected in 2019. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies for big business in Washington, has called for an end to the closure, saying it's hearing every day from businesses across the country about how the adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.\n\nThe ongoing shutdown has been sparked by a dispute over money for President Donald Trump's proposed wall at the Mexican border. The president on Wednesday left a negotiating session after clashing with top Democratic lawmakers, and Trump stated Thursday that he could declare a national emergency in order to build his wall if there's no deal with Democrats, saying probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. Analysts have noted the impact of the current shutdown is somewhat limited, because it's only affecting agencies that represent about 25% of total government spending.\n\nThis report was first published on Jan. 8, 2019.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Still-low inflation readings and signs that inflation might actually soften in the near term made the Federal Reserve's rate hike a close call for some officials, according to the minutes of the December 15-16 meeting, released Wednesday. Fed officials voted unanimously last month to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 but the minutes make clear that some were more reluctant to hike than others. Going forward, the central bankers agreed to add to the policy statement that they were watching actual and expected progress towards to 2% inflation target carefully because of their significant concern about still-low readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook. More generally, Fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside.
Before heading to Davos, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was asked about the wave of companies who are saying they are increasing wages or bonuses due to the recently enacted tax cuts.\n\nYou know, look, if they had their money in their coffers, they could have done it last year, the year before, the year before, the year before, Cohn said Tuesday.\n\nAnd we've seen the tax plan mentioned directly that companies now feel more comfortable about the economic position they're in, they feel better about the U.S. economy, they feel more confident about their earnings, and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees. So I think there's a 100% correlation between what we've seen these almost close to 200 companies do and what we have done from a regulatory standpoint and more on a tax policy standpoint.\n\nA 100% correlation? Here's a look at what the companies have said and what they've done.\n\nThe first item is to look at what companies have said. The Grover Norquist-led Americans for Tax Reform has been keeping an exhaustive list, relying not just on press releases but also news stories and reader submissions. The benefit of using this list is also that it's the most generous tabulation — this is an organization that was wildly enthusiastic about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nA few things become clear when looking at the list. One is that, generally, the companies are making one-time payments, typically on the order of $1,000 per non-executive employee. A notable minority also mention lifting their minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nWhat kind of bonus was the typical worker already getting?\n\nThere isn't a nice, neat average bonus figure readily available, but you can mix and match data to get to a very rough estimate. Labor Department data finds that, on a per-hour basis, employers paid out nonproduction bonuses equal to 3.2% of the wages and salaries per worker. Data released earlier this month shows the typical full-time worker made $857 per week, before bonuses.\n\nIf you apply a ratio derived from an employer survey, to one derived from employee data (yes, yes, that's not terrific practice), you arrive at an average annual bonus of $1,426.\n\nThat should be read as the average bonus every worker is receiving. Some obviously get nothing, while some make thousands more. Nearly 40% of private-sector workers are eligible for a bonus, but some smaller percentage actually get them.\n\nNow, some of the companies made pains to say that they were paying a bonus above and beyond what they previously were intending. Short of truth serum, it's hard to really know.\n\nBut employers are directing these bonuses to workers who aren't typically receiving them. Employers have been paying out bonuses equal to 4.7% of wages and salaries for management, professional and related fields, but just 0.8% for service employees. The announcements make clear the bonuses are for the rank and file, not management.\n\nThe next question to ask is whether the companies are making the announcement because of the tax cuts, or whether they're dressing up what they had already been doing to curry favor from a particularly sensitive administration.\n\nAT&T T, -0.46% , for instance, had already agreed to the bonus in talks with its union, when it made its announcement on Dec. 20. That said, the Communications Workers of America told ThinkProgress — a website of a left-wing policy group — that AT&T agreed to the bonuses after the CWA argued employees should get the $4,000 wage increase that the White House promised the tax cut would provide. That actually argues in favor of the Cohn point — the tax cuts led to an economic environment resulting in increased pay for workers.\n\nThe fact is, however, that the companies making these announcements are typically in highly regulated industries. AT&T, which has been trying to win support for its Time Warner US:TWX merger, kicked off these announcements, and it is mostly banks, from giants like Bank of America BAC, +2.61% to lesser-known lenders like Bank of Advance and Flushing Financial Corp., FFIC, +0.62% announcing them. Several utilities have additionally announced planned rate cuts.\n\nThe last word here on tax cuts and worker pay goes to Cohn's former employer, Goldman Sachs. In a research note, the firm looked at both the corporate PR announcements and the minimum wage hikes in 18 states.\n\nIn practice, we expect no significant short-term effect of tax reform on average hourly earnings — as it excludes irregular bonuses — and only a marginal boost to the employment cost index — as irregular bonuses are smoothed out, according to a note written by economist Daan Struyven.\n\nIrregular bonuses may provide a more meaningful lift to fourth-quarter compensation per hour, but it will likely also be offset by potential individual income shifting. More significant effects from tax reform seem more likely in the next few quarters via a tighter labor market.\n\nIn other words, no, these PR announcements aren't really evidence of the economy getting better for workers in a meaningful way. But tax reform may yet make things better. It's too early to tell.\n\nHere's what is real — what companies are giving to investors. According to data from TrimTabs, 23 companies have announced stock buybacks worth a cumulative $33.8 billion since the tax cuts became law, and the firm expects announcements to pick up as more companies report earnings in coming weeks.
Bank of America and other major consumer-facing lenders are assessing the use of credit cards to purchase bitcoin and other virtual currencies, which could result in restrictions or limits.\n\nA Bank of America BAC, +2.61% spokeswoman in San Francisco told MarketWatch that the bank was reviewing its policies related to the purchase of such crypto assets as bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.68% but declined to discuss further.\n\nCitigroup Inc. C, +0.33% said it hasn't changed its policy but will continue to monitor this evolving space, in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the bank's planning who declined to be identified.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Capital One Financial Corp. COF, -2.54% banned customers from using credit cards to purchase bitcoin or coins on the Ethereum blockchain, citing limiting mainstream acceptance and the elevated risks of fraud, loss and volatility.\n\nAttempts to reach Capital One for comment were not immediately successful.\n\nBanks taking a harder look at the use of debt to buy digital assets come as bitcoin and its rivals have ballooned in popularity in recent months. The fervor around virtual coins has been compared with tulip mania, with as prominent a banker as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s CEO Jamie Dimon at one point describing the craze over bitcoin and its brethren as a fraud and speculative bubble that will end badly. A call to J.P. Morgan about its credit-card policy toward bitcoin weren't immediately returned.\n\nRead:Dimon's many bitcoin moments of regret, in one chart\n\nThe price of a single bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 last December but has since cooled considerably amid a wave of heightened scrutiny from regulators in Asia and a domestic intent to tamp down speculation. Bitcoin has lost about half its value since its peak last year but is still up 1,025% since the end of 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up 34% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% has gained 27% over the period.\n\nThe banking sector might be particular wary of bitcoin because digital assets, many of which run on decentralized, distributed-ledger technologies, have been associated with money laundering and criminal activity.\n\nStill bitcoin has gained wider acceptance on Wall Street with the CME Group Inc. and the Cboe Global Markets kicking off trading last month in cash-settled bitcoin futures.\n\nMost recently a single bitcoin was trading at $10,975, off 3.7%, according to research and data site Coindesk.com, while futures on the Cboe US:XBTG8 for February were off 2.4% at $10,930 and January CME futures US:BTCF8 were down 2.1% at $10,880.
Gold settled higher on Wednesday, as a benchmark dollar index dropped to a three-month low. Prices for the precious metal then extended gains into electronic trading shortly after minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting revealed that some Federal Reserve members wanted to hold policy steady in December.

'i am doubling down, because as prices move further away from trend, at accelerating speed and with growing speculative fervor, of course my confidence as a market historian increases that this is indeed the late stage of a bubble. a bubble that is beginning to look like a real humdinger.' \n\nthat is jeremy grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist at boston-based money manager grantham, mayo, van otterloo & co., in a research report dated tuesday after a particularly withering year for his investment outfit in 2020.\n\ngrantham's bearish view on valuations was reflected in gmo's investment strategy which trailed the s&p 500 index spx, +0.29% , according to a report by bloomberg news late last year which noted that clients had pulled $2.2 billion from the fund as of november 2020.\n\nlast year was a remarkable year for risk assets in the face of a global viral epidemic that left equity indexes initially reeling in the spring, only to stage a spectacular rebound in the ensuing months as fiscal and monetary policy contributed to an economic recovery.\n\nthe s&p 500 spx, +0.29% and the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% posted impressive gains in 2020, despite an initial bear market a decline of at least 20% and a recovery from those march lows of over 60%, while the nasdaq composite index comp, +0.40% surged more than 80% from its nadir.\n\nthe dow jones industrial average finished 2020 up 7.25% in 2020, while the s&p500 index gained 16.26% and the nasdaq composite returned 43.64%.\n\ngrantham however says that the market's bubblicious state has accelerated since he last declared values inflated and referenced a quote often attributed to famed economist john maynard keynes stipulating that the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\n\nin grantham's words either way, the market is now checking off all the touchy-feely characteristics of a major bubble.\n\nhe also mentions the surge in interest in electric-vehicle makers like tesla inc. tsla, +3.68% as evidence of the market's speculative fervor.\n\nthe most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears, he writes.\n\nwhat's a prudent investor to do with one of the legends of wall street signaling caution is warranted?\n\ngrantham says assets considered value, or trading at a discount based on some metric and emerging markets may be better bets in the near term. he said such bets go along with the greatest avoidance of u.s. growth stocks that your career and business risk will allow.\n\ndespite his recent challenges calling a top, grantham is worth paying attention to due to his prescient calls over the years. he said that stocks were overvalued in 2000 and again in 2007, anticipating those market downturns, the wall street journal reports. grantham also signaled that elements of the financial market had become unmoored from reality leading up to the 2008-09 financial crisis.
Paying your dues might seem old-school to many these days, but there are some surprising benefits to grunt work. Not only did plenty of super-successful people start on the lowest rung of the ladder, but their early experiences in low-level positions frequently seeded their path to success—whether inspiring future projects, teaching them valuable workplace lessons or offering low-risk opportunities to up their game.\n\nCheck out how these seven went from small potatoes to success stories.\n\nThe Amazon AMZN, -3.44% head honcho landed a summer job in his teens as a grill man, flipping burgers at McDonald's.

But he was a far cry from your average paperboy, taking an ambitious approach to his route that hints at the incredible drive and savvy he wields now.\n\nAccording to the biography The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life, he brainstormed strategies to deliver his papers as fast as possible, sold calendars and magazine subscriptions on the side and took in $2,000 in two years. At 15, he hammered out a profit-share agreement with a farmer in Nebraska and invested $1,200 of those earnings in a 40-acre farm.

The MetroCard mayor pledged to commute to work via mass transit, promoted bike lanes and a bike-share program in NYC and created exclusive high-speed bus lanes. More recently, Bloomberg has emerged as a champion for global road safety, dedicating $250 million from his charitable foundation to improve conditions and promote bike and mass transit use around the world.\n\nBeyoncé: salon sweeper\n\nBeyoncé: sweeping floors.

Armed with an M.B.A., he landed a position at the Bentonville, Ark. headquarters and rose quickly through the ranks as a buyer, merchandise manager and senior VP. He snagged a major promotion in 2006, when he was named CEO of Sam's Club, a Wal-Mart WMT, -1.31% subsidiary.

That was really intriguing for me.\n\nWord is still out on the inspiration behind McDreamy.
Congressional earmarks – otherwise known as pork barrel spending – may be coming back.\n\nFor decades, earmarks paid for pet projects back in lawmakers' districts, with the tacit aim to earn those lawmakers votes. In turn, the awards encouraged legislators to vote for large spending bills. They have long been seen by many members of the public as well as some lawmakers as wasteful and distasteful, and they were banned in 2011.\n\nNow, following the 2020 election, House Democrats have apparently decided to return to the practice. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland announced on Nov. 20 that the Appropriations Committee would soon begin soliciting member requests for earmarks, with a focus on projects that would benefit nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.\n\nAlthough the Senate has appeared more committed to its ban, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and other Senate Republicans and Democrats are also receptive to reviving earmarking.\n\nFederal spending bills normally allocate an amount of money for general purposes and often defer to federal agency officials or state leaders to determine which particular projects best meet the overall goals. Earmarks are specific congressional instructions that carve out some of those funds, declaring directly that X amount of money must be spent on Y project.\n\nBefore 2011, earmarks were regularly and – until 2007 – in increasingly large numbers inserted into appropriations and highway funding bills.\n\nWhile earmarks have been condemned as frivolous at best and corrupt at worst, research on their uses and effects paints a more complex picture of their dynamics. My own research, as well as that of Frances Lee, shows that such projects helped transportation committee leaders pass three massive highway bills, overcoming significant policy controversies.\n\n'Reeking of corruption'\n\nNevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. Then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in 2018 called earmarks the Washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. To supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of Congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. And not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.\n\nSince 2018, many have argued for a return to earmarking to grease the wheels for appropriations bills. Pro-earmark arguments have come from members of Congress of both parties and President Donald Trump.\n\nThe current impetus among House Democrats also may be driven by their losses in the 2020 election. The Democrats' new majority is currently at 222, compared with 211 for the Republicans, with two seats still undecided.\n\nGiven that the party of the president almost always loses seats in midterm elections, Democrats could lose their majority altogether in the 2022 congressional elections. Earmarks could help endangered Democrats shore up their support among voters back home.\n\nHow to pass bills\n\nEfforts to revive earmarking over the past few years have been driven by an additional factor: Congress' near total inability to pass individual spending bills in a timely manner since the ban was adopted.\n\nIn the normal appropriations process, Congress would pass 12 individual spending bills each year, a process designed to give legislators a chance to examine the spending in each bill before voting.\n\nThe reality is far different.\n\nData compiled by the Pew Research Center show that between the 2011 earmark ban and fiscal 2018, only one individual appropriations bill was enacted, rather than the 84 appropriations bills Congress should have passed. Individual appropriations bills have fared just as poorly in more recent years.\n\nInstead, Congress has funded government agencies in massive omnibus appropriations bills, and partial- and full-year continuing resolutions, making it virtually impossible for members to know what they were voting for.\n\nThis breakdown in the regular appropriations process coincides neatly with the earmark moratorium, although before the 2011 moratorium, the process did not always go smoothly.\n\nMy own research shows that between 1994 and 2000, as Congress went from Democratic to Republican control, earmarks, once highly effective in inducing members to vote for appropriations bills, became gradually less so.\n\nPartisanship could undermine earmarks' effectiveness\n\nMy interviews with committee staff members suggested various reasons for this diminished effectiveness. Prominent among them, according to one staffer, was the fact that votes were increasingly … on highly charged substantive policy matters. Senators needed to vote on those issues in a partisan manner, regardless of earmarks.\n\nAnother staffer blamed the failure of leaders to punish disloyal members by removing their earmarks.\n\nThat staffer said, People have no shame. They vote no and take the dough.\n\nIt is difficult to predict how returning to pork-barrel spending would work today.\n\nFor earmarks to be effective tools, members might have to vote contrary to their own or their party's preferences. Their willingness to do so would undoubtedly depend partly on the electoral consequences.\n\nAs political scientist David Mayhew has argued, members believe that bringing home district benefits gives them something for which to claim credit, enhancing their chances for reelection and providing congressional leaders with leverage over their votes.\n\nThe evidence for this effect is nuanced, however.\n\nEarmarks can help members win reelection, especially when members claim credit for them.\n\nBut there is evidence that constituents are more likely to reward Democrats than Republicans. This is not entirely surprising, given that earmarks are consistent with Democrats' commitment to activist government, whereas for Republicans committed to minimizing the cost of government, bringing home earmarks could be painted as hypocritical.\n\nThese differences could help explain why, in my research, earmarks provided leaders with less leverage over members' votes in Republican-controlled congresses.\n\n'Gateway drug'\n\nThe negative effects of earmarking for Republicans may have grown more powerful. Over the past two decades, critics of earmarks have framed them as egregious government waste.\n\nThe late Sen. John McCain, for example, called earmarks the gateway drug to corruption and overspending.\n\nBut overspending is in the eye of the beholder. At their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (Discretionary spending is money over which Congress has direct control, unlike Social Security or Medicare, for example.) As a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that Democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.\n\nEarmarks are vulnerable to other criticisms as well, not least of which is the disproportionate share awarded to the states and districts of the most powerful members.\n\nIn addition, the majority party gets disproportionately more earmarks than the minority, although the minority gets enough to make it harder for them to use earmarks as a campaign issue.\n\nAs Congress wrestles with the process of passing individual appropriations bills, congressional leaders are poised to once again allow earmarks in appropriations bills to ease the bills' passage and protect vulnerable Democrats at the polls.\n\nDiana Evans is a professor of political science at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn. This was first published by The Conversation — The 'gateway drug to corruption and overspending' is returning to Congress – but are earmarks really that bad?
Years ago, you'd visit your grandparents in a gated community and think, I'd never want to live here.\n\nNow that you're nearing (or past) retirement, you think, I may move to a gated community.\n\nThat's the cycle of life.\n\nThe larger question is whether you'll thrive in these planned developments springing up around the country. The real estate brochures make them sound heavenly: gorgeous homes, no crime, fun activities. But problems might lurk behind the ritzy clubhouse, artificial lakes and stunning views.\n\nMany of these communities restrict residents to age 55 and up. That can attract older people who welcome the chance to kick back and relax with their own kind.\n\nFor many of them, this is the last time they're going to buy a home, said Michelle Ames, a real-estate broker in Frisco, Texas. They're looking to shelter in place, and they want to do it with lots of like-minded people.\n\nSurrounding yourself with neighbors in your age bracket might sound appealing—until you get to know them. The bevy of rules that govern gated communities can lead to bickering among residents who tattle on each other for minor infractions.\n\nRegulations can range from paint colors for your house to parking in front of it. In some cases, rules about house guests stipulate you can only host children for a limited time such as 90 days a year. And if you intend to generate rental income, some communities impose a one-month minimum to avoid Airbnb-like coming and going.\n\nBefore buying, know the rules and make sure you can live with them. The homeowners association maintains a compilation of do's and don'ts—often called CC&Rs [covenants, conditions and restrictions]—that you'll want to read.\n\nThere are a lot of rules and they exist for a reason, said Lisa Corbin, a recently divorced homeowner in her late 50s who moved into a gated community in La Quinta, Calif. Our CC&Rs are 3,000 pages. They cover everything from the plants and trees you can have to not keeping your garage door open.\n\nWhen house hunting last year, Corbin visited gated communities in Southern California's Coachella Valley. But rather than just meet with real-estate agents, she ventured on her own into clubhouses to chat with residents and solicit their input.\n\nI'd ask, 'What do you think of living here?' and people really opened up, she recalled. They might complain about a special assessment added to their homeowner dues to pay for roof repairs or the restrictive policy regarding the type and number of dogs you could have.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, you'll want to consider the monthly dues, what they cover and whether they're likely to go up. Well-run homeowner associations maintain fully funded reserves rather than relying on steep assessments from time to time to cover deferred maintenance and other costs.\n\nSafety is a big attraction, especially for single retirees who welcome the security of living in a gated enclave. But even if drivers can only enter through a central gate where a guard in a kiosk confirms their identity, perils remain.\n\nIn a gated community near me, a minivan was stolen out of a driveway when the thieves got in through a hole in a fence, Ames said. Unless you want to put concertina wire along the top of your wall, you can't be totally secure.\n\nIn some communities, residents volunteer on their neighborhood watch patrol by driving around the property. And homeowners may install home security systems as an added precaution.\n\nBut if architectural conformity appeals to you and you're tired of skateboarding kids and baby-strolling moms clogging your street, an age-55 and over gated community might make sense. And if you don't enjoy hiring a gardener, mowing your lawn or cursing speeders who plague your neighborhood, then a gated community can deliver the peace and quiet you covet.

The Japanese yen USDJPY, -0.01% strengthened against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda affirmed the central bank would continue to support the Japanese economy through monetary easing. Kuroda also said that inflation was finally getting close to the BOJ's target of 2% and that there would be a slight pickup in inflation expectations. Japan is understood to have the loosest approach to monetary policy among the developed economies, and is expected to be one of the last to join the trend of policy normalization. The dollar last bought ¥108.95, down from ¥109.41. The pair touched its lowest level since September on Thursday.
President Trump has said American workers have been front and center of his campaign and his presidency. The agenda I will layout this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda, it's the agenda of the American people. Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers, the president said in his State of the Union speech on Feb. 5\n\n 'Many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers.' \n\nThe U.S. gained 304,000 new jobs in January, although hiring at the end of 2018 wasn't as strong as originally reported. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from 3.9% and the 12-month rate of hourly wage gains dipped to 3.2% from a revised 3.3% in the prior three months that marked a post-recession high.\n\nUnder a host of new laws that will go into effect in 2019, however, states are taking it upon themselves to change employees' lives, from how much they earn, to their comfort and security in the workplace, to their ability to plan for their futures.\n\nA handful of states have increased the minimum wage to between $12 and $15, and others have implemented regulations that focus on preventing sexual harassment, saving for retirement and fostering a more gender-diverse work environment.\n\n 'With the Trump administration and Republican Congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation.'  — —Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project\n\nWith the Trump administration and Republican Congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation, said Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project, a liberal-leaning think tank that advocates for workers' rights.\n\nSee: Feel like your workplace is especially depressing? Scientists found out why\n\nHere are some laws that went into effect in 2019, and other legislation expected later this year:\n\nIncreasing minimum wage\n\nNineteen states and 21 cities and counties increased their minimum wage in January, with many raising it to $15 an hour. Another 21 jurisdictions will raise pay by the end of the year, according to the National Employment Law Project.\n\nStates that increased minimum wage at the beginning of the year include: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Washington.\n\n 'Cost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like Texas and Florida.'  — —Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project\n\nCost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like Texas and Florida, Sonn said. This will put thousands more in the pockets of struggling workers who right now are often going into debt and just aren't able to afford the basics.\n\nSee also:This is how many million U.S. workers will get a pay raise in the new year\n\nAttracting more workers\n\nVermont began its Remote Worker Grant Program, which reimburses workers who move to Vermont for expenses including relocation costs, computer software and broadband access. The program pays remote workers up to $5,000 every year, up to a total of $10,000, when they move to the state. Lawmakers created the program to help reverse the trend of an aging and declining population and to draw more tech workers.\n\nDon't miss:Ways your workplace wellness program could actually be making you fat\n\nNo perks for some fired government workers\n\nIllinois passed a law that bans government employees fired for misconduct from cashing in on severance pay. As part of Senate Bill 3604, misconduct refers to deliberate or careless actions that harm others or go against employer standards of behavior. It also includes chronic absenteeism, tardiness and criminal assault on another employee or customer. The law affects all government workers, as well as those who work for state colleges and universities and school districts. Under the law, any government worker fired for misconduct wouldn't be allowed to collect any severance pay.\n\nThwarting sexual harassment\n\nA California law that went into effect on Jan. 1 prohibits secret settlement agreements pertaining to sexual harassment or sex discrimination. The legislation, which applies to public and private employers, allows victims to stay anonymous if they want to remain out of the public eye, but allows victims to pursue civil action.\n\n 'We've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years.'  — —Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women's Law Center\n\nThe #MeToo movement, originally sparked by high-profile cases of sexual misconduct in Hollywood, quickly spread to other industries and has changed America's workplaces. Companies and policymakers are looking for solutions, Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women's Law Center, told MarketWatch last year. We've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years, she said.\n\nCalifornia has also become the first state to require some company boards to have at least one female member. Any publicly traded company with headquarters in the state must have one woman board member by the end of 2019 and, by 2021, companies with at least five directors need to have two or three female directors, depending on the size of the board.\n\nAlso see: Sheryl Sandberg thinks the workplace is 'rigged' against women — but these steps could fix that\n\nAn eye on retirement\n\nA retirement crisis is looming in the country. Americans are not saving enough for their futures and in many cases, don't have access to a workplace retirement account to start. States have taken it upon themselves to implement retirement plans, and in some cases, require companies to offer a retirement plan if they have no alternatives in place.\n\nCalifornia's program, called CalSavers, will open to all eligible workers this July. Oregon was the first state to implement its state-sponsored retirement program, and Illinois has also started its own program. More states are expected to implement or propose similar legislation in the coming years.
The investment boom that began in 2016 is fading fast, quashing the never-realistic hopes of Republicans that the corporate tax cut had permanently transformed the economy for the better.\n\nThere's good reason to believe that the tax cut had almost no impact on business investment. Rather, it was strong demand, especially for oil, that encouraged businesses to expand capacity. Now investment is softening along with aggregate demand.\n\nA year ago, Republicans were predicting that their big tax cut for businesses would create a virtuous cycle of higher fixed investment, leading to higher growth rates lasting for years.\n\nA month ago, White House economist Kevin Hassett was insisting that everything was still going as planned. He declared that companies were investing more in equipment, software and facilities, enough to propel U.S. potential growth from an anemic 2% to a stellar 3% or more.\n\nAs he often is, Hassett was too cheery.\n\nNow, hopes that the investment boom would continue into 2019 are in tatters, victim to four factors that are dragging on the economy: reduced fiscal stimulus (including the shutdown), a weakening global economy, the uncertainty of Donald Trump's trade policy and soft oil prices.\n\nCapex plans scaled back\n\nThose four interrelated trends are weighing on aggregate demand in the U.S. and global economies, forcing companies to scale back their investment plans. It's already visible in the data and in surveys of business expectations.\n\nIt's important to define terms from the start. When economists talk about investment, they aren't talking about putting money into the stock market. They are talking about building and maintaining productive assets that will continue to create value for years.\n\nThere are three broad classes of fixed investment: structures, such as factories, oil wells and housing; equipment, such as machinery, airplanes and computers; and intellectual property, such as software, new drugs, and blockbuster Hollywood movies.\n\nAlso read:The 15 U.S. companies that are investing the most in tomorrow's big ideas\n\nBusinesses invest when they believe demand for their products will rise. Right now, fewer companies are confident of that future revenue. Most of the leading indicators of demand are slumping as the new year begins.\n\nSurveys of manufacturing executives show that the giddy optimism of early 2018 has turned to caution. The new orders component of the ISM manufacturing index, for instance, plunged 11 points in December. Company guidance, U.S. regional surveys and global purchasing managers surveys are telling the same story: Companies are scaling back their plans for capital spending.\n\nEconomists at Morgan Stanley say their capex plans index (which is based on the regional Fed surveys of capital-spending expectations) has fallen in eight of the past nine months to the lowest level in a year.\n\nThe continued softening in the index indicates restrained capital spending activity in 2019 as the shine of tax stimulus fades, and slower global growth, uncertainty around trade policy, and tighter financial conditions weigh on investment plans, said Morgan Stanley economist Molly Wharton in a note to clients.\n\nHard data also show that capital spending is softening. Real business investment surged at a 10% annual pace in the first half of the year, but slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter. Core capital equipment orders and shipments slowed through November, and private nonresidential construction spending has also weakened.\n\nUnfortunately, the government shutdown means this key data isn't being reported or collected. It's never a good time to fly blind, doubly so now.\n\nImpact of oil prices\n\nThere's something else going on besides weak aggregate demand: The impact of oil prices on U.S. investment is underappreciated.\n\nIt used to be that changes in oil prices mainly affected consumption — lower prices boosted the economy by making energy consumers richer, while higher prices frequently led to recessions. But since the fracking revolution earlier in this decade, changes in oil prices have become highly correlated with changes in investment.\n\nTraditional oil production is based on long-lasting projects requiring huge investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. The analysis of the profitability of, say, an offshore drilling project doesn't depend on spot crude oil prices US:CLG9, but on prices expected for the duration of the project's life. Temporary fluctuations in oil prices won't affect this kind of investment.\n\nBut producing oil from shale is different in an important way: The investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. This means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.\n\nThat creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. High prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. The dip in U.S. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.\n\nOil accounted for all growth\n\nAfter a study of county-level economic data, Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.\n\nAlexander Arnon of the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated in a blog post titled The Price of Oil is Now a Key Driver of Business Investment that firmer oil prices accounted for almost all of the growth in investment in 2018.\n\nMost oil investments aren't profitable if the price falls much below $50 a barrel. Dallas Federal Reserve\n\nUnfortunately, oil prices have fallen again. Oil prices, which were near $70 in October, fell to $43 in mid-December and are now around $52. That's right at the midpoint of profitability for most fracking projects, according to the Dallas Fed's Energy Survey.\n\nThe current level of oil prices puts energy investment on a cusp, wrote Carpenter of UBS. Further declines in the price of West Texas Intermediate are likely to have a substantively negative effect on energy's contribution to U.S. GDP.\n\nManufacturers in the Dallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve districts have noticed, Morgan Stanley's Wharton points out. Declining oil prices are a concern going into the first quarter of 2019, one fabricated metal product manufacturer told the Dallas Fed in December. About half of energy firms in the district have lowered their capital spending plans for 2019.\n\nLikewise, oil and gas drilling activity in the Minneapolis Fed district slowed notably recently in response to a rapid decline in the price of crude oil, according to the latest Beige Book. An industry contact reported that expectations for capital expenditures in the Bakken oil patch have shifted downward dramatically.\n\nThe incentives in the 2017 tax cut had almost nothing to do with the investment boom we saw in 2017 and 2018, which helps explain why many corporate executives and macro-economists don't think the tax cut transformed the economy at all.\n\nFor instance, IHS Markit is predicting that U.S. gross domestic product will fade from 2.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2023. The Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the IMF and other forecasters agree that the tax cut was a temporary jolt, not a game-changer.\n\nThe U.S. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. The tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. Maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.
To hear Brenda Robertson tell it, Georgia needs someone like Raphael Warnock in the Senate.\n\nIt was so important to get over here and do this today, Robertson, 68, told MarketWatch in an Election Day interview outside a polling station in Chatham County on Tuesday.\n\nRobertson, like other voters in her county and around the Peach State, was casting her ballot in pivotal elections that will decide control of the U.S. Senate and thus how far President-elect Joe Biden can push his agenda.\n\nNow see: Betting markets and polls give edge to Democrats in Georgia's crucial Senate runoff elections\n\nTight contests are expected as Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Warnock are facing off against Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. If the Republicans win just one of the seats, they'll remain in the Senate majority and put a check on the agenda of Biden and the Democratic-run House of Representatives.\n\nChatham County, with Savannah as its largest city, voted heavily in favor of Democrats during the November election — a switch from its long history of supporting Republican candidates.\n\nOn Tuesday, residents were out in force in the county, where MarketWatch visited two polling locations.\n\nFifty-six-year-old Herbert Chaplin got to Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and said he wanted to make sure he cast his ballot before it was too late.\n\nThat one vote I cast is going to count, and I make sure since I was 18 years old that I always get my vote in, said the Democrat. Outside the church, a DJ was playing a mixture of hip-hop and R&B.\n\nVolunteers from the group WokeVote outside the Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah on Tuesday. Donnell Suggs\n\nBoth Biden and President Donald Trump visited the state to rally voters on Monday. Some Chatham County residents, however, needed no prodding.\n\nAlso read: Georgia voters head to polls in pivotal runoffs — but it may be a long wait until winners are known.\n\nThe only thing that would have stopped me from voting today was the Lord, said Johnny Simpson, a 60-year-old retiree, who voted at Jonesville Baptist Church.\n\nAt a polling station at a Salvation Army on Bee Road in Savannah, election official Sharon Chisholm was watching a steady stream of voters and observed that the whole nation has its eyes on Georgia.\n\nThough betting markets and polls gave the edge to Democrats on the eve of the runoffs, not all observers are convinced.\n\nVeda's base case expectation continues to be that Republicans will win the two Georgia Senate seats, wrote Henrietta Treyz, director of economic policy at Veda Partners, in a note on Tuesday.
SolarCity said Wednesday it is eliminating more than 550 jobs in Nevada as it continues a campaign against new, government-mandated solar metering rates.\n\nNevada's public commission said late last month that solar-panel users would get paid for their energy at lower, wholesale rates instead of at the higher, retail rates they had previously received. The commission also ordered public utility NV Energy to increase the monthly service charge for solar-panel users.
