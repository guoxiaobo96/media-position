Chatham County, with Savannah as its largest city, voted heavily in favor of Democrats during the November election — a switch from its long history of supporting Republican candidates.
The voting members did say that they didn't see the need for many more interest-rate hikes.
Here are some laws that went into effect in 2019, and other legislation expected later this year:
A California law that went into effect on Jan. 1 prohibits secret settlement agreements pertaining to sexual harassment or sex discrimination. The legislation, which applies to public and private employers, allows victims to stay anonymous if they want to remain out of the public eye, but allows victims to pursue civil action.
Under Trump, the CFPB wants to cut down on corporate red tape
Under the new lockdown, all hospitality venues and nonessential shops must remain closed until at least mid February, heaping more pressure on those already-struggling sectors.

Microloans disbursed in 2014: $8.4 million
Nonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender.
Trump, China diverge on new world order
LONDON (Project Syndicate) — One of the most extraordinary things about the current protests in Iran — the largest since the Green Movement in 2009 — is that the very people that they are directed against may well have been the people who started them. Iran's ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate President Hassan Rouhani.
Valley Economic Development Corp. specializes in small-business loans and microfinancing for entrepreneurs who don't qualify for loans from traditional banks. It's based in Los Angeles but also operates in other states, including Nevada, Illinois and New York. Aside from the SBA Community Advantage program, it participates in other small-business financing programs, including the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, the National African-American Small-Business Loan Fund and the National Microfinance Network.
The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. America's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… Almost all of the policy discourse in Washington, D.C. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in American society. This kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.

The agency fined Wells Fargo WFC, +2.43% $100 million in September 2016 for alleged illegal practices including opening as many as two million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' knowledge. (Wells Fargo did not confirm or deny the charges but agreed to pay the fine and later fired more than 5,000 employees because of improper sales practices.) At the time, Republicans said the CFPB acted slowly on the Wells Fargo case.
Norway was also No. 1 out of 155 countries on the 2017 World Happiness Report, up from No. 4 the year before, followed by Denmark (last year's No. 1), Iceland and Switzerland. The U.S. was trailing at No. 14. These four countries rank highly on all the main factors found to support happiness: caring, freedom, generosity, honesty, health, income and good governance. Their averages are so close that small changes can re-order the rankings from year to year, the report said.
The FOMC judged that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening would likely be appropriate, the minutes said.
For earmarks to be effective tools, members might have to vote contrary to their own or their party's preferences. Their willingness to do so would undoubtedly depend partly on the electoral consequences.
Don't miss:Less than half of Americans say they're middle class
This report was first published on Jan. 8, 2019.
Illinois passed a law that bans government employees fired for misconduct from cashing in on severance pay. As part of Senate Bill 3604, misconduct refers to deliberate or careless actions that harm others or go against employer standards of behavior. It also includes chronic absenteeism, tardiness and criminal assault on another employee or customer. The law affects all government workers, as well as those who work for state colleges and universities and school districts. Under the law, any government worker fired for misconduct wouldn't be allowed to collect any severance pay.
grantham's bearish view on valuations was reflected in gmo's investment strategy which trailed the s&p 500 index spx, +0.29% , according to a report by bloomberg news late last year which noted that clients had pulled $2.2 billion from the fund as of november 2020.
Though financial conditions had tightened and global growth had moderated, [voting] members generally anticipated that growth would remain above trend and the labor market would remain strong, the minutes said.
If you're a small-business owner on a quest for capital, there are several smart reasons to turn to nonprofit microlenders. These lenders go beyond making small loans to entrepreneurs and provide some benefits that traditional lenders don't:
Manufacturers in the Dallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve districts have noticed, Morgan Stanley's Wharton points out. Declining oil prices are a concern going into the first quarter of 2019, one fabricated metal product manufacturer told the Dallas Fed in December. About half of energy firms in the district have lowered their capital spending plans for 2019.
Earmarks are vulnerable to other criticisms as well, not least of which is the disproportionate share awarded to the states and districts of the most powerful members.
Chairwoman Janet Yellen has said the Fed would hold the balance sheet steady by reinvesting proceeds of maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from mortgage-backed securities until the process of normalization of the federal funds rate is well underway.
Nevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. Then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in 2018 called earmarks the Washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. To supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of Congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. And not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.
Surrounding yourself with neighbors in your age bracket might sound appealing—until you get to know them. The bevy of rules that govern gated communities can lead to bickering among residents who tattle on each other for minor infractions.
An Urban Institute study of 60 U.S. cities discovered that the predominately white areas had a median credit score 80 points higher than in predominately non-white neighborhoods, which can cost families of color $100 or more each month on a mortgage. And the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances found that African-American households are twice as likely as white household to be late on credit payments.
Efforts to revive earmarking over the past few years have been driven by an additional factor: Congress' near total inability to pass individual spending bills in a timely manner since the ban was adopted.
Business leaders welcomed the support package, but warned that on its own, the support wasn't enough to keep businesses afloat longer term.
When house hunting last year, Corbin visited gated communities in Southern California's Coachella Valley. But rather than just meet with real-estate agents, she ventured on her own into clubhouses to chat with residents and solicit their input.
The group's report cites a Tax Policy Center estimate that the new tax law will translate to a $51,140 tax cut for the wealthiest 1% of households, but families earning less than $25,000 in 2018 will see a mere $60 in tax savings. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) just took heat for tweeting about a Pennsylvania high-school secretary who was pleasantly surprised her paycheck rose $1.50 a week due to the tax cut.
SBA Community Advantage and microloans disbursed in 2015: $6.6 million
When it comes to a trade war, many regard Trump as a risk. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping lauded globalization and said no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. It wouldn't be far fetched to imagine those comments were made in response to promises from Trump to slap tariffs on Chinese goods to lift U.S. manufacturing.
A month ago, White House economist Kevin Hassett was insisting that everything was still going as planned. He declared that companies were investing more in equipment, software and facilities, enough to propel U.S. potential growth from an anemic 2% to a stellar 3% or more.
Fed officials pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different path of policy than the currently expected, the minutes said.
But this would hardly count as success for the protesters. After all, Rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm. If protecting their government's religious purity — and their own ill-gotten gains — required brutally repressing their own people and returning Iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.
 'With the Trump administration and Republican Congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation.'  — —Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project
The new leadership has taken over at a time when consumers are struggling with credit-card, auto loan and student loan debt.
That should be read as the average bonus every worker is receiving. Some obviously get nothing, while some make thousands more. Nearly 40% of private-sector workers are eligible for a bonus, but some smaller percentage actually get them.
In practice, we expect no significant short-term effect of tax reform on average hourly earnings — as it excludes irregular bonuses — and only a marginal boost to the employment cost index — as irregular bonuses are smoothed out, according to a note written by economist Daan Struyven.

Congressional earmarks – otherwise known as pork barrel spending – may be coming back.
Instead, Congress has funded government agencies in massive omnibus appropriations bills, and partial- and full-year continuing resolutions, making it virtually impossible for members to know what they were voting for.
California's program, called CalSavers, will open to all eligible workers this July. Oregon was the first state to implement its state-sponsored retirement program, and Illinois has also started its own program. More states are expected to implement or propose similar legislation in the coming years.
In addition, the majority party gets disproportionately more earmarks than the minority, although the minority gets enough to make it harder for them to use earmarks as a campaign issue.
For decades, earmarks paid for pet projects back in lawmakers' districts, with the tacit aim to earn those lawmakers votes. In turn, the awards encouraged legislators to vote for large spending bills. They have long been seen by many members of the public as well as some lawmakers as wasteful and distasteful, and they were banned in 2011.
Amid the current protests, however, the West has an opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on its desperate domestic situation. If an agreement is reached, existing sanctions can be reduced; if Iran's leaders refuse to budge, new sanctions could be introduced.
Nevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. Then-Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., in 2018 called earmarks the Washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. To supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of Congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. And not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.
Robertson, like other voters in her county and around the Peach State, was casting her ballot in pivotal elections that will decide control of the U.S. Senate and thus how far President-elect Joe Biden can push his agenda.
Gold prices gave up earlier lows on Wednesday to end higher for a fifth session, then eased back in electronic trading from their settlement shortly after the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book. The report, which offers a snapshot of domestic economic activity, said the pace of growth continues to be modest to moderate. The report comes ahead of the Fed's next monetary policy meeting, during which the central bank is expected to keep short-term interest rates steady. February gold gcg8 was at $1,338.30 an ounce in electronic trading. Prices had gained $2.10, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,339.20 an ounce for the session, their highest since Sept. 8, according to FactSet data.
Roger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said the new cash injection would go some way to reassuring the worst affected businesses, but warned that the chancellor must remain wary of a spring cliff-edge in business support as the furlough program and other support measures unwind.
The payday lending industry's trade group, the Community Financial Services Association of America, didn't respond to requests for comment. Lenders World Acceptance Corp. WRLD, +1.06% and Enova International Inc. ENVA, -8.25% also didn't respond to requests for comment.
despite his recent challenges calling a top, grantham is worth paying attention to due to his prescient calls over the years. he said that stocks were overvalued in 2000 and again in 2007, anticipating those market downturns, the wall street journal reports. grantham also signaled that elements of the financial market had become unmoored from reality leading up to the 2008-09 financial crisis.
And we've seen the tax plan mentioned directly that companies now feel more comfortable about the economic position they're in, they feel better about the U.S. economy, they feel more confident about their earnings, and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees. So I think there's a 100% correlation between what we've seen these almost close to 200 companies do and what we have done from a regulatory standpoint and more on a tax policy standpoint.
Ahead of the U.S. presidential inauguration, investors are positioned for stronger growth and inflation, but are not willing to turn fully bullish with China-related risks on the horizon, said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist, in a press release accompanying the survey.
So far, Rouhani has been unwilling or unable to use the power of the presidency to reform Iran. But, amid the protests, he is more motivated than ever to improve domestic economic conditions. Should he fail, Iran may face a larger wave of protests, with stronger leadership and clearer objectives.
The agency fined Wells Fargo WFC, +2.43% $100 million in September 2016 for alleged illegal practices including opening as many as two million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' knowledge.

The new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.
No perks for some fired government workers
Also, the report noted, many households of color are dealing with debt issues. Student loan debt typically haunts students of color for much longer than other students, it said. Households of color are also more likely to be turned down for loans and are more vulnerable to fees and predatory products than white households.
Profit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans from government or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helping entrepreneurs in developing nations.
Money managers and investors are hoping for the best when it comes to President-elect Donald Trump's potential to bring strong growth and inflation to the U.S. and abroad, but that doesn't mean they're ready to shift into full bull mode yet.

Pacific Community Ventures is a San Francisco-based community development lender that offers loans of between $10,000 and $200,000 to small businesses in California. You need to have been in business at least a year and have at least two employees. However, if you have a solid business record and a firm grasp of your business finances, PCV may offer you a loan even if you fall short on some requirements.
California-based Opportunity Fund has been serving residents of the state since 1994, with more than $160 million in microloans. Its borrowers have a median household income of $31,000 a year. Around 90% are minority-owned businesses, and about 30% are women-owned businesses. Opportunity Fund also provides financial literacy education to business owners.

If you apply a ratio derived from an employer survey, to one derived from employee data (yes, yes, that's not terrific practice), you arrive at an average annual bonus of $1,426.
There is incredible uncertainty relating to the TSA, and as that relates to air travel and tourism, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research and Trading, referring to reports of longer lines at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints as agents who aren't getting paid call out sick. (In the wake of such reports, the TSA said 90% of U.S. passengers waited less than 15 minutes on Sunday, while a big pilots union has called for an end to the shutdown because it's hurting safety and efficiency.)
Gold has moved into recovery mode, a move which coincides with the dollar moving into correction. I had been skeptical of the late December rally, however, each day this week the gold price has been pulling higher and the recovery is gathering pace, said Richard Perry, market analyst at Hantec Markets, in a note.
The Fed has penciled in two rate hikes in 2019, down from three hikes projected in September.
The first item is to look at what companies have said. The Grover Norquist-led Americans for Tax Reform has been keeping an exhaustive list, relying not just on press releases but also news stories and reader submissions. The benefit of using this list is also that it's the most generous tabulation — this is an organization that was wildly enthusiastic about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Whether Rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely — indeed, perhaps not for very much longer. Iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship. But, thanks partly to persistent corruption — Iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area — annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%. According to Gallup, only citizens of Iraq and South Sudan are more pessimistic about their future.
The incentives in the 2017 tax cut had almost nothing to do with the investment boom we saw in 2017 and 2018, which helps explain why many corporate executives and macro-economists don't think the tax cut transformed the economy at all.
Banks taking a harder look at the use of debt to buy digital assets come as bitcoin and its rivals have ballooned in popularity in recent months. The fervor around virtual coins has been compared with tulip mania, with as prominent a banker as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s CEO Jamie Dimon at one point describing the craze over bitcoin and its brethren as a fraud and speculative bubble that will end badly. A call to J.P. Morgan about its credit-card policy toward bitcoin weren't immediately returned.
The World Happiness Report was released in March 2017 and involved polling of 1,000 residents per country by research organization Gallup, and was put together by SDSN, a group linked to the United Nations and led in part by economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, known for The End of Poverty and other books. Where necessary, Gallup seeks the permissions of national, regional, and local governments. The interviews are conducted by phone and face-to-face.
It should not have come as a surprise when protesters shouted, Let go of Syria; think about us.
The database contains hundreds of thousands of complaints filed by consumers about issues ranging from predatory debt collectors to errors on credit reports.

Several Fed officials noted that a faster pace of rate increases could also have implications for the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
On Tuesday, residents were out in force in the county, where MarketWatch visited two polling locations.
Moreover, the protesters are essentially leaderless and lack clear objectives. No matter how much encouragement Western powers give them, the protests seem all but certain to end with Islamist hardliners retaining their power bases and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps retaining control of most of the state's assets and security activities.

Excelsior Growth Fund offers online loans of up to $100,000 for approved borrowers in less than five days and funding of up to $500,000 through its ImpactLoan program. The lender deals with borrowers who typically wouldn't qualify for traditional financing because their company is a startup or has poor credit. Through affiliates, it also provides SBA 7(a) and Community Advantage loans.
Surveys of manufacturing executives show that the giddy optimism of early 2018 has turned to caution. The new orders component of the ISM manufacturing index, for instance, plunged 11 points in December. Company guidance, U.S. regional surveys and global purchasing managers surveys are telling the same story: Companies are scaling back their plans for capital spending.
SolarCity said Wednesday it is eliminating more than 550 jobs in Nevada as it continues a campaign against new, government-mandated solar metering rates.
Any effort to reform Iran's economy must recognize the costly absurdity of the country's expansionist foreign policies. Funding a proxy war in Yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in Lebanon, and seeking to dominate Syria and Iraq cost billions of dollars annually.
Some airlines have voiced concerns about delays in the certification of new aircraft and slowdowns in the training of pilots and air traffic controllers, said Clayton Allen, a Height Capital Markets analyst.
Tight contests are expected as Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Warnock are facing off against Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. If the Republicans win just one of the seats, they'll remain in the Senate majority and put a check on the agenda of Biden and the Democratic-run House of Representatives.
About 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or working without wages thanks to the shutdown, now in its 21th day. They are missing out on paychecks for the first time on Friday, which otherwise generally would have been payday.

A 100% correlation? Here's a look at what the companies have said and what they've done.
Gold settled higher on Wednesday, as a benchmark dollar index dropped to a three-month low. Prices for the precious metal then extended gains into electronic trading shortly after minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting revealed that some Federal Reserve members wanted to hold policy steady in December. The news put even more pressure on the dollar. February gold gcg9 traded at $1,293 an ounce, after settling on Comex at $1,292, up $6.10, or 0.5% for the session.

The new one-off grants come in addition to billions of existing business support, including grants worth up to £3,000 for closed businesses, and up to £2,100 a month for impacted businesses once they reopen.
Still, the CFPB's payday lending rules were complex, amounting to more than 1,000 pages, said Nick Clements, the co-founder of personal finance company MagnifyMoney, who previously worked in the credit industry. Although payday lenders can indeed cause borrowers financial distress, I do think there are some fair criticisms of the CFPB in terms of excessive complexity, he said.
Cost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like Texas and Florida, Sonn said. This will put thousands more in the pockets of struggling workers who right now are often going into debt and just aren't able to afford the basics.
the most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears, he writes.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak on Tuesday unveiled a fresh £4.6 billion ($6.2 billion) support package for struggling U.K. businesses, just hours after the government imposed a third lockdown in the country to curb a rapid rise in coronavirus cases.
Now that you're nearing (or past) retirement, you think, I may move to a gated community.
The U.S. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. The tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. Maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.

Like many of us, the Fed has no clear idea yet of what exactly is going to be implemented and to what extent it will impact economic growth, employment and inflation, said FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed, in an emailed note. However, it has become obvious that the increase of expected interest-rate hikes in 2017 from two to three was largely based on the unknown.
They argued that weak inflation readings allowed th central bank some latitude to wait and see how the data developed in light of the rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty over the global economic outlook, the minutes show.
That's not really a positive for financial markets SPX, -0.16% , because not having a regulator in your office doesn't mean you can run hog wild. It just means you can't get sign-off on things, Allen said. I kind of struggle to find people who are winning in this scenario, from a corporate perspective.
The yield on the 2-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , sensitive to changes in monetary policy expectations, rose 2.9 basis points to 2.001%, its highest finish since September. 2008. That contributed to a 4.1 basis point climb this week.

Data compiled by the Pew Research Center show that between the 2011 earmark ban and fiscal 2018, only one individual appropriations bill was enacted, rather than the 84 appropriations bills Congress should have passed. Individual appropriations bills have fared just as poorly in more recent years.
The U.S. gained 304,000 new jobs in January, although hiring at the end of 2018 wasn't as strong as originally reported. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from 3.9% and the 12-month rate of hourly wage gains dipped to 3.2% from a revised 3.3% in the prior three months that marked a post-recession high.
Experts say the divisive political climate in the U.S. likely hasn't helped. The United States can and should raise happiness by addressing America's multi-faceted social crisis — rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust — rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth, especially since the concrete proposals along these lines would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the deepening social crisis, the report added.
There are three broad classes of fixed investment: structures, such as factories, oil wells and housing; equipment, such as machinery, airplanes and computers; and intellectual property, such as software, new drugs, and blockbuster Hollywood movies.

The temporary head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has announced a new plan for the agency that seems to confirm the fears of consumer advocates.
Here's what is real — what companies are giving to investors. According to data from TrimTabs, 23 companies have announced stock buybacks worth a cumulative $33.8 billion since the tax cuts became law, and the firm expects announcements to pick up as more companies report earnings in coming weeks.
First, Iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (That commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between Russia and Iran.) Second — and more dangerous — Iran's leaders believe that they have a God-given right to unite Shia Muslims under a single caliphate. The result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.
Alexander Arnon of the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated in a blog post titled The Price of Oil is Now a Key Driver of Business Investment that firmer oil prices accounted for almost all of the growth in investment in 2018.
Business leaders welcomed the support package, but warned that on its own, the support wasn't enough to keep businesses afloat longer term.
Nevada's public commission said late last month that solar-panel users would get paid for their energy at lower, wholesale rates instead of at the higher, retail rates they had previously received. The commission also ordered public utility NV Energy to increase the monthly service charge for solar-panel users.
Roger Barker, director of policy and corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said the new cash injection would go some way to reassuring the worst affected businesses, but warned that the chancellor must remain wary of a spring cliff-edge in business support as the furlough program and other support measures unwind.
The 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard reviewed 115 outcome and policy measures for all 50 states and the District of Columbia to see how well residents are faring in five categories, and how much progress each state has made in adopting policies in them toward building a path to prosperity for all its residents. The categories: financial assets and income; businesses and jobs; homeownership and housing; health care and education.
Although the median net worth has been rising more for people of color than for whites, the unemployment rate is still more than twice as high for blacks (7.7%) than for whites (3.5%).
Whether Rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely — indeed, perhaps not for very much longer. Iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship. But, thanks partly to persistent corruption — Iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area — annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%. According to Gallup, only citizens of Iraq and South Sudan are more pessimistic about their future.
A few things become clear when looking at the list. One is that, generally, the companies are making one-time payments, typically on the order of $1,000 per non-executive employee. A notable minority also mention lifting their minimum wage to $15 per hour.
Businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be able to claim up to £9,000 ($12,235) in one-off grants to help them cope with the latest restrictions, which were announced late on Monday night by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The fact is, however, that the companies making these announcements are typically in highly regulated industries. AT&T, which has been trying to win support for its Time Warner US:TWX merger, kicked off these announcements, and it is mostly banks, from giants like Bank of America BAC, +2.61% to lesser-known lenders like Bank of Advance and Flushing Financial Corp., FFIC, +0.62% announcing them. Several utilities have additionally announced planned rate cuts.
Aside from its signature 7(a) term loans, the SBA issues low-cost small-business financing through a network of nonprofits.
Federal Reserve officials saw the possibility that they might have to raise interest rates faster than the gradual pace that they have stressed for some time, according to minutes of the December meeting released Wednesday.
Also, the report noted, many households of color are dealing with debt issues. Student loan debt typically haunts students of color for much longer than other students, it said. Households of color are also more likely to be turned down for loans and are more vulnerable to fees and predatory products than white households.
Experts say the divisive political climate in the U.S. likely hasn't helped. The United States can and should raise happiness by addressing America's multi-faceted social crisis — rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust — rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth, especially since the concrete proposals along these lines would exacerbate rather than ameliorate the deepening social crisis, the report added.
But that doesn't mean that nothing will change. Nor does it mean that the West has no leverage to exercise.
At a polling station at a Salvation Army on Bee Road in Savannah, election official Sharon Chisholm was watching a steady stream of voters and observed that the whole nation has its eyes on Georgia.
No perks for some fired government workers
International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.62% said Tuesday that it has appointed Gary Cohn to serve as vice chairman of its board of directors. Cohn will also join the company's executive leadership team. Cohn served as assistant for economic policy to President Donald Trump and director of the National Economic Council from January 2017 to April 2018. He previously worked as the president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.95% . In a release, Cohn cheered IBM's focused growth strategy that will capitalize on the enormous opportunity in hybrid cloud and AI. IBM shares are up 0.7% in Tuesday morning trading. They've gained 3.1% over the past three months as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% has risen 9.7%.

The commission also ordered public utility NV Energy to increase the monthly service charge for solar-panel users.
The biggest risk was that the unemployment rate might drop sharply below the 4.5% jobless rate viewed as the longer-run normal level below which might spark inflation.
A few Fed officials were also against a December interest rate increase, the minutes show, although the voting members of the FOMC decided to push ahead with an interest-rate hike.
You can learn responsibility in any job, if you take it seriously... It's different from what you learn in school.

Attempts to reach Capital One for comment were not immediately successful.
But producing oil from shale is different in an important way: The investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. This means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.

The Aspen Institute's FIELD program runs the U.S. Microenterprise Census, which collects data from microlenders across the country. Here are the top five microlenders by total loan amount disbursed, according to the program's 2014 survey, the most recent data available.
It used to be that changes in oil prices mainly affected consumption — lower prices boosted the economy by making energy consumers richer, while higher prices frequently led to recessions. But since the fracking revolution earlier in this decade, changes in oil prices have become highly correlated with changes in investment.
In addition, the majority party gets disproportionately more earmarks than the minority, although the minority gets enough to make it harder for them to use earmarks as a campaign issue.
the s&p 500 spx, +0.29% and the dow jones industrial average djia, +0.58% posted impressive gains in 2020, despite an initial bear market a decline of at least 20% and a recovery from those march lows of over 60%, while the nasdaq composite index comp, +0.40% surged more than 80% from its nadir.

For many of them, this is the last time they're going to buy a home, said Michelle Ames, a real-estate broker in Frisco, Texas. They're looking to shelter in place, and they want to do it with lots of like-minded people.
It was so important to get over here and do this today, Robertson, 68, told MarketWatch in an Election Day interview outside a polling station in Chatham County on Tuesday.
Most recently a single bitcoin was trading at $10,975, off 3.7%, according to research and data site Coindesk.com, while futures on the Cboe US:XBTG8 for February were off 2.4% at $10,930 and January CME futures US:BTCF8 were down 2.1% at $10,880.
But those same people indicated they would in theory support an agency like the CFPB, if they knew it existed. Some 80% of respondents in the CreditCards.com survey said they were in favor of having a federal government agency whose goal is to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and take action against companies who break the law. The irony? That description CreditCards.com took from the CFPB's mission statement, without naming the agency.
Gold prices gave up earlier lows on Wednesday to end higher for a fifth session, then eased back in electronic trading from their settlement shortly after the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book. The report, which offers a snapshot of domestic economic activity, said the pace of growth continues to be modest to moderate. The report comes ahead of the Fed's next monetary policy meeting, during which the central bank is expected to keep short-term interest rates steady. February gold gcg8 was at $1,338.30 an ounce in electronic trading. Prices had gained $2.10, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,339.20 an ounce for the session, their highest since Sept. 8, according to FactSet data.

In a gated community near me, a minivan was stolen out of a driveway when the thieves got in through a hole in a fence, Ames said. Unless you want to put concertina wire along the top of your wall, you can't be totally secure.
Currently, the CFPB can issue a civil investigative demand when it needs to gather information, but that investigative process can be costly for companies, Jacquot said. State attorneys general can also enforce those laws, which can create costly investigations in their home states.
AT&T T, -0.46% , for instance, had already agreed to the bonus in talks with its union, when it made its announcement on Dec. 20. That said, the Communications Workers of America told ThinkProgress — a website of a left-wing policy group — that AT&T agreed to the bonuses after the CWA argued employees should get the $4,000 wage increase that the White House promised the tax cut would provide. That actually argues in favor of the Cohn point — the tax cuts led to an economic environment resulting in increased pay for workers.
Many Fed officials judged the risk of a sizable undershooting of the normal jobless rate had increased somewhat and that the Federal Open Market Committee might need to raise the federal-funds rate more quickly than currently anticipated to limit the degree of undershooting and stem a potential buildup of inflationary pressures, according to the minutes.
Empire State Certified Development Corp. is part of the New York Business Development Corp., a major SBA lender. It was the top SBA Community Advantage lender in 2014. Empire State CDC also participates in the SBA commercial loan program.
For instance, IHS Markit is predicting that U.S. gross domestic product will fade from 2.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2023. The Federal Reserve, the Congressional Budget Office, the IMF and other forecasters agree that the tax cut was a temporary jolt, not a game-changer.
The banking sector might be particular wary of bitcoin because digital assets, many of which run on decentralized, distributed-ledger technologies, have been associated with money laundering and criminal activity.
The gains came after minutes from the central bank's Dec. 13-14 meeting out Wednesday showed Fed officials are grappling with considerable uncertainty about the possible impact on the U.S. economy of President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus plans.
Although the Senate has appeared more committed to its ban, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and other Senate Republicans and Democrats are also receptive to reviving earmarking.
Fifty-six-year-old Herbert Chaplin got to Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and said he wanted to make sure he cast his ballot before it was too late.
Before 2011, earmarks were regularly and – until 2007 – in increasingly large numbers inserted into appropriations and highway funding bills.
It is possible, for example, that Rouhani will end up stepping down, whether by force or choice.
April platinum US:PLJ7 rose $28.80, or 3%, to $976 an ounce, while March palladium US:PAH7 shed 60 cents, or less th an 0.1%, to $738.20 an ounce. March copper US:HGH7 lost 1.9 cents, or 0.7%, to $2.538 a pound.
Fed officials pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different path of policy than the currently expected, the minutes said.
Several Fed voting members noted that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than expected, it might become necessary to adjust the FOMC's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate, consistent with the possibility that a less gradual pace of increases could become appropriate, the minutes said.
One example: low-income people are ineligible for federal programs such as SNAP (food stamps) and TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) if they amass even modest savings, the report noted. Prosperity Now calls policies like this a roadblock on the path to saving.

My own research shows that between 1994 and 2000, as Congress went from Democratic to Republican control, earmarks, once highly effective in inducing members to vote for appropriations bills, became gradually less so.
Any effort to reform Iran's economy must recognize the costly absurdity of the country's expansionist foreign policies. Funding a proxy war in Yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in Lebanon, and seeking to dominate Syria and Iraq cost billions of dollars annually.
Weidrich concedes that there's been an incremental improvement in a lot of economic measures compared to a year ago. In addition to the falling unemployment rate (just 3% for people 55+), there are the rising stock market (until the past few days), increasing wages — up 2.9% in the past year — rising median net worth and a drop in the number of Americans without health insurance (something which may change with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act mandate).
What is a microloan, and is one right for your small business?
Here's a chart that lays out how global fund managers' positions have changed in the latest month.
Justine Petersen, which is based in St. Louis, offers small-business loans, typically of less than $10,000. The nonprofit also finances businesses in rural areas through the U.S. Department of Agriculture Intermediary Relending Program and originates loans of up to $150,000 as part of the SBA's Community Advantage Program.

Norway was also No. 1 out of 155 countries on the 2017 World Happiness Report, up from No. 4 the year before, followed by Denmark (last year's No. 1), Iceland and Switzerland. The U.S. was trailing at No. 14. These four countries rank highly on all the main factors found to support happiness: caring, freedom, generosity, honesty, health, income and good governance. Their averages are so close that small changes can re-order the rankings from year to year, the report said.

Sweden ranked No. 2 and Canada was No. 3, followed by Australia, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria. The U.S. ranked No. 19 just behind the Czech Republic, Japan and France. Afghanistan ranked last at No. 98.
But, if that is the case, they failed to anticipate the depth of the dissatisfaction of the Iranian people with the status quo — especially their own role in it.
Moreover, the protesters are essentially leaderless and lack clear objectives. No matter how much encouragement Western powers give them, the protests seem all but certain to end with Islamist hardliners retaining their power bases and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps retaining control of most of the state's assets and security activities.
Check out how these seven went from small potatoes to success stories.
The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business, it said. America's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis… Almost all of the policy discourse in Washington, D.C. centers on naïve attempts to raise the economic growth rate, as if a higher growth rate would somehow heal the deepening divisions and angst in American society. This kind of growth-only agenda is doubly wrong-headed.

For the most part, the shutdown is a drag on big and small companies, according to Collender. He said: You see mostly losers here. Coffee shops, taxi businesses and other companies that serve government employees could be cutting their staffing, and small firms that provide things like office supplies are losing business and not likely to recoup it, the budget expert said.
The FOMC minutes has made the dollar bulls wary, said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets. The risk of a blowout is really high and the dollar index moved too fast and too quick.
But employers are directing these bonuses to workers who aren't typically receiving them. Employers have been paying out bonuses equal to 4.7% of wages and salaries for management, professional and related fields, but just 0.8% for service employees. The announcements make clear the bonuses are for the rank and file, not management.
For example, Hawaii, Montana and South Carolina established state earned income tax credits; California and Illinois expanded their credits to cover more working families. These tax credits, like the federal anti-poverty one, put money in the pockets of low- and moderate-income working people so they can keep more of what they earn. Currently, 29 states have a state earned income tax credit.
Unfortunately, oil prices have fallen again. Oil prices, which were near $70 in October, fell to $43 in mid-December and are now around $52. That's right at the midpoint of profitability for most fracking projects, according to the Dallas Fed's Energy Survey.

Money managers polled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the long-dollar trade is by far the most crowded right now:
Such offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown Americans often have low levels of savings. Big banks including Wells Fargo WFC, -0.88% and Bank of America BAC, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a New York Times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. Pro baseball is getting involved, as the Washington Nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.
Although the median net worth has been rising more for people of color than for whites, the unemployment rate is still more than twice as high for blacks (7.7%) than for whites (3.5%).
By a unanimous vote on Dec. 14, the Fed raised its federal-funds range by a quarter-percentage point to 0.50%-0.75%, its second rate increase in a decade. At the same time, Fed officials said economic conditions will warrant only gradual increases in the federal-funds rate. In the so-called dot plot, Fed officials penciled in three quarter-point rate increases in 2017 instead of two seen in September.
Higher interest rates can be a negative for gold, which tends to benefit from looser monetary policy. But the minutes also sent the dollar DXY, +0.41% sharply lower and as the greenback extended its decline Thursday, it offered dollar-denominated gold some support.

And, although the Trump administration and Congress recently made it tougher for states to set up retirement plans for residents whose employers don't offer them — a short-sighted policy, Weidrich said — a few states are creating them anyway.
last year was a remarkable year for risk assets in the face of a global viral epidemic that left equity indexes initially reeling in the spring, only to stage a spectacular rebound in the ensuing months as fiscal and monetary policy contributed to an economic recovery.

This report was first published on Jan. 8, 2019.
Irregular bonuses may provide a more meaningful lift to fourth-quarter compensation per hour, but it will likely also be offset by potential individual income shifting. More significant effects from tax reform seem more likely in the next few quarters via a tighter labor market.

Money managers polled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch said the long-dollar trade is by far the most crowded right now:
That should be read as the average bonus every worker is receiving. Some obviously get nothing, while some make thousands more. Nearly 40% of private-sector workers are eligible for a bonus, but some smaller percentage actually get them.
These differences could help explain why, in my research, earmarks provided leaders with less leverage over members' votes in Republican-controlled congresses.
While earmarks have been condemned as frivolous at best and corrupt at worst, research on their uses and effects paints a more complex picture of their dynamics. My own research, as well as that of Frances Lee, shows that such projects helped transportation committee leaders pass three massive highway bills, overcoming significant policy controversies.
Gold futures rallied Thursday to finish at a five-week high as the dollar continued to slide after minutes from the Federal Reserve's December meeting unsettled investors' expectations about the pace of interest-rate rises.
The U.S. gained 304,000 new jobs in January, although hiring at the end of 2018 wasn't as strong as originally reported. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4% from 3.9% and the 12-month rate of hourly wage gains dipped to 3.2% from a revised 3.3% in the prior three months that marked a post-recession high.
But overspending is in the eye of the beholder. At their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (Discretionary spending is money over which Congress has direct control, unlike Social Security or Medicare, for example.) As a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that Democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.
When considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions.
In reality, however, the Prosperity Now report said, the dominant narrative about low-wealth people is nothing but a series of myths. Poor choices, the analysts there say, aren't why people are poor.
Trump complained in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last Friday that the Chinese yuan USDCNY, had become too weak and the dollar too strong, saying U.S. companies can't compete with China due to that currency imbalance. The comments weighed on the dollar and stocks Tuesday.

The new strain of the virus presents us all with a huge challenge — and whilst the vaccine is being rolled out, we have needed to tighten restrictions further, Sunak said in a statement. This [support package] will help businesses to get through the months ahead — and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen, he added.
The federal minimum wage has been at $7.25 since July 2009. The Raise the Wage Act would only gradually lift that wage, reaching $15 per hour by 2024. It would then index future minimum wage increases to median wage growth. It would also phase out subminimum wages for tipped, youth and disabled workers.
The shutdown is disrupting the initial-public-offering process and may cause delays in some of the bigger IPOs expected in 2019. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which lobbies for big business in Washington, has called for an end to the closure, saying it's hearing every day from businesses across the country about how the adverse consequences of the shutdown are wide and growing.

Iran is at a turning point. The world must now send its regime a clear message: stop destabilizing the region and help your own people to prosper.
The current impetus among House Democrats also may be driven by their losses in the 2020 election. The Democrats' new majority is currently at 222, compared with 211 for the Republicans, with two seats still undecided.
There isn't a nice, neat average bonus figure readily available, but you can mix and match data to get to a very rough estimate. Labor Department data finds that, on a per-hour basis, employers paid out nonproduction bonuses equal to 3.2% of the wages and salaries per worker. Data released earlier this month shows the typical full-time worker made $857 per week, before bonuses.
This breakdown in the regular appropriations process coincides neatly with the earmark moratorium, although before the 2011 moratorium, the process did not always go smoothly.
The minutes of the Federal Reserve' December meeting showed a willingness to delay further interest rate hikes given the volatility in financial markets and concern about global growth, according to minutes of that meeting released Wednesday.
But if architectural conformity appeals to you and you're tired of skateboarding kids and baby-strolling moms clogging your street, an age-55 and over gated community might make sense. And if you don't enjoy hiring a gardener, mowing your lawn or cursing speeders who plague your neighborhood, then a gated community can deliver the peace and quiet you covet.
At 13, Buffett woke up every day at 4:30 a.m. to deliver copies of the Washington Post. But he was a far cry from your average paperboy, taking an ambitious approach to his route that hints at the incredible drive and savvy he wields now.
Now, following the 2020 election, House Democrats have apparently decided to return to the practice. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland announced on Nov. 20 that the Appropriations Committee would soon begin soliciting member requests for earmarks, with a focus on projects that would benefit nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.
The analysis was released by information-analytics firm LexisNexis Legal & Professional, a RELX Group RELX, -0.16% company, found that countries that have established a strong rule of law have significantly more success in securing measures of life, liberty and happiness for their citizens. Sweden ranked No. 2 and Canada was No. 3, followed by Australia, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria. The U.S. ranked No. 19 just behind the Czech Republic, Japan and France. Afghanistan ranked last at No. 98.
Now, hopes that the investment boom would continue into 2019 are in tatters, victim to four factors that are dragging on the economy: reduced fiscal stimulus (including the shutdown), a weakening global economy, the uncertainty of Donald Trump's trade policy and soft oil prices.
Currently, the CFPB can issue a civil investigative demand when it needs to gather information, but that investigative process can be costly for companies, Jacquot said. State attorneys general can also enforce those laws, which can create costly investigations in their home states.

All in all, many participants emphasized that the greater uncertainties about these policies made it more challenging to communicate to the public about the likely path of the federal funds rate, the minutes said.
That one vote I cast is going to count, and I make sure since I was 18 years old that I always get my vote in, said the Democrat. Outside the church, a DJ was playing a mixture of hip-hop and R&B.

Earlier this week, a separate report examined mortality for the U.S. and other wealthy nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for children from birth to age 19 from 1961 to 2010. From 2001 to 2010 the risk of death in the U.S. was 76% greater for infants and 57% greater for children ages 1 to 19, according to the study, Child Mortality In The US And 19 OECD Comparator Nations: A 50-Year Time-Trend Analysis, published in Health Affairs journal.
Another staffer blamed the failure of leaders to punish disloyal members by removing their earmarks.
In his State of the Union address, President Trump said there has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. But the new 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its accompanying report says that isn't so for low-income Americans.
Irregular bonuses may provide a more meaningful lift to fourth-quarter compensation per hour, but it will likely also be offset by potential individual income shifting. More significant effects from tax reform seem more likely in the next few quarters via a tighter labor market.

Congressional earmarks – otherwise known as pork barrel spending – may be coming back.
From a financial standpoint, you'll want to consider the monthly dues, what they cover and whether they're likely to go up. Well-run homeowner associations maintain fully funded reserves rather than relying on steep assessments from time to time to cover deferred maintenance and other costs.

The minutes also show some talk of slowing down the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet. At the moment, the Fed is letting $50 billion of maturing securities run off the balance sheet each month.
Mulvaney's op-ed and recent statements have alarmed some consumer advocates. I don't think anybody in their right mind would say they believe consumers need less protecting, and who really needs help is banks, predators and financial bad actors, said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.
One of the things that is maybe not appreciable now, but will have an impact as time goes on, is the impact on air traffic control, he told MarketWatch. We have a shortage of air traffic controllers, so slowing down the training process today means that a year from now, six month from now, you're not going to have as many air traffic controllers as you thought you would.
At some point, the economy will encounter another downswing or recession and those who are not benefiting much from today's economic gains will be hardest hit, said Wiedrich.

The Japanese yen USDJPY, -0.01% strengthened against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda affirmed the central bank would continue to support the Japanese economy through monetary easing. Kuroda also said that inflation was finally getting close to the BOJ's target of 2% and that there would be a slight pickup in inflation expectations. Japan is understood to have the loosest approach to monetary policy among the developed economies, and is expected to be one of the last to join the trend of policy normalization. The dollar last bought ¥108.95, down from ¥109.41. The pair touched its lowest level since September on Thursday.
An Urban Institute study of 60 U.S. cities discovered that the predominately white areas had a median credit score 80 points higher than in predominately non-white neighborhoods, which can cost families of color $100 or more each month on a mortgage. And the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances found that African-American households are twice as likely as white household to be late on credit payments.
For decades, earmarks paid for pet projects back in lawmakers' districts, with the tacit aim to earn those lawmakers votes. In turn, the awards encouraged legislators to vote for large spending bills. They have long been seen by many members of the public as well as some lawmakers as wasteful and distasteful, and they were banned in 2011.
California's program, called CalSavers, will open to all eligible workers this July.

Norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. It is sometimes said that Norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, Norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.
The fact is, however, that the companies making these announcements are typically in highly regulated industries. AT&T, which has been trying to win support for its Time Warner US:TWX merger, kicked off these announcements, and it is mostly banks, from giants like Bank of America BAC, +2.61% to lesser-known lenders like Bank of Advance and Flushing Financial Corp., FFIC, +0.62% announcing them. Several utilities have additionally announced planned rate cuts.
Data compiled by the Pew Research Center show that between the 2011 earmark ban and fiscal 2018, only one individual appropriations bill was enacted, rather than the 84 appropriations bills Congress should have passed. Individual appropriations bills have fared just as poorly in more recent years.

My interviews with committee staff members suggested various reasons for this diminished effectiveness. Prominent among them, according to one staffer, was the fact that votes were increasingly … on highly charged substantive policy matters. Senators needed to vote on those issues in a partisan manner, regardless of earmarks.
In a gated community near me, a minivan was stolen out of a driveway when the thieves got in through a hole in a fence, Ames said. Unless you want to put concertina wire along the top of your wall, you can't be totally secure.
Illinois passed a law that bans government employees fired for misconduct from cashing in on severance pay. As part of Senate Bill 3604, misconduct refers to deliberate or careless actions that harm others or go against employer standards of behavior. It also includes chronic absenteeism, tardiness and criminal assault on another employee or customer. The law affects all government workers, as well as those who work for state colleges and universities and school districts. Under the law, any government worker fired for misconduct wouldn't be allowed to collect any severance pay.
This breakdown in the regular appropriations process coincides neatly with the earmark moratorium, although before the 2011 moratorium, the process did not always go smoothly.
First, Iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with Russian President Vladimir Putin. (That commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between Russia and Iran.) Second — and more dangerous — Iran's leaders believe that they have a God-given right to unite Shia Muslims under a single caliphate. The result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.
I'd ask, 'What do you think of living here?' and people really opened up, she recalled. They might complain about a special assessment added to their homeowner dues to pay for roof repairs or the restrictive policy regarding the type and number of dogs you could have.
All in all, Wiedrich said, Americans with low wealth generally aren't reaping the benefits of today's humming economy. Their wages aren't keeping up with the rising costs of housing and health care. Also, many are dealing with income volatility, which makes it hard to plan and to make ends meet, said Wiedrich.

 Iran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the Middle East. Amid the current protests, however, the West has a golden opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on domestic economic conditions. 
Some Fed officials saw this as a modest risk and said that a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate might help return inflation to the Fed's 2% target. But this seemed to be a minority view.
But other Fed officials were against tapering the pace of the run-off, saying they were worried it would be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of monetary policy.
Microloans disbursed in 2014: $17.7 million
Mulvaney wrote that the bureau previously believed we were the good guys and the financial-service industry was the bad guys, but that will change, he said.
It's important to define terms from the start. When economists talk about investment, they aren't talking about putting money into the stock market. They are talking about building and maintaining productive assets that will continue to create value for years.
The 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard and its report, Whose Bad Choices? How Policy Precludes Prosperity and What We Can Do About It, also make the argument that the U.S. economic system and policies of the Trump administration and Congress are stacked against people of color.

But those same people indicated they would in theory support an agency like the CFPB, if they knew it existed. Some 80% of respondents in the CreditCards.com survey said they were in favor of having a federal government agency whose goal is to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive practices and take action against companies who break the law. The irony? That description CreditCards.com took from the CFPB's mission statement, without naming the agency.

For example, Hawaii, Montana and South Carolina established state earned income tax credits; California and Illinois expanded their credits to cover more working families. These tax credits, like the federal anti-poverty one, put money in the pockets of low- and moderate-income working people so they can keep more of what they earn. Currently, 29 states have a state earned income tax credit.

To be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of Iran's government, appeals based on Iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. But if Rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back Iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. This would minimize the risk of severe violence in Iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.
Dennis Shaul, the CEO of the Community Financial Services Association of America, a trade group that includes payday lenders, said he was pleased.

The U.S. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. In 2007, it ranked No. 3 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. But it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. The predominant political discourse in the United States is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. But the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist Jeffrey Sachs wrote in the report.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Still-low inflation readings and signs that inflation might actually soften in the near term made the Federal Reserve's rate hike a close call for some officials, according to the minutes of the December 15-16 meeting, released Wednesday. Fed officials voted unanimously last month to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 but the minutes make clear that some were more reluctant to hike than others. Going forward, the central bankers agreed to add to the policy statement that they were watching actual and expected progress towards to 2% inflation target carefully because of their significant concern about still-low readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook. More generally, Fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside.

Powell 's remarks calmed markets who viewed the chairman as too upbeat at his press conference after the December rate hike.
The bureau already had $177 million in reserves, enough to cover the $145 million the bureau projected it would need during the second quarter, he said.

President Trump on Thursday reportedly used vulgar language to describe immigrants from Haiti and African countries and said the U.S. needed more immigrants from countries like Norway. On Friday, Trump denied using the word shithole countries, but said he used tough language. The president's reported comments were described as racist by Rupert Colville, the United Nations spokesman for human rights. Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years.

The ongoing shutdown has been sparked by a dispute over money for President Donald Trump's proposed wall at the Mexican border. The president on Wednesday left a negotiating session after clashing with top Democratic lawmakers, and Trump stated Thursday that he could declare a national emergency in order to build his wall if there's no deal with Democrats, saying probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. Analysts have noted the impact of the current shutdown is somewhat limited, because it's only affecting agencies that represent about 25% of total government spending.

For the most part, the shutdown is a drag on big and small companies, according to Collender. He said: You see mostly losers here. Coffee shops, taxi businesses and other companies that serve government employees could be cutting their staffing, and small firms that provide things like office supplies are losing business and not likely to recoup it, the budget expert said.

In January 2017, the CFPB sued Navient Corp., the largest servicer of federal and private student loans in the U.S., in connection with creating obstacles for borrowers to repay their debts. The attorneys general of Pennsylvania, Illinois and Washington have also sued Navient. (A spokeswoman for Navient said the cases are still pending and said no ruling has been made on the facts in any of those three states. She pointed to a lengthy company statement on the cases, which say that the allegations were unfounded.)

Beyond conventional payday lenders, some credit unions that serve government employees are offering loans to affected workers during the shutdown, and they're not necessarily charging the high interest that's usually associated with cash advances. The Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering to lend up to $6,000 to eligible members, saying there will be no fees or interest charges, while the Congressional Federal Credit Union will extend a line of credit with a 0% interest rate for 60 days.

The Navy Federal Credit Union, for example, is offering to lend up to $6,000 to eligible members, saying there will be no fees or interest charges, while the Congressional Federal Credit Union will extend a line of credit with a 0% interest rate for 60 days.
The aviation industry is hurt in particular because two key government entities that it must deal with are affected by the shutdown — the Homeland Security Department and the Federal Aviation Administration, Allen added.

The World Happiness Report was released in March 2017 and involved polling of 1,000 residents per country by research organization Gallup, and was put together by SDSN, a group linked to the United Nations and led in part by economist Jeffrey D. Sachs, known for The End of Poverty and other books. Where necessary, Gallup seeks the permissions of national, regional, and local governments. The interviews are conducted by phone and face-to-face.
AT&T T, -0.46% , for instance, had already agreed to the bonus in talks with its union, when it made its announcement on Dec. 20. That said, the Communications Workers of America told ThinkProgress — a website of a left-wing policy group — that AT&T agreed to the bonuses after the CWA argued employees should get the $4,000 wage increase that the White House promised the tax cut would provide. That actually argues in favor of the Cohn point — the tax cuts led to an economic environment resulting in increased pay for workers.
States that increased minimum wage at the beginning of the year include: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont and Washington.
To be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of Iran's government, appeals based on Iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. But if Rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back Iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. This would minimize the risk of severe violence in Iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.

Several Fed officials noted that a faster pace of rate increases could also have implications for the Fed's $4.5 trillion balance sheet.
Wiedrich said the states with the lowest Scorecard rankings typically have the highest rates of low-wage jobs, lower credit scores and households struggling with incomes. Also, she added, these states tend to have less of a safety net. As a result, a financial emergency may hit their residents harder.
The group's report cites a Tax Policy Center estimate that the new tax law will translate to a $51,140 tax cut for the wealthiest 1% of households, but families earning less than $25,000 in 2018 will see a mere $60 in tax savings. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) just took heat for tweeting about a Pennsylvania high-school secretary who was pleasantly surprised her paycheck rose $1.50 a week due to the tax cut.
Many states have already been lifting their minimum wages above the federal minimum. Some 5.3 million workers started receiving higher pay starting Jan. 1, according to an analysis released by the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
Vermont began its Remote Worker Grant Program, which reimburses workers who move to Vermont for expenses including relocation costs, computer software and broadband access. The program pays remote workers up to $5,000 every year, up to a total of $10,000, when they move to the state. Lawmakers created the program to help reverse the trend of an aging and declining population and to draw more tech workers.
It used to be that changes in oil prices mainly affected consumption — lower prices boosted the economy by making energy consumers richer, while higher prices frequently led to recessions. But since the fracking revolution earlier in this decade, changes in oil prices have become highly correlated with changes in investment.

We have committed to fulfill the bureau's statutory responsibilities, but go no further, he said in the new five-year strategic plan he unveiled Monday. He said it should serve as a bulwark against the misuse of our unparalleled powers. Mulvaney, who is also the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and other Republicans have frequently said the CFPB is too powerful.
With the backdrop of market turmoil and rising concerns about global growth many participants expressed the view that, especially in the environment of muted inflation pressures, the FOMC could afford to be patient about further policy firming, the minutes show.
A few things become clear when looking at the list. One is that, generally, the companies are making one-time payments, typically on the order of $1,000 per non-executive employee. A notable minority also mention lifting their minimum wage to $15 per hour.
Financial markets currently see no chance of a rate hike in 2019.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Still-low inflation readings and signs that inflation might actually soften in the near term made the Federal Reserve's rate hike a close call for some officials, according to the minutes of the December 15-16 meeting, released Wednesday. Fed officials voted unanimously last month to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 but the minutes make clear that some were more reluctant to hike than others. Going forward, the central bankers agreed to add to the policy statement that they were watching actual and expected progress towards to 2% inflation target carefully because of their significant concern about still-low readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook. More generally, Fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside.
Federal spending bills normally allocate an amount of money for general purposes and often defer to federal agency officials or state leaders to determine which particular projects best meet the overall goals. Earmarks are specific congressional instructions that carve out some of those funds, declaring directly that X amount of money must be spent on Y project.
Why should you care about the change in direction?
All in all, Wiedrich said, Americans with low wealth generally aren't reaping the benefits of today's humming economy. Their wages aren't keeping up with the rising costs of housing and health care. Also, many are dealing with income volatility, which makes it hard to plan and to make ends meet, said Wiedrich.

It's important to define terms from the start. When economists talk about investment, they aren't talking about putting money into the stock market. They are talking about building and maintaining productive assets that will continue to create value for years.
When it comes to a trade war, many regard Trump as a risk. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping lauded globalization and said no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. It wouldn't be far fetched to imagine those comments were made in response to promises from Trump to slap tariffs on Chinese goods to lift U.S. manufacturing.
The price of a single bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 last December but has since cooled considerably amid a wave of heightened scrutiny from regulators in Asia and a domestic intent to tamp down speculation. Bitcoin has lost about half its value since its peak last year but is still up 1,025% since the end of 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up 34% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% has gained 27% over the period.
The Fed is surely betting that Donald Trump will be able to deliver when it comes to fiscal spending and tax reforms, but the reality may be far off what the market is positioned for, he said.

Gold prices bounced back from earlier losses on Friday to finish modestly higher. The precious metal stretched its streak of gains to an eleventh session and tallied a weekly gain of roughly 1% as some downbeat U.S. economic data helped feed expectations for a slower Federal Reserve interest-rate hike policy. February gold gcg8 rose 70 cents, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,322.30 an ounce, marking another finish at the highest level since mid-September. The weekly gain was also gold's fourth such rise in a row.

But that's not good news for consumers, especially low-income households who often turn to payday lenders who have charged interest rates of up to 400%, Frisch said.

The latest plan shows Mulvaney is clearly working from the outside and the inside to destroy the CFPB and cripple its ability to protect consumers from financial predators, said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.
San Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. The microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit and more likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. LiftFund got a boost in October 2016 when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced almost $5 million in funding for its new small-business loan program in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.
Prosperity Now argues that the 2017 tax law and a wave of deregulation by the Trump administration and Congress are helping the wealthiest Americans and corporations far more than people with low incomes.
In January, Mulvaney requested zero dollars in his second-quarter budget request and said the agency has enough money for now.

This year's Scorecard found that nearly one in four jobs are in low-wage occupations — ones that don't pay enough to keep families above the federal poverty line. And, Prosperity Now's researchers say, even though unemployment has been cut in half since its peak in 2010 (from 9.6% to 4.5%), the rate of low-wage jobs has decreased by just two percentage points since 2013 (to 25.6%) and is still higher than in 2010 (when the rate was 21.5%).
There are three specific risks that investors and money managers are or should be worried about, according to the January survey: trade war/protectionism (29%), U.S. policy error (24%) or a China yuan devaluation (15%), said the bank. Here's a chart showing how those risks stack up to other concerns:

U.S. criticized for inequality and cuts in welfare
Norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. It is sometimes said that Norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. By choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, Norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.
Maybe that's why he made traffic policy a hallmark pursuit as a politician. The MetroCard mayor pledged to commute to work via mass transit, promoted bike lanes and a bike-share program in NYC and created exclusive high-speed bus lanes. More recently, Bloomberg has emerged as a champion for global road safety, dedicating $250 million from his charitable foundation to improve conditions and promote bike and mass transit use around the world.
The gains came after minutes from the central bank's Dec. 13-14 meeting out Wednesday showed Fed officials are grappling with considerable uncertainty about the possible impact on the U.S. economy of President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal stimulus plans.
Tight contests are expected as Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Warnock are facing off against Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. If the Republicans win just one of the seats, they'll remain in the Senate majority and put a check on the agenda of Biden and the Democratic-run House of Representatives.
Traditional oil production is based on long-lasting projects requiring huge investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. The analysis of the profitability of, say, an offshore drilling project doesn't depend on spot crude oil prices US:CLG9, but on prices expected for the duration of the project's life. Temporary fluctuations in oil prices won't affect this kind of investment.
It was too early to know what President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy might entail, and how this might alter the economic outlook, Fed members said.

Thursday marks gold's seventh advance in eight sessions. Prices appear to be staging a mini rally in the wake of a downtrend in December that was sparked by expectations that Trump will enact policies that may be bullish for stocks but less favorable to assets considered as havens, such as gold.
A retirement crisis is looming in the country. Americans are not saving enough for their futures and in many cases, don't have access to a workplace retirement account to start. States have taken it upon themselves to implement retirement plans, and in some cases, require companies to offer a retirement plan if they have no alternatives in place.

The #MeToo movement, originally sparked by high-profile cases of sexual misconduct in Hollywood, quickly spread to other industries and has changed America's workplaces. Companies and policymakers are looking for solutions, Emily Martin, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women's Law Center, told MarketWatch last year. We've worked with so many more state legislators in 2018 on the issue of harassment in the workplace than we had in years, she said.

The 2018 Prosperity Now Scorecard reviewed 115 outcome and policy measures for all 50 states and the District of Columbia to see how well residents are faring in five categories, and how much progress each state has made in adopting policies in them toward building a path to prosperity for all its residents. The categories: financial assets and income; businesses and jobs; homeownership and housing; health care and education.
On Tuesday, residents were out in force in the county, where MarketWatch visited two polling locations.
And we've seen the tax plan mentioned directly that companies now feel more comfortable about the economic position they're in, they feel better about the U.S. economy, they feel more confident about their earnings, and they feel like the lower tax rate allows them to share more of their potential earnings with their employees. So I think there's a 100% correlation between what we've seen these almost close to 200 companies do and what we have done from a regulatory standpoint and more on a tax policy standpoint.

Those four interrelated trends are weighing on aggregate demand in the U.S. and global economies, forcing companies to scale back their investment plans. It's already visible in the data and in surveys of business expectations.
Like many of us, the Fed has no clear idea yet of what exactly is going to be implemented and to what extent it will impact economic growth, employment and inflation, said FXTM Chief Market Strategist Hussein Sayed, in an emailed note. However, it has become obvious that the increase of expected interest-rate hikes in 2017 from two to three was largely based on the unknown.
But student loan debt is a growing problem: Median student loan debt increased by 21.4% between 2010 and 2017, from $14,588 to $17,711. The percentage of student loan borrowers who are delinquent (15.8%) is nearly twice the percentage of delinquent credit card borrowers. Among those over 55 with student loan debt, 12.3% are severely delinquent.
Though betting markets and polls gave the edge to Democrats on the eve of the runoffs, not all observers are convinced.
It's possible that tax-preparation companies could see more demand for refund-advance loans, Collender said. The shutdown has threatened to delay the actual refunds, though the Trump administration said Monday that they would go out as usual.
There isn't a nice, neat average bonus figure readily available, but you can mix and match data to get to a very rough estimate. Labor Department data finds that, on a per-hour basis, employers paid out nonproduction bonuses equal to 3.2% of the wages and salaries per worker. Data released earlier this month shows the typical full-time worker made $857 per week, before bonuses.

Treasurys weakened Friday, pushing the two-year yield above 2%, after a larger-than-expected rise in a key consumer-price measure underlined rising inflation expectations and dampened appetite for U.S. government paper.
Ahead of the U.S. presidential inauguration, investors are positioned for stronger growth and inflation, but are not willing to turn fully bullish with China-related risks on the horizon, said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist, in a press release accompanying the survey.
Still, the CFPB's payday lending rules were complex, amounting to more than 1,000 pages, said Nick Clements, the co-founder of personal finance company MagnifyMoney, who previously worked in the credit industry. Although payday lenders can indeed cause borrowers financial distress, I do think there are some fair criticisms of the CFPB in terms of excessive complexity, he said.
Surveys of manufacturing executives show that the giddy optimism of early 2018 has turned to caution. The new orders component of the ISM manufacturing index, for instance, plunged 11 points in December. Company guidance, U.S. regional surveys and global purchasing managers surveys are telling the same story: Companies are scaling back their plans for capital spending.

The SBA Microloan Program offers loans of up to $50,000 administered through community-based nonprofit groups. The SBA Community Advantage Program offers loans of up to $250,000 in communities that historically have had limited access to capital. The federal agency guarantees up to 85% of Community Advantage financing.
Nonprofit microlenders are also grappling with a major trend in small-business financing: the rapid rise of online lending. It offers quicker but usually more expensive access to cash, says Steven Cohen, president of Excelsior Growth Fund, a New York-based community development lender.

Although the Senate has appeared more committed to its ban, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and other Senate Republicans and Democrats are also receptive to reviving earmarking.
The current impetus among House Democrats also may be driven by their losses in the 2020 election. The Democrats' new majority is currently at 222, compared with 211 for the Republicans, with two seats still undecided.
LONDON (Project Syndicate) — One of the most extraordinary things about the current protests in Iran — the largest since the Green Movement in 2009 — is that the very people that they are directed against may well have been the people who started them. Iran's ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate President Hassan Rouhani.
The system is, by just about all measures, stacked against those with low incomes and low wealth for the benefit of the wealthiest, says the report from the nonpartisan but left-leaning Prosperity Now nonprofit, which provides research and recommendations regarding Americans with limited incomes.
For the first time, this year's Prosperity Now Scorecard included data on Americans' levels of personal debt and their debt management. Both have been improving, overall — but there are a few debt trends going in the wrong direction.
Another staffer blamed the failure of leaders to punish disloyal members by removing their earmarks.
And roughly half of renters (46% of white renters and 54% of renters of color) are what Prosperity Now calls cost-burdened — they spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. That lowers their ability to save to buy a home, said Wiedrich. The homeownership figure in America has not really moved.

Gold has moved into recovery mode, a move which coincides with the dollar moving into correction. I had been skeptical of the late December rally, however, each day this week the gold price has been pulling higher and the recovery is gathering pace, said Richard Perry, market analyst at Hantec Markets, in a note.
California-based Opportunity Fund has been serving residents of the state since 1994, with more than $160 million in microloans. Its borrowers have a median household income of $31,000 a year. Around 90% are minority-owned businesses, and about 30% are women-owned businesses. Opportunity Fund also provides financial literacy education to business owners.

Many of these communities restrict residents to age 55 and up. That can attract older people who welcome the chance to kick back and relax with their own kind.
Gold settled higher on Wednesday, as a benchmark dollar index dropped to a three-month low. Prices for the precious metal then extended gains into electronic trading shortly after minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's December meeting revealed that some Federal Reserve members wanted to hold policy steady in December. The news put even more pressure on the dollar. February gold gcg9 traded at $1,293 an ounce, after settling on Comex at $1,292, up $6.10, or 0.5% for the session.

But that request, some argue, could be a sign that the bureau is preparing to slow down. This is the latest chapter in Mulvaney's long campaign to undermine and completely dismantle the consumer bureau, wrote Debbie Goldstein, the executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit based in Durham, N.C. She said requesting zero dollars sent the message that its work of defending consumers is not worth a penny.
 The U.S showed less social support, less sense of personal freedom, lower donations, and more perceived corruption of government and business. 
Sunak said in November that government support measures to that date to help businesses cope with the COVID-19 pandemic would cost about £280 billion this financial year.
Mulvaney's op-ed and recent statements have alarmed some consumer advocates. I don't think anybody in their right mind would say they believe consumers need less protecting, and who really needs help is banks, predators and financial bad actors, said Karl Frisch, the executive director of Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog organization.
We are living today in an American economy which is doing very well for the people on top, not so well for working families, Sanders said.

Economists at Morgan Stanley say their capex plans index (which is based on the regional Fed surveys of capital-spending expectations) has fallen in eight of the past nine months to the lowest level in a year.
Paying your dues might seem old-school to many these days, but there are some surprising benefits to grunt work. Not only did plenty of super-successful people start on the lowest rung of the ladder, but their early experiences in low-level positions frequently seeded their path to success—whether inspiring future projects, teaching them valuable workplace lessons or offering low-risk opportunities to up their game.
What the Prosperity Now report doesn't mention, however, is that the new tax law also doubled the standard deduction (to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly) and doubled the child-care tax credit (to as much as $2,000 per qualifying child). Both changes stand to help low-income Americans.

I'd ask, 'What do you think of living here?' and people really opened up, she recalled. They might complain about a special assessment added to their homeowner dues to pay for roof repairs or the restrictive policy regarding the type and number of dogs you could have.
That creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. High prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. The dip in U.S. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.

A Bank of America BAC, +2.61% spokeswoman in San Francisco told MarketWatch that the bank was reviewing its policies related to the purchase of such crypto assets as bitcoin BTCUSD, +0.68% but declined to discuss further.
Postcollege, he was hired as a buyer trainee while working his way through grad school. Armed with an M.B.A., he landed a position at the Bentonville, Ark. headquarters and rose quickly through the ranks as a buyer, merchandise manager and senior VP. He snagged a major promotion in 2006, when he was named CEO of Sam's Club, a Wal-Mart WMT, -1.31% subsidiary. Three years later, he was put in charge of Wal-Mart International, where he grew international sales by 29%. In 2014, he became the company's fifth CEO.
But overspending is in the eye of the beholder. At their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (Discretionary spending is money over which Congress has direct control, unlike Social Security or Medicare, for example.) As a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that Democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.
The Japanese yen USDJPY, -0.01% strengthened against the U.S. dollar on Friday, as Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda affirmed the central bank would continue to support the Japanese economy through monetary easing. Kuroda also said that inflation was finally getting close to the BOJ's target of 2% and that there would be a slight pickup in inflation expectations. Japan is understood to have the loosest approach to monetary policy among the developed economies, and is expected to be one of the last to join the trend of policy normalization. The dollar last bought ¥108.95, down from ¥109.41. The pair touched its lowest level since September on Thursday.
Businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectors will be able to claim up to £9,000 ($12,235) in one-off grants to help them cope with the latest restrictions, which were announced late on Monday night by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
In practice, we expect no significant short-term effect of tax reform on average hourly earnings — as it excludes irregular bonuses — and only a marginal boost to the employment cost index — as irregular bonuses are smoothed out, according to a note written by economist Daan Struyven.
The continued softening in the index indicates restrained capital spending activity in 2019 as the shine of tax stimulus fades, and slower global growth, uncertainty around trade policy, and tighter financial conditions weigh on investment plans, said Morgan Stanley economist Molly Wharton in a note to clients.
President Trump's latest remarks about immigrants follows criticisms last month made by Professor Philip Alston, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, about growing inequality in the U.S. He released a report heaping scorn on what he described as the Trump administration's dramatic change of direction in U.S. policies relating to inequality and extreme poverty. He cited the administration's current tax proposals and dramatic cuts in welfare.
Money managers and investors are hoping for the best when it comes to President-elect Donald Trump's potential to bring strong growth and inflation to the U.S. and abroad, but that doesn't mean they're ready to shift into full bull mode yet.

A further £594 million will be made available to local authorities and devolved administrations to support businesses not eligible for the grants.
Several Fed voting members noted that if the labor market appeared to be tightening significantly more than expected, it might become necessary to adjust the FOMC's communications about the expected path of the federal funds rate, consistent with the possibility that a less gradual pace of increases could become appropriate, the minutes said.

Manufacturers in the Dallas and Kansas City Federal Reserve districts have noticed, Morgan Stanley's Wharton points out. Declining oil prices are a concern going into the first quarter of 2019, one fabricated metal product manufacturer told the Dallas Fed in December. About half of energy firms in the district have lowered their capital spending plans for 2019.

Since 2018, many have argued for a return to earmarking to grease the wheels for appropriations bills. Pro-earmark arguments have come from members of Congress of both parties and President Donald Trump.
Mulvaney and Cordray trade insults over the CFPB's future
U.S. stock futures pointed to sharp losses at the open on Wednesday as slumping oil prices, weak Chinese data and an alleged nuclear test in North Korea unnerve investors. See full story.
The evidence for this effect is nuanced, however.
You see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost, he says. But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn't a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, 'We're here.…We're more affordable.'

After a study of county-level economic data, Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.
Iran's leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the Middle East over the past decade, beachheads that regime hardliners regard as crucial national-security and foreign-policy assets.
Efforts to revive earmarking over the past few years have been driven by an additional factor: Congress' near total inability to pass individual spending bills in a timely manner since the ban was adopted.
The current level of oil prices puts energy investment on a cusp, wrote Carpenter of UBS. Further declines in the price of West Texas Intermediate are likely to have a substantively negative effect on energy's contribution to U.S. GDP.
Alexander Arnon of the Penn Wharton Budget Model estimated in a blog post titled The Price of Oil is Now a Key Driver of Business Investment that firmer oil prices accounted for almost all of the growth in investment in 2018.
in grantham's words either way, the market is now checking off all the touchy-feely characteristics of a major bubble.
You know, look, if they had their money in their coffers, they could have done it last year, the year before, the year before, the year before, Cohn said Tuesday.
In cases where these employees can't turn to family or friends, companies that provide payday loans are going to benefit a little bit, because there's going to be a request for funds, said Collender, known for his Budget Guy blog.

Microloans disbursed in 2014: $18.7 million
But this would hardly count as success for the protesters. After all, Rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm. If protecting their government's religious purity — and their own ill-gotten gains — required brutally repressing their own people and returning Iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.
Specifically, Mulvaney may look closely at the definition of abusive and specify how the bureau and attorneys general should regulate companies, said Nick Gess, a principal at Morgan Lewis, a law firm based in Washington, D.C. Despite what some argue, most institutions want to comply with the law.
To address the inevitable and existential challenges that hospitality faces, we need confirmation of extensions to the business rates holiday and of the 5% VAT [value-added tax] rate, she added.
Alston spent two weeks traveling through California, Alabama, Georgia, Puerto Rico, West Virginia, and Washington D.C. and spoke with dozens of experts and civil society groups, met with senior state and federal government officials and talked with many people who are homeless or living in deep poverty. Contrasts between private wealth and public squalor abound, Alston said.
When considering these lenders, keep in mind that microloans have limitations. Because many nonprofits rely on grants, donations or government guarantees or allocations, the number of loans they offer and the amount you can borrow are limited. Funding constraints can also mean strict borrower requirements. And many nonprofits operate only in specific states or regions.
By a unanimous vote on Dec. 14, the Fed raised its federal-funds range by a quarter-percentage point to 0.50%-0.75%, its second rate increase in a decade. At the same time, Fed officials said economic conditions will warrant only gradual increases in the federal-funds rate. In the so-called dot plot, Fed officials penciled in three quarter-point rate increases in 2017 instead of two seen in September.
Microlenders typically offer loans of $50,000 or less to startups and other small-scale operations. Some make bigger loans to more established businesses.
It felt like there were a thousand stories in every [hospital] room and there is something really great about that idea, she told People magazine. And then surgery, just the idea that you could hold a human being's heart in your hand and you are responsible for life or death… I felt like [doctors] were warriors. That was really intriguing for me.
The larger question is whether you'll thrive in these planned developments springing up around the country. The real estate brochures make them sound heavenly: gorgeous homes, no crime, fun activities. But problems might lurk behind the ritzy clubhouse, artificial lakes and stunning views.

Latest evidence that the CFPB is losing its teeth
Given that the party of the president almost always loses seats in midterm elections, Democrats could lose their majority altogether in the 2022 congressional elections. Earmarks could help endangered Democrats shore up their support among voters back home.
Microloans disbursed in 2014: $8.9 million
After a study of county-level economic data, Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS Securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.
Some Fed officials saw this as a modest risk and said that a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate might help return inflation to the Fed's 2% target. But this seemed to be a minority view.
Consumer advocates are also concerned that the CFPB will get rid of the database of complaints related to current investigations, which allows the public to air complaints publicly. It also provided a direct way for the public to engage with the CFPB's activities.
As Congress wrestles with the process of passing individual appropriations bills, congressional leaders are poised to once again allow earmarks in appropriations bills to ease the bills' passage and protect vulnerable Democrats at the polls.
The minutes also show some talk of slowing down the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet. At the moment, the Fed is letting $50 billion of maturing securities run off the balance sheet each month.
Low-wage jobs are a chief reason so many low-income Americans have trouble making ends meet these days, according to Wiedrich.
The unemployment rate is almost at that level having dropped to 4.6% in November.
In 2017, over a half-million workers received the federal minimum wage, and another 1.8 million workers made below that, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Nineteen states and 21 cities and counties increased their minimum wage in January, with many raising it to $15 an hour. Another 21 jurisdictions will raise pay by the end of the year, according to the National Employment Law Project.
Years ago, you'd visit your grandparents in a gated community and think, I'd never want to live here.

The U.K.'s hospitality sector suffered lost sales of more than £53 billion ($72 billion) in 2020 due to the impact of coronavirus restrictions on trade, according to a data report by CGA and UKHospitality published in December.
You see a lot of businesses trading off speed and efficiency for cost, he says. But you also see an incredibly crowded marketplace where there isn't a whole lot of transparency. Nonprofits have the challenge of getting the word out there that, 'We're here.…We're more affordable.' 
 This is only a sticking plaster for immediate ills  — Kate Nicholls, CEO, UKHospitality
While the partial government shutdown is largely bad news for U.S. companies, payday lenders look set for a boost.
Prosperity Now argues that the 2017 tax law and a wave of deregulation by the Trump administration and Congress are helping the wealthiest Americans and corporations far more than people with low incomes.
Mulvaney wrote in an op-ed published in January The Wall Street Journal that the bureau will no longer push the envelope. When it comes to enforcement, we will focus on quantifiable and unavoidable harm to the consumer, he wrote. If we find that it exists, you can count on us to pursue the appropriate remedies vigorously. If it doesn't, we won't go looking for excuses to bring lawsuits.
In other words, no, these PR announcements aren't really evidence of the economy getting better for workers in a meaningful way. But tax reform may yet make things better. It's too early to tell.
A number of officials said the Fed should be mindful of the downside risks and the effects of past rate hikes before making any further changes to policy. Officials stressed policy was not on a pre-set course.
Earmarks can help members win reelection, especially when members claim credit for them.

Paying your dues might seem old-school to many these days, but there are some surprising benefits to grunt work. Not only did plenty of super-successful people start on the lowest rung of the ladder, but their early experiences in low-level positions frequently seeded their path to success—whether inspiring future projects, teaching them valuable workplace lessons or offering low-risk opportunities to up their game.
Many states have already been lifting their minimum wages above the federal minimum. Some 5.3 million workers started receiving higher pay starting Jan. 1, according to an analysis released by the left-leaning think tank Economic Policy Institute.
The current level of oil prices puts energy investment on a cusp, wrote Carpenter of UBS. Further declines in the price of West Texas Intermediate are likely to have a substantively negative effect on energy's contribution to U.S. GDP.
Still bitcoin has gained wider acceptance on Wall Street with the CME Group Inc. and the Cboe Global Markets kicking off trading last month in cash-settled bitcoin futures.
Now, following the 2020 election, House Democrats have apparently decided to return to the practice. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland announced on Nov. 20 that the Appropriations Committee would soon begin soliciting member requests for earmarks, with a focus on projects that would benefit nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.
Business Center for New Americans provides financing of between $500 and $50,000 to small businesses in New York City. Borrowers must be in the retail, light manufacturing, restaurant or service industry, and existing businesses must have at least three to six months of verifiable revenue, according to the organization. Brand-new companies must present a startup budget.

Now, hopes that the investment boom would continue into 2019 are in tatters, victim to four factors that are dragging on the economy: reduced fiscal stimulus (including the shutdown), a weakening global economy, the uncertainty of Donald Trump's trade policy and soft oil prices.
But there is evidence that constituents are more likely to reward Democrats than Republicans. This is not entirely surprising, given that earmarks are consistent with Democrats' commitment to activist government, whereas for Republicans committed to minimizing the cost of government, bringing home earmarks could be painted as hypocritical.
The bureau already had $177 million in reserves, enough to cover the $145 million the bureau projected it would need during the second quarter, he said. I see no practical reason for such a large reserve, Mulvaney wrote in his funds request to the Federal Reserve, since I am informed that the board has never denied a bureau request for funding and has always delivered requested funds in a timely fashion.
The last word here on tax cuts and worker pay goes to Cohn's former employer, Goldman Sachs. In a research note, the firm looked at both the corporate PR announcements and the minimum wage hikes in 18 states.
These days, Queen B has a full-time glam squad at her beck and call. But she's revealed in a documentary that she was once on the other side of the curling iron at her mom's Houston salon.
The CFPB has had some major wins against the financial services industry in recent years, but a majority of Americans appear to be unaware. More than 80% of people said they did not know enough about the CFPB to form an opinion of it, in a 2017 survey by the credit-card website CreditCards.com. (Since then, more people likely know about the CFPB because of recent controversies, Frisch said.)
The next question to ask is whether the companies are making the announcement because of the tax cuts, or whether they're dressing up what they had already been doing to curry favor from a particularly sensitive administration.
Investors appear to be pulling back on their hopes for a more aggressive pace of rate hikes after Fed policy makers pointed to a number of risks that, if realized, might call for a different path of policy than the currently expected, according to the minutes.

There is incredible uncertainty relating to the TSA, and as that relates to air travel and tourism, said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research for Compass Point Research and Trading, referring to reports of longer lines at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints as agents who aren't getting paid call out sick. (In the wake of such reports, the TSA said 90% of U.S. passengers waited less than 15 minutes on Sunday, while a big pilots union has called for an end to the shutdown because it's hurting safety and efficiency.)

In reality, however, the Prosperity Now report said, the dominant narrative about low-wealth people is nothing but a series of myths. Poor choices, the analysts there say, aren't why people are poor.
Banks taking a harder look at the use of debt to buy digital assets come as bitcoin and its rivals have ballooned in popularity in recent months. The fervor around virtual coins has been compared with tulip mania, with as prominent a banker as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s CEO Jamie Dimon at one point describing the craze over bitcoin and its brethren as a fraud and speculative bubble that will end badly. A call to J.P. Morgan about its credit-card policy toward bitcoin weren't immediately returned.
The late Sen. John McCain, for example, called earmarks the gateway drug to corruption and overspending.
The bill was introduced with 181 House cosponsors and 31 Senate cosponsors. It is highly unlikely to become law under a Republican-controlled Senate.
LiftFund, listed above among top U.S. microlenders, also offers SBA Community Advantage loans of $50,000 to $250,000 to businesses in low- to moderate-income communities in 13 states. Business owners can also qualify if more than 50% of their full-time workforce is low-income or if their employees live in areas designated as low- to moderate-income communities.
Before heading to Davos, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was asked about the wave of companies who are saying they are increasing wages or bonuses due to the recently enacted tax cuts.
Kiva U.S. is a part of Kiva, a nonprofit working in more than 80 countries. To receive an interest-free microloan through Kiva U.S., borrowers first must have friends and family members lend to the venture. This helps establish the borrower's creditworthiness. Once that happens, Kiva opens the loan to its lenders for funding.
My own research shows that between 1994 and 2000, as Congress went from Democratic to Republican control, earmarks, once highly effective in inducing members to vote for appropriations bills, became gradually less so.

Cost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like Texas and Florida, Sonn said. This will put thousands more in the pockets of struggling workers who right now are often going into debt and just aren't able to afford the basics.

But that's not good news for consumers, especially low-income households who often turn to payday lenders who have charged interest rates of up to 400%, Frisch said. There is no reason to delay implementation of this rule — unless you are more concerned with the needs of payday lenders than you are with the interests of the consumers these financial bottom-feeders prey upon, he told MarketWatch.

Some airlines have voiced concerns about delays in the certification of new aircraft and slowdowns in the training of pilots and air traffic controllers, said Clayton Allen, a Height Capital Markets analyst.
The price of a single bitcoin soared to nearly $20,000 last December but has since cooled considerably amid a wave of heightened scrutiny from regulators in Asia and a domestic intent to tamp down speculation. Bitcoin has lost about half its value since its peak last year but is still up 1,025% since the end of 2016, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% is up 34% and the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% has gained 27% over the period.
A California law that went into effect on Jan. 1 prohibits secret settlement agreements pertaining to sexual harassment or sex discrimination.

President Trump on Thursday reportedly used vulgar language to describe immigrants from Haiti and African countries and said the U.S. needed more immigrants from countries like Norway. On Friday, Trump denied using the word shithole countries, but said he used tough language. The president's reported comments were described as racist by Rupert Colville, the United Nations spokesman for human rights. Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years.

California has also become the first state to require some company boards to have at least one female member. Any publicly traded company with headquarters in the state must have one woman board member by the end of 2019 and, by 2021, companies with at least five directors need to have two or three female directors, depending on the size of the board.

But that request, some argue, could be a sign that the bureau is preparing to slow down. This is the latest chapter in Mulvaney's long campaign to undermine and completely dismantle the consumer bureau, wrote Debbie Goldstein, the executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit based in Durham, N.C. She said requesting zero dollars sent the message that its work of defending consumers is not worth a penny.

There's good reason to believe that the tax cut had almost no impact on business investment. Rather, it was strong demand, especially for oil, that encouraged businesses to expand capacity. Now investment is softening along with aggregate demand.
Mulvaney wrote that the bureau previously believed we were the good guys and the financial-service industry was the bad guys, but that will change, he said.

The first item is to look at what companies have said. The Grover Norquist-led Americans for Tax Reform has been keeping an exhaustive list, relying not just on press releases but also news stories and reader submissions. The benefit of using this list is also that it's the most generous tabulation — this is an organization that was wildly enthusiastic about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

According to the biography The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life, he brainstormed strategies to deliver his papers as fast as possible, sold calendars and magazine subscriptions on the side and took in $2,000 in two years. At 15, he hammered out a profit-share agreement with a farmer in Nebraska and invested $1,200 of those earnings in a 40-acre farm. So, uh, not exactly your average teen.
California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon have done this; Massachusetts, New Jersey, Vermont and Washington, the Prosperity Now report said, are pursuing similar strategies. That could be especially helpful for low-income people; 77% of the lowest-earning workers lack access to an employer-provided retirement plan.

Such offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown Americans often have low levels of savings. Big banks including Wells Fargo WFC, -0.88% and Bank of America BAC, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a New York Times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. Pro baseball is getting involved, as the Washington Nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.
From a financial standpoint, you'll want to consider the monthly dues, what they cover and whether they're likely to go up. Well-run homeowner associations maintain fully funded reserves rather than relying on steep assessments from time to time to cover deferred maintenance and other costs.

The ongoing shutdown has been sparked by a dispute over money for President Donald Trump's proposed wall at the Mexican border. The president on Wednesday left a negotiating session after clashing with top Democratic lawmakers, and Trump stated Thursday that he could declare a national emergency in order to build his wall if there's no deal with Democrats, saying probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely. Analysts have noted the impact of the current shutdown is somewhat limited, because it's only affecting agencies that represent about 25% of total government spending.

To hear Brenda Robertson tell it, Georgia needs someone like Raphael Warnock in the Senate.
A few Fed officials were also against a December interest rate increase, the minutes show, although the voting members of the FOMC decided to push ahead with an interest-rate hike.
Many of these communities restrict residents to age 55 and up. That can attract older people who welcome the chance to kick back and relax with their own kind.
The U.S. has seen its happiness slide happiness over the last decade. In 2007, it ranked No. 3 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. But it now hovers at 19th place, partly due to the political discourse. The predominant political discourse in the United States is aimed at raising economic growth, with the goal of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that is supposed to accompany it. But the data show conclusively that this is the wrong approach, economist Jeffrey Sachs wrote in the report.
Many of the cashiers had years of experience and were very committed to their jobs, so I saw firsthand the importance of a great work ethic, she told Fortune. I learned that speed mattered… The only way to be eligible to work an express lane was to do 40 items per minute consistently. I also learned a lot about family economics, how people make trade-offs and how people make decisions on something fundamental, like how to eat.
We've heard more rhetoric lately about [low-income] people making 'bad choices' or being 'irresponsible with money' and that's been the direction policy has been going,' said Kasey Wiedrich, director of applied research at Prosperity Now. We wanted to attack that. One example of the rhetoric: Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) recently said lower-income Americans are just spending every darn penny they have whether it's on booze or women or movies.
In the normal appropriations process, Congress would pass 12 individual spending bills each year, a process designed to give legislators a chance to examine the spending in each bill before voting.
Profit is not their objective. Many microlenders are called mission-focused or mission-based lenders. They offer loans from government or nonprofit programs geared to helping disadvantaged communities, including areas that are struggling economically. Some microlenders also operate internationally, helping entrepreneurs in developing nations.
Microloans disbursed in 2014: $17.7 million
San Antonio-based LiftFund offers microloans in the southern U.S., including Texas, Georgia and Florida. Borrowers typically use the financing to buy equipment and supplies. The microloans are also meant to help small-business owners improve their credit and more likely to qualify for a bank loan in the future, the lender says on its website. LiftFund got a boost in October 2016 when J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced almost $5 million in funding for its new small-business loan program in New Orleans, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Texas.
These differences could help explain why, in my research, earmarks provided leaders with less leverage over members' votes in Republican-controlled congresses.
While Fed officials remained optimistic about the outlook, contacts in a number of Fed districts were less upbeat, the minutes said.

Many Fed officials judged the risk of a sizable undershooting of the normal jobless rate had increased somewhat and that the Federal Open Market Committee might need to raise the federal-funds rate more quickly than currently anticipated to limit the degree of undershooting and stem a potential buildup of inflationary pressures, according to the minutes.
This year's Scorecard found that nearly one in four jobs are in low-wage occupations — ones that don't pay enough to keep families above the federal poverty line. And, Prosperity Now's researchers say, even though unemployment has been cut in half since its peak in 2010 (from 9.6% to 4.5%), the rate of low-wage jobs has decreased by just two percentage points since 2013 (to 25.6%) and is still higher than in 2010 (when the rate was 21.5%).
The system is, by just about all measures, stacked against those with low incomes and low wealth for the benefit of the wealthiest, says the report from the nonpartisan but left-leaning Prosperity Now nonprofit, which provides research and recommendations regarding Americans with limited incomes.
Congressional Democrats on Wednesday introduced legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
 Immigrants from poor countries come to America for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the U.S. has worsened in recent years. 
At some point, the economy will encounter another downswing or recession and those who are not benefiting much from today's economic gains will be hardest hit, said Wiedrich.
President Trump declared in his State of the Union speech that we can lift our citizens… from poverty to prosperity. But, Prosperity Now maintains, to make that happen, more states and federal policymakers need to do more — especially now, when times are good for so many.
The evidence for this effect is nuanced, however.
Fifty-six-year-old Herbert Chaplin got to Jonesville Baptist Church in Savannah at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, and said he wanted to make sure he cast his ballot before it was too late.
With the Trump administration and Republican Congress, it's been states driving progress and innovation, said Paul Sonn, state policy director at the New York-based nonprofit National Employment Law Project, a liberal-leaning think tank that advocates for workers' rights.
It is possible, for example, that Rouhani will end up stepping down, whether by force or choice.
Word is still out on the inspiration behind McDreamy.
Trump complained in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last Friday that the Chinese yuan USDCNY, had become too weak and the dollar too strong, saying U.S. companies can't compete with China due to that currency imbalance. The comments weighed on the dollar and stocks Tuesday.
There's good reason to believe that the tax cut had almost no impact on business investment. Rather, it was strong demand, especially for oil, that encouraged businesses to expand capacity. Now investment is softening along with aggregate demand.

What the Prosperity Now report doesn't mention, however, is that the new tax law also doubled the standard deduction (to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly) and doubled the child-care tax credit (to as much as $2,000 per qualifying child). Both changes stand to help low-income Americans.
The U.S. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. The tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. Maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.
