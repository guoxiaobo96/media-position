iranian citizens are not alone in taking issue with their country's foreign policy. most western and middle eastern governments are also highly concerned about iran's behavior, which reflects a rejection of international norms such as respect for national sovereignty. iran's public threats to destroy america and the gulf states certainly don't help matters.
there isn't a nice, neat average bonus figure readily available, but you can mix and match data to get to a very rough estimate. labor department data finds that, on a per-hour basis, employers paid out nonproduction bonuses equal to 3.2% of the wages and salaries per worker. data released earlier this month shows the typical full-time worker made $857 per week, before bonuses.
the u.s. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. the tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.

when it comes to a trade war, many regard trump as a risk. in a speech at the world economic forum in davos on tuesday, chinese president xi jinping lauded globalization and said no one will emerge as a winner in a trade war. it wouldn't be far fetched to imagine those comments were made in response to promises from trump to slap tariffs on chinese goods to lift u.s. manufacturing.
the group's report cites a tax policy center estimate that the new tax law will translate to a $51,140 tax cut for the wealthiest 1% of households, but families earning less than $25,000 in 2018 will see a mere $60 in tax savings. house speaker paul ryan (r-wis.) just took heat for tweeting about a pennsylvania high-school secretary who was pleasantly surprised her paycheck rose $1.50 a week due to the tax cut.

president trump on thursday reportedly used vulgar language to describe immigrants from haiti and african countries and said the u.s. needed more immigrants from countries like norway. on friday, trump denied using the word shithole countries, but said he used tough language. the president's reported comments were described as racist by rupert colville, the united nations spokesman for human rights. immigrants from poor countries come to america for a better life as, numerous studies show, social inequality in the u.s. has worsened in recent years.

norway moves to the top of the ranking despite weaker oil prices, the report noted. it is sometimes said that norway achieves and maintains its high happiness not because of its oil wealth, but in spite of it. by choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present, norway has insulated itself from the boom and bust cycle of many other resource-rich economies.

whether rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely — indeed, perhaps not for very much longer. iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship. but, thanks partly to persistent corruption — iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area — annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%. according to gallup, only citizens of iraq and south sudan are more pessimistic about their future.

at&t t, -0.46% , for instance, had already agreed to the bonus in talks with its union, when it made its announcement on dec. 20. that said, the communications workers of america told thinkprogress — a website of a left-wing policy group — that at&t agreed to the bonuses after the cwa argued employees should get the $4,000 wage increase that the white house promised the tax cut would provide. that actually argues in favor of the cohn point — the tax cuts led to an economic environment resulting in increased pay for workers.
my interviews with committee staff members suggested various reasons for this diminished effectiveness. prominent among them, according to one staffer, was the fact that votes were increasingly … on highly charged substantive policy matters. senators needed to vote on those issues in a partisan manner, regardless of earmarks.

that creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. high prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. the dip in u.s. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.

cost of living data shows $15 an hour is what single workers in all 50 states need to afford the basics, and that's what they need in even low-cost states like texas and florida, sonn said. this will put thousands more in the pockets of struggling workers who right now are often going into debt and just aren't able to afford the basics.

gold settled higher on wednesday, as a benchmark dollar index dropped to a three-month low. prices for the precious metal then extended gains into electronic trading shortly after minutes from the federal open market committee's december meeting revealed that some federal reserve members wanted to hold policy steady in december. the news put even more pressure on the dollar. february gold gcg9 traded at $1,293 an ounce, after settling on comex at $1,292, up $6.10, or 0.5% for the session.

although the senate has appeared more committed to its ban, senate appropriations chairman richard shelby, r-ala., and other senate republicans and democrats are also receptive to reviving earmarking.
federal reserve officials saw the possibility that they might have to raise interest rates faster than the gradual pace that they have stressed for some time, according to minutes of the december meeting released wednesday.

washington (marketwatch) - still-low inflation readings and signs that inflation might actually soften in the near term made the federal reserve's rate hike a close call for some officials, according to the minutes of the december 15-16 meeting, released wednesday. fed officials voted unanimously last month to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 but the minutes make clear that some were more reluctant to hike than others. going forward, the central bankers agreed to add to the policy statement that they were watching actual and expected progress towards to 2% inflation target carefully because of their significant concern about still-low readings on actual inflation and the uncertainty and risks present in the inflation outlook. more generally, fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside.

low-wage jobs are a chief reason so many low-income americans have trouble making ends meet these days, according to wiedrich.
first, iran's leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game — a belief shared with russian president vladimir putin. (that commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between russia and iran.) second — and more dangerous — iran's leaders believe that they have a god-given right to unite shia muslims under a single caliphate. the result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors' success as a threat — and is willing to wage war over it.

an urban institute study of 60 u.s. cities discovered that the predominately white areas had a median credit score 80 points higher than in predominately non-white neighborhoods, which can cost families of color $100 or more each month on a mortgage. and the federal reserve board's survey of consumer finances found that african-american households are twice as likely as white household to be late on credit payments.
a few things become clear when looking at the list. one is that, generally, the companies are making one-time payments, typically on the order of $1,000 per non-executive employee. a notable minority also mention lifting their minimum wage to $15 per hour.
these differences could help explain why, in my research, earmarks provided leaders with less leverage over members' votes in republican-controlled congresses.

gold prices gave up earlier lows on wednesday to end higher for a fifth session, then eased back in electronic trading from their settlement shortly after the release of the u.s. federal reserve's beige book. the report, which offers a snapshot of domestic economic activity, said the pace of growth continues to be modest to moderate. the report comes ahead of the fed's next monetary policy meeting, during which the central bank is expected to keep short-term interest rates steady. february gold gcg8 was at $1,338.30 an ounce in electronic trading. prices had gained $2.10, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,339.20 an ounce for the session, their highest since sept. 8, according to factset data.

the fact is, however, that the companies making these announcements are typically in highly regulated industries. at&t, which has been trying to win support for its time warner us:twx merger, kicked off these announcements, and it is mostly banks, from giants like bank of america bac, +2.61% to lesser-known lenders like bank of advance and flushing financial corp., ffic, +0.62% announcing them. several utilities have additionally announced planned rate cuts.
such offers during the shutdown make sense, given that many studies have shown americans often have low levels of savings. big banks including wells fargo wfc, -0.88% and bank of america bac, -0.29% are not making similar loans to affected government workers, a new york times report noted, though some are waiving overdraft and monthly service fees. pro baseball is getting involved, as the washington nationals said affected season ticket holders could postpone monthly payments for tickets.

a public database has been a powerful mechanism for keeping financial predators accountable to consumers, melissa stegman, senior policy counsel at the center for responsible lending, a nonprofit based in durham, n.c., told marketwatch. pulling the complaints behind a cloak of secrecy would help let unscrupulous companies get away with mistreating consumers.
consumer advocates are also concerned that the cfpb will get rid of the database of complaints related to current investigations, which allows the public to air complaints publicly. it also provided a direct way for the public to engage with the cfpb's activities.
nevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. then-sen. claire mccaskill, d-mo., in 2018 called earmarks the washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. to supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. and not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.
a retirement crisis is looming in the country. americans are not saving enough for their futures and in many cases, don't have access to a workplace retirement account to start. states have taken it upon themselves to implement retirement plans, and in some cases, require companies to offer a retirement plan if they have no alternatives in place.

congressional democrats on wednesday introduced legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
federal spending bills normally allocate an amount of money for general purposes and often defer to federal agency officials or state leaders to determine which particular projects best meet the overall goals. earmarks are specific congressional instructions that carve out some of those funds, declaring directly that x amount of money must be spent on y project.
all in all, wiedrich said, americans with low wealth generally aren't reaping the benefits of today's humming economy. their wages aren't keeping up with the rising costs of housing and health care. also, many are dealing with income volatility, which makes it hard to plan and to make ends meet, said wiedrich.

earmarks are vulnerable to other criticisms as well, not least of which is the disproportionate share awarded to the states and districts of the most powerful members.
pacific community ventures is a san francisco-based community development lender that offers loans of between $10,000 and $200,000 to small businesses in california. you need to have been in business at least a year and have at least two employees. however, if you have a solid business record and a firm grasp of your business finances, pcv may offer you a loan even if you fall short on some requirements.

to be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of iran's government, appeals based on iranians' economic prospects will fall on deaf ears. but if rouhani retains the presidency — or another moderate takes his place — there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back iran's foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy. this would minimize the risk of severe violence in iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.
paying your dues might seem old-school to many these days, but there are some surprising benefits to grunt work. not only did plenty of super-successful people start on the lowest rung of the ladder, but their early experiences in low-level positions frequently seeded their path to success—whether inspiring future projects, teaching them valuable workplace lessons or offering low-risk opportunities to up their game.
but overspending is in the eye of the beholder. at their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (discretionary spending is money over which congress has direct control, unlike social security or medicare, for example.) as a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.

but producing oil from shale is different in an important way: the investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. this means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.
