However, the regulator said it did not follow up on the majority of potential instances of misconduct identified by its electronic surveillance system.

I left my friend's apartment in Brooklyn two hours before my 11 p.m. flight and called a local car service. Everything that could go wrong went wrong.

It isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. We haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. I'm not advocating that. But I think it is an intentional policy. It is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.

This makes life hard for the central bank. For instance, it makes it more difficult for the central bank to engineer a soft landing for the economy, Rosengren said. It also means the Fed cannot pause in its gradual pace of rate hikes and should even pick up the pace a bit this year. The U.S. central bank might have to raise rates four times in 2018, he said, more than the median forecast of Fed officials or the two hikes the market expects.

Bad things come in threes, or so goes the old saying, and the government shutdown looks like the third in a series of a policy missteps that have undermined the expansion and pushed the probability of a recession to the highest level since early 2007, said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard, in a Wednesday note, citing New York Federal Reserve Bank data.

She noted that price-level targeting depends on the public's understanding the policy but also believing that future Fed officials would follow through, even in difficult times when the policy would call for higher rates to bring inflation down even if demand was weak.
In many ways, it is this recognition that has underpinned the U.K.'s post–World War II policy of constructive engagement. Notwithstanding an initial reluctance to join the EEC, the U.K. helped to foster the development of modern institutions in Germany. It supported the 1970s democratisation of Spain, Portugal, and Greece and, ultimately, the unification of Germany.
Meanwhile, women control more than half of U.S. personal wealth — but an average woman's retirement account is just over half that of an average man's, according to BMO Wealth Institute, partly because women earn less during their lifetimes, accumulate more debt, live longer and suffer more financially after divorces.
This strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of Republican Party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the Democrats take office. And finally, there are also some true believers in high Republican places; Mitch McConnell used some of these in the Senate to tell Trump no can do just before the election, when Trump leaned on Republican senators to reach a deal with the Democrats on the Heroes 2.0 COVID stimulus bill. Trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with Senate Republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.

For students born in the early 1980s, each extra year of school pushed their wages up about 7% on average, according to a working paper distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research this week. However, what you do with all that extra time is critical. After researchers stripped out variables such as demographics, whether students had accumulated work experience while in school and other unobservable characteristics, the wage premium went down to just 1%, the study found.

It has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy. Of course, some jobs — for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the U.S. — will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs.

Fears of a looming teacher shortage were growing even before the pandemic. Over the past decade the number of students studying to be educators has plummeted and the pandemic may only exacerbate some districts' challenges in finding teachers. Nearly 27% of educators said they were considering leaving the profession or taking a leave of absence because of COVID-19, according to a November survey published by Horace Mann Educators Corporation, which offers insurance and other financial products to educators.
When it comes to the dollar's weakness DXY, -0.03% against major currencies over the past year, reasons abound, including everything from an improved growth outlook for foreign economies and diminished need for stimulus to rising commodity prices to Washington's dysfunction to President Donald Trump's low standing in the world.

The problem is that the yield curve was a fine indicator of economic performance when the 10-year Treasury note yield was driven by market forces. With quantitative easing, this is not so much the case. When the Fed begins to unwind its balance sheet in earnest, it could also push the 10-year Treasury note yield higher — as it is happening now — in effect, controlling the yield curve and pushing against an inversion, which has preceded every one of the last five recessions.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Friday he thinks the central bank will only raise interest rates twice this year, one fewer than the central bank's median forecast of three moves. In a speech at the American Economic Association meeting in Philadelphia, Harker said the central bank will be in monitoring mode this year. There is a lot to watch generally, and much of it, in some form or another, is new territory, Harker said. The Philadelphia Fed president said he expects growth a little below 2.5% this year. He forecast that inflation will rise above the Fed's 2% target in 2019. If soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem, he said. Harker is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate policy committee this year.

On a call when the charge was first announced, Chief Risk Officer Ryan Zanin told analysts that a large percentage of policyholders in their book of business were sold policies at a very early age and are only now reaching the prime claim paying period—ages 80 and up.

Adam Minsky, a Boston-based student loan lawyer, suggests government workers who are furloughed and on an income-driven plan apply to have their monthly payments reduced based on their changed circumstances.

The only thing that goes up in falling markets is correlation (when stock and bond markets decline everything declines in value especially riskless investments) The Smart Money on Wall Street, and even Main Street, invests in only one type of investment: what they feel are undervalued securities. Today there are well over 1000 different sector funds and ETFs available. Sector funds (in which we recommend you invest) allow you to scan the horizon for rallying sectors. When the Smart Money investors identify an undervalued sector, their investment money start to invest in that sector, they will drive up the price of that sector; the more narrow the sector the more profound the market rise. A diversified portfolio of five or more sector funds allows diversification, liquidity and profit potential for investors. If you have gone to cash before the correction, you will have more money to invest in the recovering markets and you can afford to diversify among a number of sector funds increases the odds of finding a few sectors that generate significant capital gains. Given the longer-term momentum of well-undervalued securities in a down market, you have greater odds of earning tax-preferred long-term capital gains as we did with most of our largest portfolio allocations in 2013 and 2014. Lower long-term capital-gains profits reduce total return-oriented risk. Remember you only have to hold on for a year to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment.
That's our call of the day, and it comes from Barron's technical analyst Michael Kahn. The gold mining sector is the slice of the market that he's sounding bullish about. He says it's a short-term call, but a long-term bull run can't be ruled out.

Here's the plan. If your total itemizable deductions for 2020 will be close to your standard deduction amount, consider making enough additional expenditures for itemized deduction items before year-end to exceed the standard deduction. Those prepayments will lower this year's tax bill. Next year, your standard deduction might be a bit bigger thanks to an inflation adjustment, and you can claim it then. Or it could be smaller, if major tax-increase legislation passes, which I think is unlikely.

It's already priced in: Because the market is forward-looking, information that's already known — projections for a company's revenue or earnings in a future quarter, for example — is taken into account in stock prices.

According to that July 2018 poll, however, 1 in 4 Americans also said that immigration is one of the most worrying issues facing Americans, an increase of 7 percentage points from February 2018. This concern was mostly driven by Democrats (whose worries about immigration rose from 10% to 20%) and Independents (up from 13% to 25%). Perhaps surprisingly given the president's GOP base, Republican concerns around immigration remained steady over that period at 34%.

The Fed's murder weapon is aptly encapsulated in the pictorial representation of the yield curve, or term structure of interest rates. When the central bank raises its benchmark, short-term rate to a level that exceeds that on a risk-free, long-term rate, such as the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.625% — that is, when the term spread inverts — a recession is sure to follow, with an average lead time of 14 months.
Financial markets knew President Trump would not go away quietly, but they didn't expect this, Moya told MarketWatch in an email.
It may be tempting to fault the savers for this sad state of affairs, but it is wrong to blame the victim. Here is the hard truth: existing tools make it impossible for most people to afford to save enough for retirement, and employers are not bridging the gap. People could try to delay retiring, but for various reasons that isn't always the worker's choice to make. Even those with significant savings to invest commonly see subpar returns, due in large part to lack of financial literacy and an industry short on reliable advice. Financial advisers, whose fees to their clients cost savers an estimated $17 billion per year, often guide them into trouble.

Hundreds of Trump supporters began pushing through metal barricades at the back of the Capitol building about 1 p.m. Wednesday.

There's also a stigma around female leadership. Females negotiating for a promotion are also labeled as bossy, aggressive or intimidating, according to a third of respondents in a 2016 Lean In/McKinsey & Company survey of 34,000 employees at 132 companies. Race is a factor too, with the rate of promotion for white women at 7.4%, 6% for Latinas, 5.8% for Asians and 4.9% for African-Americans.

Bad times tend to be better for women to be given a chance to be CEOs, said Ariane Hegewisch, program director of employment and earnings at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. When a company isn't doing well and everyone shies away from it, companies think 'we've tried the usual, now let's give an outsider a chance.' Taking the helm during tumultuous times is often riskier for person's career, she added. (Case in point: Marissa Mayer's five-year tenure as Yahoo! CEO.)
That's why we call ourselves investors when we open a 401(k) or a brokerage account. But in the vast majority of cases, we aren't actually investing anything at all in the company that only happens when a company sells new shares in an initial or secondary public offering. For most of us, the money we supply to buy shares simply goes to earlier shareholders who sold us our shares. We aren't really investors; we are speculators.

It has long been recognized that decarbonization, if done correctly, would be a great job creator, as the economy prepares itself for a world with renewable energy. Of course, some jobs — for example, those of the 53,000 coal miners in the U.S. — will be lost, and programs are needed to retrain such workers for other jobs.

And a small company with balance-sheet problems can't do what the big boys do — go back to markets and do a rights issue. That ultimately leads to a higher bankruptcy risk and bigger risks for the economy, which gets harder to ignore. Looking at the Fed's reversal in policy it seems far more connected to what's going on in credit markets and in terms of weakening companies, he said.
Laying the groundwork for new U.S. manufacturing jobs takes time; putting money in the hands of working-class Americans takes time; and getting them to spend more aggressively and invest that money takes even more time. That is sustainable, whereas monetary policy stimulus is not. So there is a huge added value to favorable fiscal policies.
9. About 90% of investment products have fees and costs which are too high. The academic research in this area, stretching back for decades now, is compelling—higher fees are almost certainly going to lead to lower returns over the long run. Consider a racehorse in the Kentucky Derby. All of the horses racing must carry the same weight—jockey, tack, and (when necessary to equalize things out) some small weights in the saddlebag. If a horse carries more weight (similar, for example, to investments with higher fees), the horse still might manage some smart strategy and win a short race, but for longer races the extra weight is definitely going to slow that horse down. By far the largest single factor affecting investor returns in mutual funds, variable annuities, ETFs and other pooled investment vehicles are the fees and costs incurred. Low-cost products will highly likely possess higher returns over the long run, and just a small difference in returns can add up over a long retirement.
WASHINGTON — Congress approved a measure Monday to fund the government for about three weeks and halt a three-day shutdown, after Senate Democrats accepted GOP leaders' assurance that they would bring an immigration bill to the floor in the coming weeks.
This intervention has also left a dysfunctional market where investing is simply knowing which day or stocks the government is buying, meaning many investors, particularly institutions cannot participate.

We should expect, without further action, that as the new strain takes hold, we will see an additional 10 million infections in the U.S. between now and end of February and during that time, we could easily see an additional 100,000 to 150,000 deaths, he said.

Think about it. What is a security worth to you? How about the net present value of a stream of a total of total return to you (dividends plus interest adjusted for principal gains and losses) discounted at a riskless rate of return (usually the interest rate on a new 10-year U.S. Treasury note)?

From a home buyer's perspective, most markets need more houses for sale, and they need to be on the affordable end of the price scale. After all, many first-timers buy starter homes instead of forever homes, with prices below the area's median.

Why the Federal Government Could Shut Down
My husband is financially smart. Without him, I would have likely traveled down the same financial road as my mother. With him, I have had the guidance and support to pay off years of mounting debt, buy a house and start saving for retirement. The thought of taking a hit to everything we have worked so hard to build causes a lot of stress. My husband has concerns about me not acquiring her debt and/or expenses when the time comes and he feels it will destroy us financially. I don't disagree with him. I just struggle with doing right by everyone.
You will now be getting a paycheck from the fruits of your labor in the form of distributions from investments. It may be taking equity out of your home in the form of a sale and downsizing, or taking out a reverse mortgage. It could be the sale of a business or creating a charitable remainder trust to minimize taxable gain and create an income stream. You could be starting to withdraw from a pension such as PERA or from former employer.

That means a single filer earning $190,150 (and taking the standard deduction) could pay $3,000 more in taxes under Trump's proposed plan, according to personal finance writer Sam Dogen. A single filer making $130,000 could pay $875 more in taxes, and joint filers who report gross income of $231,450 could see their taxes go up by about $320.
The U.S. Department of Labor finalized a rule Wednesday that could be a boon to app-based gig companies while potentially costing American workers billions of dollars in lost wages and benefits.
Before adjourning for the year, the House passed a measure that would increase the amount of stimulus checks Americans receive from $600 for an individual earning under $75,000 a year to $2,000. President Donald Trump also issued support for higher checks, but the enthusiasm failed to carry over into the Senate — and that's good news, according to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

Gold also moves inversely to the dollar. A cheaper greenback makes gold cheaper to buyers using other currencies and vice versa. Analysts said a prolonged stock market selloff could provide a lift for the metal, but jitters ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting might have dented near-term enthusiasm.

Instead, the driving force behind the session's stock-market gains and other financial-market moves appeared to be optimism over the prospect for another, larger round of aid spending following a Democratic sweep of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will give the party control of the Senate as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Jan. 20. Democrats retained control of the House in the Nov. 3 elections.

Nevertheless, the hesitancy on the part of U.S. public health officials stumped Marler. There's always a balance with these health officials between outing a company or product and giving the public information to protect themselves, but it's perplexing to me that this has been going on for a long period of time without naming a product, he said.
A more responsive and comprehensive approach would focus on enhancing systemic transparency with respect to education outcomes, costs, and opportunities, and also improving lenders' underwriting practices for student borrowers. Outcomes should be presented in clear and standardized formats, and government and private lenders should be considering expected future incomes before offering a student various levels of debt.

They learned something from the Great Recession of 2008-09. They fought and reduced Democratic stimulus plans—which were not big enough to begin with—as much as possible. The end result was unemployment in October 2010 was still at 9.4%; and millions more jobs were lacking if we look at the decline in employment since the recession, rather than the unemployment stats only.

Shares of Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% shed 0.5% in morning trade Wednesday, after UBS did an about-face on the banking giant, flipping to bearish from bullish, amid concerns over how new protectionist policies may affect Citigroup's global franchise. Analyst Saul Martinez gave the stock a rare sell rating, after it was at buy for nearly three years. He cut the stock price target to $58, which is 3.2% below current levels, from $64. Only 15% of companies covered by Citigroup have sell ratings. Citigroup's global franchise is generally a good thing, but it also leaves the company less levered to lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates in the U.S., and more exposed to risks associated with the President-elect's protectionist policy stances, Martinez wrote in a note to clients. He said an underperforming Mexican franchise and Asia consumer businesses in slower growth markets also dampen his view. The stock has soared 20% since the election, while the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.52% has climbed 18% and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% has gained 6%.

This may also give the partner filing for divorce time to seek out a good lawyer, but perhaps not one already associated with the family. There's need to hire the first lawyer you hear about, Kessler says. Lawyers have different styles. Just because a lawyer says he or she is a divorce lawyer doesn't make them the divorce lawyer that's best for you. Think about interviewing a few and see which one you feel the most comfortable with. Which one listens to you the best? Which one is more likely to help do what you want, not what they presume you want?
Almost two-thirds of minimum wage workers in the U.S. are women, according to the National Women's Law Center and, in 18 states, they're about to get raises.

These were things she would bring to my attention in the past and I would pay past-due balances, late fees and reconnection fees — regularly. I no longer offer to do that.

However, now they are just ignored and pile up without any action.
* Finally, consider accelerating elective medical procedures, dental work, and expenditures for vision care. For 2020, you can deduct medical expenses to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), assuming you itemize.

And it's why it is a mistake to look at long-term rates in isolation. What matters is their interaction with the policy rate. The fed funds/10-year spread has narrowed from an ultra-wide 365 basis points in 2010 to 120 basis points today, which still provides an incentive to depository institutions. The failure of long rates to match the Fed's rate increases means the Fed has less room to tighten policy, especially as the effects of balance-sheet reduction start to kick in.
The key takeaway from today's report is that there is no reason to panic about an excessively rapid cooling of the U.S. economy. While policy headwinds and tighter financial conditions will slow the pace of growth in 2019, there is a lot of gray area between a 3% growth economy and an outright recession, wrote Jake McRobie, an analyst at Oxford Economics.

We cannot educate people out of this crisis. Given the reality on the ground, the most sophisticated among us would be hard-pressed to master the complex machinery of personal finance. Yet instead of focusing on reforms to fix our train wreck of a retirement system, our policy makers are distracted by campaigns for partial stopgap measures. As lawmakers grapple with payday loans and usurious credit card interest rates, retirement security goes by the boards. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that the United States had a $28 trillion retirement savings gap in 2015—the largest in the world. By 2050, they project this will grow to $137 trillion. This is almost a $3 trillion annual increase—five times the annual U.S. defense budget.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% has been whiplashing in the past couple of weeks as trade-war related headlines, speculation over the Fed's policy stance and economic data have played havoc with market sentiment. In perhaps the most dramatic sign of what investors are having to contend with, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% went from having the worst start to a year since 2000 on Jan. 3 to posting year-to-date gains of more than 3% Wednesday.
Draghi offered no clear hint whether the ECB would suddenly stop its asset purchases, extend them, or phase them out gradually.

The 'need for immediacy' was becoming a cornerstone of the financial world before the pandemic, but in 2020 we experienced a decade's worth of digital transformation in just six months. The industry's focus on digital innovation is particularly critical as millennials and Generation Z increase their share of the personal finance marketplace. In fact, our recent consumer poll showed that more than half of these groups would prefer to make purchase decisions through digital experiences using virtual or augmented reality technology.
The grassroots movement behind the Green New Deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda.

In fact, it was the Fed's stated goal, as outlined by former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. Based on a concept known as the portfolio balance channel, Bernanke explained that, with the funds rate close to zero, the central bank buys long-term, risk-free assets, such as Treasuries, lowering the rates and encouraging investors to buy riskier, higher-yielding assets, such as stocks and corporate bonds. (Central bankers never quite explain the consequences when those trades unwind.)
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — A measure of small-business optimism showed an unusual split in December, as owners became more confident about sales at the same time they become more pessimistic about business conditions.
These redistributive shifts, taken individually, are quite small, and are not major factors in explaining quarterly returns. But unlike movements in market confidence, which tend to return to normal over a few quarters or years, these redistributive shifts are virtually permanent, allowing a sequence of small shifts to build up over time — with huge overall impact.

However, one study found that the laws can have unintended consequences: San Francisco employers hired fewer part-time workers after one such law went into effect, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
The spike down to a 4.6% unemployment rate seems to have sapped even the most diehard doves of any energy to continue concocting arguments to support the notion that significant labor market slack remains, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.
Since then, the CDC has said that the likely source of the outbreak appears to be leafy greens, but warned that officials have not settled on a specific type that is to blame. The CDC has said it is still investigating, and noted that genome sequencing on samples of the bacteria indicated the U.S. and Canadian outbreaks might be linked.
The Fed's range of policy choices is narrowing as we artificially try to manage the economy
The rule was proposed in September and its comment period was shortened to 30 days instead of 60 days, in what critics said was the Trump administration's effort to rush it through before the end of his term. It is expected to go into effect March 8, the Labor Department said in a news release.
At the moment, the Fed has a 2% inflation target. But inflation has been mostly below that level since 2012. This has led to soul searching among some policy-makers, and those who track their actions, for a new approach, Bullard noted.
When asked which areas of opportunity he sees for long-term investors, in light of all the turmoil, and especially China, Mann of Motley Fool Asset Management said: Contrarians do better long term because they are able to do things that are difficult in the moment.

The Fed raised interest rates in December for the second time in a decade and penciled in three moves this year. The next rate rise is now seen in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. However, after the strong wage growth seen in the December jobs report out on Friday economists are increasingly seeing a March hike as a possibility too.
All it took was one stellar economic data point to change the stock market's mood and punt the indexes higher. But even before the robust jobs numbers exorcised the demons, strategists had started to predict that the market is gearing up for a comeback given the depth of the recent selloff.
Nobody knows what a post-Nafta world would look like
March palladium US:PAH9 rose $3.80, or 0.3%, to $1,273.20 an ounce, with prices stretching streak of session gains to mark a fifth straight record settlement.
The changes to the statement were fairly modest, but the markets didn't really need much further encouragement. Fed-funds futures have risen almost continuously since last September and, at this stage, a March rate increase is pretty much fully priced in, said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a note.
We are now seeing a so-called volatility squeeze in the benchmark S&P 500 Index. In September, we had a similar situation, as noted by the arrows in this chart.

Appraisals can be a road bump in the home-buying process
A sustained rise in global inflation is likely only if there is a widespread shift to expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, said Kenningham. For now, there are few signs that policy makers outside the U.S. will unveil a major fiscal stimulus or that central banks will resort to more radical options…The upshot is that for much of the world, there is still a greater risk of inflation being too low than too high.
The Fed governor, who was widely touted as a possible Treasury secretary if Hillary Clinton had won the White House, said fiscal policy should focus instead on raising the growth rate of productivity and pushing more Americans off the sidelines and into the labor market.

About two-thirds of the participants had coverage through their employer or someone else's work. Another 20% had coverage through a form of government-provided insurance and 8% bought their own health insurance, the poll said.
The central bank raised its key lending rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, in line with what economists had expected following supportive economic data earlier this month. The Canadian dollar USDCAD, +0.06% fell against its U.S. counterpart immediately following the decision, but subsequently pared its decline. One dollar last bought C$1.2389, down from C$1.2435 late Tuesday.
The data could lead analysts to reassess their expectation for interest rate increases in 2018, which the Federal Reserve put at three.
Energy's impact: A year ago, energy price deflation was subtracting 1 percentage point from the headline inflation rate tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Kenningham noted. Energy prices are no longer deflationary, but narrowing the inflation watch strictly to energy's impact can be shortsighted.

Trump-inspired bulls are confident that the incoming president's policies will boost business confidence and unleash animal spirits, clearing the way for further upside.
Part of this is due to obvious technical problems in the design. While a 7% fall in the benchmark index lead to trading being halted for the whole day, in the U.S. a similar move would only trigger a 15- minute halt and full-day suspension needs moves of 20%.
The 2008 global financial crisis, coupled with the disappointing recovery in the advanced economies that followed, injected a new urgency into China's efforts to shift its growth model from one based on investment and external demand to one underpinned by domestic consumption. Navigating such a structural transition without causing a sharp decline in economic growth would be difficult for any country. The challenge is even greater for a country as large and complex as China, especially given today's environment of sluggish global growth.
Appraisals can be a road bump in the home-buying process
Also known as bifurcated appraisal, a hybrid appraisal is one in which a trained individual conducts the home visit and gathers the necessary data. That information is then relayed to an appraiser working from an office, who does the computations needed to ascertain the property's value. Many lenders already accept hybrid appraisals for some loans, and Fannie and Freddie have been exploring the process since 2018.
But add to the Trump effect all the attention paid to Dow 20,000, and we have the makings of a powerful illusion. On Nov. 10, 2016, two days after Donald J. Trump was elected, the Dow Jones average hit a new record high, and has since set 16 more daily records, all trumpeted by news media.

One of the biggest changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the installation of a flat 21% corporate federal income tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Before the TCJA, the maximum effective rate for profitable corporations was 35%. The Biden plan would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. This change would raise an estimated $1.1 trillion or so over 10 years.
The data signaled that Beijing's push to deleverage the country's economy will likely drive up borrowing costs and hurt economic growth, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
What folks need to understand is that the vast bulk of health care spending typically comes in the latter stages of life, the last two or three years. Don't make the mistake of assuming that what you spend on health care at age 65 or 70 is suggestive of what you'll spend at, say, 80 or 85, if you're fortunate enough to make it that far. Don't underestimate this.
Investors gorged on a heavy diet of policy commentary.
They own shares for one reason: to save for their retirement.
The grassroots movement behind the Green New Deal offers a ray of hope to the badly battered establishment: they should embrace it, flesh it out, and make it part of the progressive agenda. We need something positive to save us from the ugly wave of populism, nativism, and proto-fascism that is sweeping the world.
That hasn't deterred them completely, of course. In 2015, foreign companies represented about 16% of all U.S. public offerings, according to data from S&P Capital IQ, and a similar percentage in 2016 through November.

When taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry.

America's Changing Workforce: Independent and Gig Workers
This kind of case is pretty common, Slowiaczek says. He's seen many cases over the years where the second wife doesn't want the first wife or first wife's family to have anything. They want it all. Often times, the men don't want to fight with their new wives. But changing a life insurance policy that goes against the terms of the divorce decree would be asking for trouble. He would likely be in contempt of court, he adds, and that could get ugly. Sticking it to the ex-wife is one thing, he adds, but changing the terms of this policy would be trying to stick it to the children.
If a deal isn't reached, tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports are set to increase to 25% from 10% in early March. That would mark a serious escalation and add to the global economic headwinds facing both sides amid doubts over the durability of global growth.
The [summary of economic projections] could be enhanced by linking the variables for each participant's projection so that the public could see what each policymaker is projecting for growth, unemployment, and inflation, and what policy path he or she believes is appropriate given those projections.

Chopra said he's not surprised state legislators are eager to address student loan debt, given that they're often the first to hear about financial issues from their constituents.

Will I be upset if inflation moves to 2.5%? Probably not, given that the inflation dynamics suggest that it's not going to move quickly, Mester said.
Many people appear not to understand that inflation is a change in the units of measurement. Unfortunately, although the 2% inflation target is largely a feel-good policy, people tend to draw too much inspiration from it. Irving Fisher called this fixation on nominal price growth the money illusion in an eponymous 1928 book.
The Japanese government was thoroughly analyzing Trump's comments, the country's chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said Thursday, though he refrained from commenting directly on Trump's remarks.

Housing, which has been a reluctant participant throughout this business cycle after overplaying its hand in the previous one, has peaked.

By admitting that this is part of the debate at the ECB, he opened the door for a sudden end of asset purchases in eight months from now, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, in a note.

We have an office within enforcement with 12-15 people focused on this full-time which we did not have before Dodd-Frank. This program has been much more effective than the Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower provisions as a result. We are getting far more whistleblower reports now because of the Dodd-Frank anti-retaliation provisions but even more so because whistleblowers can get a percentage of the fine. I think that's been a bit of a game-changer. It encourages people to file a tip.

Finally, fluctuations in productivity play little role over any time frame.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the broad U.S. economy despite the bearish global stock environment, said Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, on Monday. In a speech in Atlanta, Lockhart said the global selloff in stocks begs the question of whether there are serious imbalances that make the broad economy vulnerable to foreign shocks.

The Atlanta Fed president said while fourth-quarter GDP growth could look rather weak and disappointing, he expects moderate growth and labor market improvement this year that will justify more interest-rate increases. Lockhart, who is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee, did not specify his view of the pace of tightening, saying there is no map and no predetermined schedule of increases.

It's complicated, but essentially, here's the deal: states—virtually all are required to balance their budgets each year—have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession. Given that Medicaid spending is usually a top—if not the top—source of spending, states can be expected to slash what they give to hospitals, physicians, nursing homes and other providers.
The Supreme Court may soon permit Trump to end President Barack Obama's DACA program and that would force reluctant Democrats to the table on broader reforms.

The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that Case and I created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms. But hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.
But it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now. It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the U.S., with its crushing unemployment of the time. Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.

So when it is time for us to sell, or even to stop buying, the response could be quite strong; there is every reason to expect a strong response. So there are a couple of ways to look at it. It is about $1.2 trillion in sales; you take 60 months, you get about $20 billion a month. That is a very doable thing, it sounds like, in a market where the norm by the middle of next year is $80 billion a month. Another way to look at it, though, is that it's not so much the sale, the duration; it's also unloading our short volatility position. When you turn and say to the market, 'I've got $1.2 trillion of these things,' it's not just $20 billion a month — it's the sight of the whole thing coming. And I think there is a pretty good chance that you could have quite a dynamic response in the market.

My husband and I married last year. This is a second marriage for each of us. I have two adult age children and he has two minor children. In his divorce decree it states that he shall maintain a $300,000 life insurance for his children as beneficiary until they reach the age of 23. However, on the actual policy he only has me listed as beneficiary. There is nothing indicating that this is left for his children should he pass prior to them reaching age 23. What would the legal liability be on this if he should pass before me?
Still, you wouldn't be the first second wife to want to claim a life insurance policy that was written for her husband's first family. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a 66-year-old man's ex-wife (rather than his widow) as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth over $124,000. In this case, he may not have wanted his ex-wife, who he divorced 10 years before his death, to claim his life insurance policy. But with or without a divorce decree, the document given to the insurance company had his ex-wife's name on it.
Gordon and Lesser hammered out a wish list of legislative fixes to help deal with the issues Gordon was seeing and the two worked with Adams to figure out which ones were feasible. Tackling Connecticut student loan borrowers' challenges from a financial regulation perspective, instead of simply a higher education policy perspective, was important, Lesser said, because student debt both creates personal financial challenges for borrowers and has consequences for the economy more broadly.

While financial stocks have accounted for the lion's share of the market's postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth.

The stock slumped 3.8% in afternoon trading; the stock was down about 2.0% just before the news. While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt, each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved, Foley said.

Peloton's stock has tumbled 31.6% year to date, while the S&P 500 undefined has gained 5.2%.

It's a difficult scenario: your child opens a new connected toy from grandma at Christmas, but you are not sure about its safety features. Brill said it's important to do research on the toy before allowing a child to use it, and be willing to get rid of the device if it doesn't offer proper protection. In rare cases he has even learned of toys being sent to children randomly in the mail under the guise of them winning a prize in order to hack into the family's network and obtain sensitive information. Never accept a toy, especially a connected one, from an unknown source.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Friday that monetary policy is in a good place and this will allow the central bank to take the time to assess the economy before making any more policy moves. Mester said the central bank could pause or even stop tightening now depending on inflation. She said that the two rate hikes penciled in by the central bank for 2019 could happen and that would be a good sign that the economy was performing well. Mester said she didn't support any slowdown in the pace of the shrinking of the balance sheet but said if the economy weakened markedly that a change was possible. Pressed on whether she supported further rate hikes, Mester said she didn't have to vote now and would wait for more information.

One has to wonder if the yield curve would be as good an indicator this time around because of the Fed's balance-sheet dynamics. At $10 billion in monthly balance-sheet runoffs, the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's $4.4 trillion balance sheet is not a big deal today. The question is: At what run-off rate would that begin to affect the Treasury market more aggressively — $20 billion, $30 billion or $50 billion?

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the broad U.S. economy despite the bearish global stock environment, said Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, on Monday. In a speech in Atlanta, Lockhart said the global selloff in stocks begs the question of whether there are serious imbalances that make the broad economy vulnerable to foreign shocks. I don't see that kind of connection in current circumstances, Lockhart said. The Atlanta Fed president said while fourth-quarter GDP growth could look rather weak and disappointing, he expects moderate growth and labor market improvement this year that will justify more interest-rate increases. Lockhart, who is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee, did not specify his view of the pace of tightening, saying there is no map and no predetermined schedule of increases.

But the experience hasn't turned him away from the profession. In fact, for both Evatt and Carrillo, watching students and teachers struggle with remote and modified in-person instruction has had the opposite effect.
Stein says she will be a senior research fellow at the Center on Innovation at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, and will also be teaching a seminar starting soon at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
I have an issue with some of their other tactics, Cook added, referring to a New York Times report that the chip maker used an opposition research firm to spread what he called fake news about potentially running for president in 2020, apparently to chill his relationship with the Trump administration. This is stuff that should be beneath companies. This is not how things should operate, he said.
Chinese authorities have suspended a policy they just implemented on Monday after it caused turbulence in the stock markets. Analysts, however, aren't convinced Friday's session will be any rosier. See full story.
The Internal Revenue Service has deposited all the stimulus money into his account, and he will not share it with me. I finally started working this past October, and this most current stimulus check went to him again! Why did I not receive my own?
The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming, and the national home price index that Case and I created is still 16% below its 2006 peak in real terms. But hardly anyone focuses on these inflation-corrected numbers.
Stein: Yes, it's just unbelievable. I have pushed in every possible way that I could as just a commissioner, since the chairman sets the agenda and decides how rulemaking resources are allocated. That's been very frustrating.
Economists at Economy.com saw no sense of urgency in the minutes to raise interest rates again. They saw widespread uncertainty among Fed officials about the outlook.
There are also signs that young people, in particular, will continue spending in 2019. Despite reporting better financial habits, the latest report noted some concerning trends. Only 50% of people listed money management as a New Year's resolution they're most likely to keep, down from 60% last year. What's more, the desire to better manage their money and put more money aside for a rainy day dropped for all respondents to 37% this year from 42% in 2017.
Those sound like impossible levels, but you just have to dream a little bigger, dear readers.
The email highlights a relationship well understood in the higher education universe, but little discussed in the mainstream. Broadly, a college's success at reeling in philanthropy can impact its prestige.

Taxpayers reporting income in those ranges would see their marginal tax rate rise from 28% under current policy to 33% under the plan Trump proposed during his campaign. (Your marginal tax rate is the amount of tax paid on your next dollar of income, as you move into a higher tax bracket. It is not your overall, or effective, tax rate, which is typically lower.)
At this point, it is wise to remember the lessons of the 2008 market correction:
Since touching a five-month high on Nov. 4, volatility has trended lower as U.S. stocks embarked on a torrid rally that took the Dow to within a hair's breadth of the 20,000 milestone last week. But stocks have struggled to build on their gains this week, and some Wall Street analysts are saying that the inauguration could mark a near-term top.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +3.84% , Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +3.71% and Citigroup Inc. C, +2.64% are scheduled to report results at the end of the week.

The Boston Fed President, who is not a voting member of the Fed policy-making committee this year, forecast that the Fed would meet its twin goals of low unemployment and a 2% annual rate of inflation by the end of the year.
In Phase II, we hope to expand Ohiocrypto.com to include individual personal taxes, and also to expand beyond just bitcoin and include other cryptocurrencies as well, he said. We thought the most intuitive and responsible way to begin this initiative, because it's the first time it's ever been done in America, is to start it off right — and that is by only allowing businesses to pay with bitcoin, and expand it out from there.
British blue-chips remained in the red while the broader European equity market SXXP, +0.40% briefly turned positive after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank continues to stand ready to extend stimulus measures for the eurozone economy, if needed.
There is a good deal of room for the ETF to rally from its current level near $23.35, Kahn adds. The level that gold-stock bulls need to target is around $31.50, where the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF peaked in mid-2016.
Other countries have had to do this — Australia and New Zealand, for example, when in the 1970s the U.K. progressively scaled back its food imports from them under pressure from the European Economic Community. The British may be instinctively suspicious of grand visions; but some sort of framework of thought is necessary.
Malaysia's index also fell 0.8% to reverse the sharp adjustment higher at the end of Friday's trading. Big end-of-session gains of some 10% seen in the likes of Sime Darby Plantation and KLCC Property were largely reversed Tuesday.
Should the Fed, with malice aforethought, invert the curve, I am confident this time will not be different in terms of the economic outcome. The only thing we can hope is that the Fed's response is different.
Ultimately, Evermore said lawmakers are likely to take significant action to make permanent and serious reform to unemployment insurance programs. That could involve introducing legislation that increases the minimum amount of benefits and the number of weeks of benefits individuals can qualify for in their respective states.
From the beginning of 2018 to mid-December, 30-year fixed mortgage rates went up a little less than three-quarters of a percentage point, to around 4.75%. Forecasters expect mortgage rates to rise again in 2019 — but at a slower pace.
A realistic first step would be to ditch any lingering nostalgic belief that the U.K. has a special relationship with the U.S. The U.K. is, of course, able to wield some influence, from time to time, in specific areas; but there is no escaping the basic fact that the U.K. oday accounts for just 2.5% of global gross domestic product.
Intent-wise it's a good thing, he said of the new laws. But after reading the Connecticut statute, their new servicing license, I'm not really sure it's going to do anything. I applaud the effort and let's see it run its course.
Of course, the report isn't the first to draw a connection between state disinvestment in higher education and rising tuition or growing student debt. But Allison hopes that arming residents with information about how their state is treating its public colleges and universities and how that affects their pocketbooks may encourage students, their parents and others to ask their lawmakers to better fund their higher education institutions.

Next up on the prepayment menu are state and local income and property taxes that are due early next year. Prepaying those bills before year-end can decrease your 2020 federal income tax bill, because your itemized deductions total will be that much higher. However, the TCJA decreased the maximum amount you can deduct for state and local taxes to $10,000 or $5,000 if you use married filing separate status. So, beware of that limitation.
The other missteps include the trade battle with China, which has undercut the benefits of the corporate tax cuts, and the Federal Reserve's belief that the effect on term yields from the pace of [its balance-sheet reduction] was somehow immune to a doubling of the budget deficit, he said.
People's feelings about immigration and their own finances are often connected, experts say. The stock market has been on a rollercoaster ride, spooking and confusing investors. Political tensions with China are fragile and unpredictable. There's growing concerns among business leaders of a recession in 2019. And yet Americans say they feel better about key aspects of their lives than they did a year ago, according to last month's Allianz Life survey.

Meanwhile, Antoinette Kunda feels like all her hard work goes largely unrecorded by economists. The government doesn't have a freaking clue about the work that I do, she said.
The Labor Department reported that 156,000 jobs were added in December to cap off the sixth straight year in which the economy created more than 2 million new jobs. Economists polled by MarketWatch had predicted a 180,000 increase in new nonfarm jobs. The unemployment rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6%.

In Japan, too: Capital Economics expects inflation in Japan to stay below 2% for most of the next two years.

Continuing a multiyear trend, new single-family home size decreased during the third quarter of 2018, wrote Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, in a November blog post. New home size has been falling over the last three years due to an incremental move to additional entry-level home construction.
Ever since the Great Recession, policy makers have been searching for easy ways to accelerate job growth. One answer that both Republicans and Democrats agreed on was encouraging the formation of new businesses by giving them access to capital through the stock market, under the assumption that new companies create most of the new jobs. And so the JOBS Act was passed, which makes it easier for new corporations to go public by selling shares to the public.
Instead, some Fed officials said they were on the lookout for signs of markets overheating, an indication the Fed was moving too slow.

If selling some losers would cause your 2020 capital losses to exceed your 2020 capital gains, the result would be a net capital loss for the year. No problem. That net capital loss can be used to shelter up to $3,000 of 2020 income from salaries, bonuses, self-employment income, interest income, royalties, and whatever else ($1,500 if you use married filing separate status). Any excess net capital loss is carried forward to next year and beyond.

In the U.S., the combination of Trump and a succession of new asset-price records — call it Trump-squared — has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism. For those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception, one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.

But the debate sparked by the Democrat from New York also revealed some misunderstandings about how America's tax system works.
Why is the yield curve shrinking? Simply put, Federal Reserve policy (see chart). The two-year note is most sensitive to Fed policy and heavily correlated to the federal funds rate, as both are deemed to be short-term, risk-free rates. If the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% , which is more sensitive to economic growth and inflation, does not rise as much as the yield on the two-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , the yield curve shrinks (see chart).

The most prominent consumer tech company, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% , already signaled that it will not boost revenue growth with its huge earnings warning earlier this month, when Apple said it expects a massive revenue shortfall of billions of dollars in its normally robust December quarter. Apple cited a big slowdown in China for the iPhone's slowing demand, due in part to the continuing trade war between the U.S. and China. It's also highly likely that Apple's high-end pricing model has hit a limit in China, where the average annual income was around $11,000 in 2017.
Global equities were weaker with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking 400 points at its low. Treasurys remained under pressure, with the yield on the 10-year note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% pushing back above 2.7%. Yields rise as debt prices fall.
2. As longevity rises, many policy experts contend that people's working lives will also lengthen. But this argument assumes all workers have experienced the same increase in life expectancy—without factoring in socioeconomic status. Does a Uniform Retirement Age Make Sense?, just released by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, examines data on mortality and income. The brief finds that life expectancies for low socioeconomic status individuals have been improving more slowly than for individuals in a higher socioeconomic bracket in recent decades, causing the life expectancy gap to grow.

Note carefully that even if the MY ratio's forecast turns out to be right, it applies to the longer-term: The stock market should be materially higher in 10 to 15 years' time. The ratio doesn't have any ability to predict the stock market's shorter-term gyrations. So it would not be inconsistent with its forecast of a much higher stock market in the 2030s for equities to suffer a number of cyclical bear markets along the way.
The MY ratio isn't a perfect stock market forecaster, and the period since 2000 is a case in point. After all, since the ratio has steadily declined since then, the stock market should be a lot lower today than then.

Medicare Parts A and B do not pay for all health care expenses. Coverage gaps include copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. So you may want to buy a so-called Medigap policy, which is private supplemental insurance that's intended to cover some or all of the gaps.

Horowitz downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral, saying the current stock valuation implies revenue growth of 18% off the 2016 base, while the FactSet revenue consensus for 2017 implies 7.6% growth. While we expect [Goldman] to see improved trading revenues going forward, the path is relatively uncertain and the bar is relatively high, Horowitz wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, Horowitz raised his stock price target to $225, which is 6.4% below current levels, from $200. The stock has rocketed 32% since the election, on optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's policy promises to slash regulation and boost fiscal stimulus, which would boost longer-term Treasury yields. In comparison, the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +0.52% has climbed 17% since the election while the Dow has gained 8.4%.

It's absurd that her decision to teach art to children at a Christian school, and the school's religious beliefs, are under attack, Brooks told HuffPo in a statement.
One of the challenges in the alternative energy space is how well the stocks have been doing — many companies favored by analysts and investors have gotten well-ahead of consensus price targets.
But this often means greater income instability and losing access to benefits such as employer-sponsored retirement plans. Workers are much more likely to save if their employer provides a retirement plan. More recently, new state-facilitated retirement savings programs as well as new low-cost, simplified mobile fintech (financial technology) platforms offer the potential for greater access to ways to save for gig employers and workers.

Slowiaczek is cautious about taking on clients who refer to him as a pit bull or a shark. Sometimes, people might say that because we're tough, he says, but if you go in with all guns blazing and start in a mean, aggressive manner, you automatically create a very adversarial situation. That could increase the cost of the divorce — which could vary between $25,000 to $100,000, depending on the assets involved, the lawyer's fees and where you live — by double or even triple, he says. Be courteous and respectful. The key is to avoid escalation.

Investors pushed yields higher on the expectation that Trump's proposed policies—including stiffer trade barriers, a massive infrastructure bill and deregulation—would boost growth and wages, causing consumer-price inflation to rise more aggressively.
The Fed raised interest rates in December for the second time in a decade and penciled in three moves this year. The next rate rise is now seen in June, according to the CME FedWatch tool. However, after the strong wage growth seen in the December jobs report out on Friday economists are increasingly seeing a March hike as a possibility too.
What folks need to understand is that the vast bulk of health care spending typically comes in the latter stages of life, the last two or three years. Don't make the mistake of assuming that what you spend on health care at age 65 or 70 is suggestive of what you'll spend at, say, 80 or 85, if you're fortunate enough to make it that far. Don't underestimate this.
America's Powerball champs live in its tiniest state.
While a tiny elite seems to have done very well, large swaths of the population have fallen out of the middle class and plunged into a new world of vulnerability and insecurity. Even leaders in countries with low but increasing inequality have felt their public's wrath.
My husband and I grew up dirt poor — I mean he literally had holes in the floor where you could see the dirt. I was fairly better off, my single mother had been expected to marry and have no need for understanding how things like credit worked (her father was a loan officer; it was a different time). At times, we had a little money and, at other times, we ate at the local churches.

Data Thursday showed that manufacturing activity in the Philadelphia region expanded at the fastest pace in more than two years in January, and the number of workers being laid off each week has plunged again back to a more-than-40-year low.
Economists have debated how effective the New Deal was — its spending was probably too low and not sustained enough to generate the kind of recovery the economy needed. Nonetheless, it left a lasting legacy by transforming the country at a crucial time.
There are unknowns, of course. For one, President-elect Donald Trump's expected fiscal-stimulus plans, still light on details, could put further upward pressure on wages and prices.
The distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and accompanying hopes of a return to economic normality so far have not done much to lift Treasury yields, as bond buying by the Federal Reserve has been more than able to offset any bearish pressure associated with recovering economic growth and rising inflation expectations.
The U.S. set a fresh record for hospitalizations with the coronavirus-borne illness COVID-19 on Wednesday, as experts said the new, far more infectious variant makes it even more crucial to get the nation's so-far underwhelming vaccine program on track.
A sudden, sharp decline by the yuan this week appeared to have far-reaching consequences for global equity markets, as indexes from Asia to North America post serious losses.

Outside of the U.S., British Prime Minister Theresa May said Tuesday that the U.K. wants a clean break from the European Union, including leaving the so-called single market and customs union, which would allow the country to exercise tighter controls over its borders.
But what about more particular policy points? If you look at stock market action Jan. 6, it is clear that investors expect Biden and Congress to do a lot for companies producing clean energy, or developing technology and services to enable other companies to do so.
Changes proposed by the Department of Labor on Dec. 5 would allow employers to legally pocket tips that servers earn at restaurants. The change, which would repeal part of a 2011 ruling that said employers could not pocket their workers' tips, is meant to level a growing disparity between what tipped employees like servers earn compared with back-of-house employees like cooks. After the changes, employers could take all tips earned by servers and redistribute them to workers that are not tipped.
The rules she appeared to be referring to, called 10 FAM 180, come from the Department of State and are part of an official foreign affairs manual and handbook.
Mr Draghi poured cold water on the idea of a rate rise this year and repeatedly said rates would be on hold until 'well past' the end of QE. The ECB also has concerns about the stronger euro. Combined, these probably outweigh the hawkish words on accelerating growth and Mr. Draghi rowing back a bit on his assertion that there would be no 'sudden end' to QE, said economists at HSBC.
Yes. Wall Street has enormous economic and political power. Yes. Wall Street makes huge campaign contributions, they have thousands of lobbyists and they provide very generous speaking fees to those who go before them.

In addition, the sectors that are impacted by low interest rates have led the recovery.
An increase in wage growth, however, provided support for the argument that the employment market remains on a solid footing. Average hourly wages jumped 0.4% to $26 last month, while hourly pay increased 2.9% from December 2015 to December 2016, marking the fastest 12-month increase since a recovery that began in mid-2009.
Wall Street trading over the past several days has been subdued as investors await signs that the stock-market rally that followed President-elect Donald Trump's November election victory, supported by his campaign promises to increase fiscal spending, cut taxes and roll back regulations, is based in reality and underpinned by solid corporate quarterly results.

Friday's rally meant that none of the equity indexes have posted a down day so far in 2018. For the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, it was the fourth straight closing record, while the Dow carved out its third in a row. The broad-market benchmark has closed at a record on the first four trading days of the new year, the first time it has done so since 1964, according to WSJ Market Data Group.
To the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. In particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the NIIT bites. Ouch.
What the Fed controls is the overnight interbank lending rate, known as the federal funds rate, by buying or selling Treasury securities to adjust the supply of reserves in the banking system. (The Fed's program of paying interest on excess reserves is irrelevant for purposes of this discussion.)

As mentioned before, 2019 will remain a seller's market, where would-be buyers outnumber the supply of homes they can afford. But that doesn't mean home sellers can expect bidding wars from desperate buyers.
It would take a massive selloff to make these options profitable, Bier said.
Many are hoping that when Donald Trump—one of the most divisive U.S. presidents in the past century or more—leaves office, the historically elevated levels of partisanship in U.S. politics will at least begin to subside. But the opposite is vastly more likely.
Here's what we found: At short-term horizons of one-quarter to several years, market confidence shocks are dominant, explaining nearly all fluctuations. Essentially, short-run swings in stock prices are simply out of proportion to the movements in the underlying cash flows, ruling out the other two explanations.
Others have questioned whether the shutdown itself would be enough to affect underlying economic trends.
In particular, experts pointed out a number of concerns tied to appraisal waivers, one of the proposals the FHFA is exploring. The problem with a waiver is you don't know what you don't know, said Joan Trice, CEO of the Collateral Risk Network, an organizer of appraisers and risk managers. You didn't send an appraiser into that house. How do you know they didn't gut it and run out of money? You have no idea.
The banking play looks set to go lower, and short positions in U.S. markets are preferred, although I am not expecting a strong move lower, Weston writes.
Additionally, by failing to anchor decisions around higher education and financing to outcomes and job market data, current structures are further exacerbating the skills gap plaguing the U.S. economy. Specifically, labor shortages have become a chronic problem in key economic sectors, including transportation, skilled trades, cybersecurity/IT, education, and healthcare.
That doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. Stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. And random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. But once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.

Politics and the outbreak of civil discord in Washington dictated Wednesday's trading action as Trump supporters breached the Capitol complex and fought with police, disrupting a joint session of Congress that had just begun the process of certifying, state by state, the results of the Nov. 3 presidential election in the wake of a divisive election, with flames having been fanned in the two months since Election Day by claims of fraudulent conduct that have met with no success in dozens of state and federal courts.
Though O'Connor struck down the Affordable Care Act, he recently ruled that his decision wouldn't take effect during the case's appeal. Many everyday Americans would otherwise face great uncertainty, the judge wrote.
But today's selloff could be attributed to the perceived lack of leadership in Washington, he said, as the shutdown underscores what could be a year of increased policy uncertainty, including questions surrounding U.S. trade policy.
Germany's economy grew by 2.2% in 2017, according to a preliminary estimate from the country's Destatis agency. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal projected slightly higher growth of 2.3%.

This return to growth won't require the Fed to take its foot off the gas because the economy will still be far from our employment and inflation goals, Mester said.
The Shanghai Composite Index has greatly outperformed the S&P 500 during this two-year period, despite the painful volatility.

Fed President of Cleveland Loretta Mester told CNBC on Friday that the jobs report was strong and that she could foresee three or four rate increases in 2018. I think we're basically at maximum employment from the view of monetary policy, she said.
Higher inflation and anticipation of Fed hiking have underpinned selling in bonds, lifting yields from a low in July of 1.36% to a high last month of about 2.6%. A plot of projections for future rate hikes by Fed members released last month, implies three rate increases in 2017.

Millennials, the generation born between the early 1980s and the mid-to-late 1990s, make up about one-third of today's U.S. workforce. They are better educated than previous generations, with a greater proportion of them possessing a college degree. Because they have lived through the Great Recession, they are more risk averse. They are also more likely to begin to save earlier in their careers.

While the pandemic took millions of livelihoods and tens of thousands of lives across the globe last year, many of the world's wealthiest people managed to get richer. The 500 richest people in the world added a record $1.8 trillion to their combined net worth last year. And the Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies reported that the 651 U.S. billionaires saw their collective wealth grow by more than $1 trillion over nine months.
It is said that the stock market SPX, -0.16% is not the economy, and that's true. But the stock market does convey certain information and expectations about things that affect the economy, and are affected by it, such as corporate earnings. And those profit expectations have been tempered after the spectacular, double-digit gains in 2018. (Year-over-year comparisons become more challenging next year.)

 The Dow is up only 19% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms since 2000. A 19% increase in 17 years is underwhelming. 
The FHFA is also exploring the value of appraisal waivers. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, federal regulators and housing authorities, along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have relaxed requirements for appraisals on certain loans. While most new loans backed by Fannie and Freddie during the COVID emergency featured traditional appraisals these flexibilities provide a way to protect the health and safety of industry participants, comply with local restrictions throughout the country, and continue to provide liquidity and stability to the market. One of the considerations the FHFA is exploring is whether to allow more permanent waivers for appraisals.
Net-worth poverty rates among Black households with children rose from 46% in 2001 to 51% in 2007 and kept inching upward until 2013, after which they decreased slightly. In white households they increased from 24% to 30% during the Great Recession, but have decreased since then, the authors wrote. The increase in net-worth poverty for Black households, when combined with the null increase for white households, has widened the racial gap over time, they wrote.
The question remains: Is putting America back to work sooner rather than later a Sisyphean task, the equivalent of rolling a rock perpetually uphill while more people die of COVID-19? Or does Sisyphus's task involve waiting while millions more people lose their livelihoods, only to find themselves among the long-term unemployed or underemployed, eventually succumbing to substance abuse and chronic depression, or worse?
We entered 2020 on the brink of a trust crisis, as traditional institutions from mainstream media to the government became divisive sources and many flocked to social media circles to serve as their most relied upon source for financial guidance. In fact, during the prosperous decade that preceded 2020, the rise of crowdsourcing meant many of us not only used recommendations from strangers to decide where to eat or what movie to see, it also determined our biggest financial decisions.
It's easy enough to argue why bond yields should rise. The Treasury Department will unload a deluge of issuance this year, major central banks are set to start a long-awaited shift away from easy money policies and inflation expectations have begun to trickle higher thanks to tight labor markets.

Furthermore, investors seem to be ignoring the risk associated with Trump's interest in negotiating better trade deals. The only way he can do this is to threaten a trade war with China and within NAFTA. If he does that, he needs those countries to believe that he is capable, and willing, to initiate a trade war for them to come to the table and renegotiate existing deals, or to make concessions. And that's the only way he will come out of those negotiations a winner.
At this point, it is wise to remember the lessons of the 2008 market correction:
Markets remain fragile and safe havens remain bid. The USD (U.S. dollar) will have a hard time selling off too dramatically as its attraction as both a safe haven and a high yielder will matter and spark further demand for USD assets, said Brad Bechtel, analyst at Jefferies, in a note.
Off the FTSE 100, Premier Oil PLC PMO, -3.85% said Wednesday trading of its shares have been temporarily suspended pending an announcement of a potential acquisition of assets.

But there may also be a broader explanation for continued disinvestment in higher education, which is that it's easy for policy makers to put funding for colleges and universities on the chopping block because constituents don't get as agitated by the cuts as they would about say, a tax increase, Allison said.
The recent selloff in Treasurys, and the accompany rally in risk assets like stocks and crude oil, has moderated somewhat as Wall Street awaits further details on Trump's policy proposals and weigh its potential impact on the overall economy. Trump's inauguration is set for Jan. 20.
German biotechnology company BioNTech BNTX, -1.33% joined its partner Pfizer PFE, -0.11% in saying there is no evidence that delaying the second inoculation of their coronavirus vaccine would be effective beyond three weeks, a move the U.K. has made and Germany is considering, but one that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has resisted. There is also concern vaccines won't be effective against the so-called South African variant of the virus.
Elliott said the rise in animal passengers reflects a larger shift in how people view their pets — one airlines are struggling to combat.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest suggested Tuesday that a border tax on imported cars, backed earlier in the day by President-elect Donald Trump, would be the worst policy for the U.S. economy and consumers.
Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.
Treasurys, which tend to serve as a haven during periods of unrest and uncertainty, instead saw prices fall, driving up yields. The 10-year yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.663% rose 8.6 basis points to 1.041%, finishing above the 1% level for the first time in nine months.
Now, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.

Nalani and Sarina, who grew up in New Jersey and have performed for Bruce Springsteen, heard stories of their friends' challenges, including struggling to get a job without experience and moving from city to city chasing unpaid internships until they couldn't afford to anymore. But it wasn't until they read statistics on what their friends were facing during the lead up to the song's release that they began to understand the severity of what kids after college have to go through.

Because the capital account reflects the flow of money across borders, it's likely that the yuan will continue to move in the same direction as the capital account, Anderson said.
With that in mind, it's time to consider moves that will lower your 2020 tax bill, and hopefully position you for tax savings in future years too.
That will require the Democrats to shelve their tropism for higher taxes on upper-income Americans and for the president to give up on yet more budget-busting tax cuts. Alternatively, both sides could go after the carried interest tax break for Wall Street's financial engineers — those levy lower capital gains tax rates on income that should rightly be classified as wage income.
Even with these ups and downs, Mester said Fed policy is in the right place.

Some analysts argue the balance sheet runoff is damaging financial markets.
Consumer price inflation is set to rise in most advanced economies, with the U.S. rate likely to reach around 3% by the middle of this year and creep higher in 2018, Capital Economics projected. The Fed prefers inflation to run around 2% give or take, and its favorite inflation gauge, the PCE reading carved out of the GDP report, actually decelerated late in 2016.

Still, the shutdown could impact some borrowers trying to manage their debt. Borrowers who want to take advantage of the government's income-driven repayment plans, which allow them to pay off their debt as a percentage of their income, need to show proof of income to their student loan servicer. They also need to recertify their income every year to stay on the plans.

Stock markets in China rallied Friday, after news of the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks, new stimulus measures from China's central bank, as well as a better-than-expected report on the Chinese services sector.
The start of trading in the New Year has been ugly as companies begin to sound the earnings alarm, an obvious impact of the trade war. While we do expect a decrease in overall profits, it is obvious that multinationals will bear the brunt of the trade war as earnings miss their forecast, wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, in a research note.
Monday's moves mean that fundamentals began to matter again, said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. A focus on fundamentals is expected to intensify in 2016 because the crutch of central bank policy, particularly from the [Federal Reserve], is beginning to break, he said.
The stock market is off to a rocky start this year, as the Dow industrials continued to slide on Thursday and touched a three-month low.
The more people expect something, the less likely it is to happen, Ziedins writes. The slide in stocks could subside, and then the rally could resume after Friday's swearing-in ceremony, he says.
More than a month later, I was contacted by a company representative agreeing to pay me $800: $700 for the EU Regulation 261/2004, $50 for my taxi home after my first canceled flight, and $50 for food I ate at the airport. The $800 I received minus the $100 in costs incurred at the airport and $260 in money I lost on the Airbnb left me with $440 in profit from my failed Paris trip. I may use that money toward planning another vacation to Europe in the new year. And what airline will I chose? Despite all the delays — Norwegian.

Increasing taxes on earned income wouldn't necessarily hit the rich where it hurts the most.
I was back to Square 1, and my flight, once again, was rescheduled for the next day. Already three days late to the Airbnb I had paid for in Paris, I decided to give up, for now, on my dream of seeing the City of Light. I called the airline to cancel my flight, and my credit card was immediately refunded the $600 one-way flight — as well as my $350 original flight, essentially erasing my dumb financial mistake of arriving to the airport late, because they were both on the same ticket.

Students who work in their intended fields while in college tend to reap the most benefit out of their work, but even those who work at what we think of as more traditional college student jobs in, say, a cafeteria or at the library's front desk can benefit too, Kelchen said. It shows that you have some prior experience working for somebody else, working with others and basic things like punctuality. To a certain extent, a college degree can signal those skills as well, he said.

Republicans controlled 50 seats in the Senate following November's elections and would have remained the majority party in the 100-seat chamber with just one win in Georgia.

Wilson believes the market is too damaged and there is too much resistance for stocks to climb straight up. He also noted that financial conditions continue to deteriorate despite the Fed's more dovish tone, and without the central bank backing off from its tighter policy regime, it will be tough for the market to support a rally above 2,600-2,650.
February gold US:GCG9 fell by $4.60, or 0.4%, to settle at $1,287.40 an ounce after trading as high as $1,298.

As college costs have jumped over the past few decades, student debt has gone from a relatively niche and manageable personal finance issue to a common American experience. And politicians, particularly a younger crop of lawmakers who have personal experience with student debt, are starting to notice.
Treasury yields fell Thursday in volatile trading after investors gave a dovish reading of European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's remarks.
Spano expects a choppy year with the S&P 500 reaching as high as 4,000 — a shiny round numbered object, as he calls it — but the index also falling to 3,000 or even lower. Besides consolidate, markets also need to separate out the struggling zombies, companies that can't meet their debt-servicing costs from profits, which could account for up to 40% of the S&P 500.
The difference between the 10-year Treasury note's yield and the two-year Treasury note's yield has now shrunk to 50 basis points. This is the definition of a shrinking yield curve slope, which is completely normal in a mature economic expansion (see chart).
Miners on the move: Mining shares were moving lower as most metals prices fell, with gold US:GCG7 down about 1% and silver US:SIH7 losing 2%. The moves for metals came as the dollar DXY, +0.41% rose, following Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen's comment that the central bank expects a few interest rate hikes a year through the end of 2019. A strong buck can make dollar-denominated metals more expensive for holders of other currencies.

At the same time, China still has some $3.33 trillion of foreign reserves to support the yuan USDCNH, +0.31% yet it will be wary of using them up too aggressively as this contracts domestic liquidity. Authorities would be reluctant to tighten domestic monetary conditions excessively as this could hurt the property market. This remains pivotal, with estimates by analysts in the past that some 50% of banking collateral is related to real estate.

Centering policy efforts solely on income poverty won't fully address the problems these families face, the authors argued. They suggested pro-wealth accumulation strategies such as expanding child-care or housing subsidies to free up net income and relaxing safety-net programs' asset tests.

So how likely or imminent is a U.S. recession? Not very. It's possible that an out-of-nowhere shock could tip a slow-growing economy into negative territory. But real recession, not just an arithmetic decline in real gross domestic product, such as the ones that occurred in the first quarter of 2011 and 2015, requires some heavy lifting.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The market's expectation that the Federal Reserve will only raise interest rates twice in 2016 are too low, said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer on Wednesday. We think they're too low, Fischer said in an interview with CNBC. The Fed's own forecast in its dot plot' are for four rate hikes this year. Fischer said this was more in the ballpark. He added that policy is not on automatic pilot. We don't know enough now to know how many [rate hikes] there will be, Fischer said, because the Fed will have to respond to events.
Under current law, the federal income tax basis of an inherited capital-gain asset is stepped up fair market value as of the decedent's date of death. So, if heirs sell inherited capital-gain assets, they only owe federal capital gains tax on the post-death appreciation, if any. This provision can be a huge tax-saver for greatly-appreciated inherited assets — such as personal residences that were acquired many years ago for next to nothing and are now worth millions. The Biden plan would eliminate this tax-saving provision.

Economists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. And there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. One would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. That means valuations, will, on average, be higher. So the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? And obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. So those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. But I would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.

As for savings, the overall picture is not as healthy as it may seem for Americans. The median U.S. household currently holds just $11,700 in savings, according to an analysis released last August of Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data by personal-finance site Magnify Money. The bottom 20% by income have no savings and the second lowest 20% income earners have $26,450 saved. (Median balances, the midpoint value, are lower than the average savings rates.)
In a discussion with reporters, Mester noted that the Fed agreed in December that asset purchases would continue until there is substantial progress in meeting its twin goals of low unemployment and a 2% annual inflation rate.
While those numbers show the struggle of diversification in 2015, that long-term picture shows why investors shouldn't be spooked out of the practice.
A financial crisis accompanying a recession introduces a new prototype and limits the effectiveness of the traditional cure. Once a boom goes bust, monetary and fiscal policy become less effective because of necessary deleveraging, even though ultra-low interest rates are an incentive to borrow and spend. The pattern of a deep recession followed by a sharp, swift rebound becomes inoperative, as the subdued recovery from the 2007-2009 recession made clear.
Bloomberg notes that Bezos, who had been the world's richest person since 2017, would still hold a sizable lead over Musk if it weren't for his divorce from MacKenzie Scott in 2019, which gave his ex-wife 25% of his Amazon stake. What's more, Bezos also donated Amazon shares worth about $680 million in November.
The market doesn't move in a straight line: In case you haven't noticed yet, stock prices move up and down — and that's normal. Investors have come up with numerous ways to say just that.

The review of business always carries the risk of unexpected findings, yet the magnitude of the $6.2 billion charge is far more staggering than the $3 billion that the market anticipated, research firm Audit Analytics wrote in a note to subscribers.
Back in 2017, the gulf between the Fed and Wall Street over the appropriate level of interest rates seemed impossible to close. Analysts accused the central bank of risking a policy misstep if it hiked rates when inflation readings persisted below its 2% target. Policymakers including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen stuck to the script that a lack of price pressures would prove fleeting.

In the U.S., the combination of Trump and a succession of new asset-price records — call it Trump-squared — has been sustaining the illusion underpinning current market optimism. For those who are not too stressed from having taken extreme positions in the markets, it will be interesting (if not profitable) to observe how the illusion morphs into a new perception, one that implies very different levels for speculative markets.

1.Every worker owns a portable retirement saving account. However long they work before retirement, employees maintain total control over a government guaranteed account. It is funded by a minimum 3% of the employee's salary—half contributed by the worker, half by the employer.

But Grindal, in an interview, argued that we shouldn't be too quick to declare the MY ratio a failure.

The headline number was weaker and the revisions weren't great, Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said of the jobs report and the lower wage growth number. The Phillips curve is still missing in action. But I think to say that the Fed made a policy error in December is too strong. For all its weakness, the report was still far from catastrophe.

Most Democrats say extending the wall is an ineffective and expensive measure, stressing that most alleged immigration policy abuse comes from immigrants who overstay their legal permissions. Some have pointed to the vulnerabilities of a wall without boosting security technology or manpower; others argue that Trump is clinging to a vanity campaign promise whose funding plans have shifted. The White House's plan was seen as particularly vulnerable in a now Democrat-controlled House.
Consumer advocates have argued for years that the student loan servicing industry is in need of reform. They cite troubling practices they say are keeping borrowers from paying back their loans. In a September report from the CFPB, borrowers complained that servicers failed to post payments on time or applied payments to the interest of loans instead of to the principal, allowing additional interest to accrue.

False advertising is frustrating and a profile on a dating site is, in essence, an advertisement of you, said Abby Rodman, a psychotherapist in Boston. Too much airbrushing causes problems. If you're creating a 'false advertisement' of yourself online through airbrushing and other means, the only outcomes are frustration for you — when your date isn't interested in the real you — and annoyance for the other person who invested their time with a you who doesn't truly exist.

And a small company with balance-sheet problems can't do what the big boys do — go back to markets and do a rights issue. That ultimately leads to a higher bankruptcy risk and bigger risks for the economy, which gets harder to ignore. Looking at the Fed's reversal in policy it seems far more connected to what's going on in credit markets and in terms of weakening companies, he said.
MarketWatch: And you think that inflation will move higher?
Being cooped up in a house for several days when a marriage is experiencing serious problems — while dealing with the pressure to put on a happy face for the kids and visiting relatives — takes its toll on the most stoic of couples. Holiday time is usually a time when we get a spike in consultations and retentions, says Lois Liberman, a partner at the law firm Blank Rome in New York and chair of the company's matrimonial group. Holiday time is usually fraught with a lot of tension, emotion and financial issues, which is usually the trigger.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other party leaders carefully salted swing districts with young candidates who appealed to minorities, college-educated women and suburbanites who want solutions to problems in their daily lives, not a socialist revolution.
A key reason China's stock turmoil has such a global impact is it is now coinciding with capital outflows and currency weakness.

5. Elimination of basis step-up for inherited assets
Based on the economic outlook, I thought it was prudent to take the first step on the path of gradual normalization of interest rates, Mester said in reference to the Fed's move to raise its short-term target rate from near zero levels last month, to a range between 0.25% and 0.50%. The action had been widely expected, and in remarks ahead of the December Fed gathering, Mester had said the U.S. was ready for a boost in borrowing costs.
Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen during the afternoon said she expects interest rates to rise a few times per year until the end of 2019.

But our study suggests that states should be thinking about not just capping value, but also the number of times physicians interact with the pharmaceutical industry, she said.
But what about more particular policy points? If you look at stock market action Jan. 6, it is clear that investors expect Biden and Congress to do a lot for companies producing clean energy, or developing technology and services to enable other companies to do so.
Mester said she is expecting a pretty weak first couple of months of the year and then improvement as more Americans get the COVID-19 vaccine.
Adding to difficulties is the fact Beijing also has to navigate these challenges while facing accelerating capital outflows. Any central government cleanup of bad debt that revealed a significant deterioration in its fiscal position could heap more pressure on the yuan to weaken.
The closest we can come to Trump among former U.S. presidents might be Calvin Coolidge, an extremely pro-business tax cutter. The chief business of the American people is business, Coolidge famously declared, while his treasury secretary, Andrew Mellon — one of America's wealthiest men — advocated tax cuts for the rich, which would trickle down in benefits to the less fortunate.
That's one conclusion of a report published Wednesday by the Government Accountability Office, the first-ever federal government effort to understand the scope of food insecurity on college campuses and offer possible policy solutions.

Don't rush to file, Kessler says. Think about your end game. Many people file quickly out of anger perhaps after learning of a spouse's misconduct. But it's better to be strategic.

Or, as the title character in the Netflix NFLX, -3.75% television drama Doctor Foster did, bide your time and locate all the financial records first, he adds, so your lawyer won't charge you thousands to subpoena them from your spouse's employer or banks.

If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist. When it comes to Wall Street reform that must be our bottom line. This is true not just from a risk perspective and the fear of another bailout. It is also true from the reality that a handful of huge financial institutions simply have too much economic and political power over this country.
All the same, a short-term pullback could be on the cards, and even more so, if debt ceiling negotiations hit an impasse, as they did in the government shutdown. Appetite for U.S. government paper could suffer if credit ratings agencies see the political brinkmanship as a reason to strip away the U.S.'s gold-plated, triple-A credit rating.

9. Save with purpose, says Malani. Rather than have one big savings account for everything, you should have different accounts for different goals: In 2019, put purpose behind your savings. Start by deciding what you're saving for (i.e. trip to Portugal, new West Elm couch, etc.). Then set up a separate savings account for each thing or experience you're saving for. Finally, nickname the savings account in accordance with its designated purpose. You'll be much less likely to 'borrow' money from your Portugal vacay account than just a general savings account, she explains.

Already three days late to the Airbnb I had paid for in Paris, I decided to give up, for now, on my dream of seeing the City of Light. I called the airline to cancel my flight, and my credit card was immediately refunded the $600 one-way flight — as well as my $350 original flight, essentially erasing my dumb financial mistake of arriving to the airport late, because they were both on the same ticket.
That's because the invasion of the Capitol did nothing to change expectations around the near-term political and economic outlook.

For 2019 the Part D surcharges depend on your 2017 MAGI and they go up using the same MAGI scale as the Part B surcharges. The good news is the 2019 surcharges are slightly lower than for 2018, except for folks in the highest MAGI category. The 2019 monthly surcharge amounts for each covered person can be $12.40, $31.90, $51.40, $70.90, or $77.40. The maximum $77.40 surcharge applies to singles with 2017 MAGI in excess of $500,000 and married individuals who filed 2017 joint returns with MAGI in excess of $750,000.
2. Interest rate rises are likely to be modest, but will still affect bond returns. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds fall. The longer the duration of the bond, the more likely its fall in price. Since fixed income investments are a defensive part of a portfolio, designed in part to offer some stability to the overall value of the portfolio, retirees might consider instituting a ladder of CDs, purchased directly from banks (and keeping within FDIC limits). Most CDs over 1 year in maturity can be redeemed early with a 180-day interest penalty; if interest rates rise significantly, retirees can exercise this put, in essence, when it makes sense to incur the penalty to reap the higher interest rates for the remainder of the original CD term. A short-term bond fund may be added to the fixed income part of the portfolio, to provide some liquidity. Never forget the threat of inflation; while inflation has been low over the past decade, in particular, it could come roaring back at any time; a ladder of inflation-protected securities held in a tax-deferred (401(k) or IRA) account, or a bond fund containing TIPS, might be a prudent part of a person's fixed income portfolio, to help guard against inflation risk.

Some 28 U.S. states have so-called filial responsibility laws, which can be traced back to colonial times and (in theory) impose a duty on adult children to support their impoverished parents. Those states don't include New York. Here's a list of the other 28 that do have those laws, even if they don't practice them. One of those states is Pennsylvania, which did use filial responsibility to force an adult child to pay his mother's bill. In 2012, Pennsylvania court ruled that John Pittas must pay his mother's $93,000 nursing home bill after she moved to Greece. Otherwise, they are rarely enforced.

Under current law, the 12.4% Social Security tax hits the first $137,700 of 2020 wages or net self-employment income. Employees pay 6.2% via withholding from paychecks, and employers pay the remaining 6.2%. Self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4% out of their own pockets via the self-employment (SE) tax. For 2020, the 12.4% Social Security tax cuts out once 2020 wages or net SE income exceed the $137,700 ceiling. For 2021 and beyond, the Social Security tax ceiling will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. As things currently stand, the 2021 ceiling will rise to $142,800.

Rosengren: We've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. We've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. Until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the U.S. is doing, it is what Japan and Europe are doing. So they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.
I think for many years, the builders were focused on that $500,000-and-up market because the margins were healthier, he says.

To avoid moving back to the zero lower bound, Fischer said the government could move to boost the equilibrium real interest rates — the rate consistent with the Fed's goals of low unemployment and 2% inflation. The Fed vice chairman said this rate will remain low for the policy-relevant future.
When it comes to our investments, a similar set-it-and-forget-it mentality has been popular for decades now.

One has to wonder if the yield curve would be as good an indicator this time around because of the Fed's balance-sheet dynamics. At $10 billion in monthly balance-sheet runoffs, the unwinding of the Federal Reserve's $4.4 trillion balance sheet is not a big deal today. The question is: At what run-off rate would that begin to affect the Treasury market more aggressively — $20 billion, $30 billion or $50 billion?

In addition, the conditions the Fed has set for shrinking its balance sheet would be met sooner than they otherwise would have been, Brainard added.
Housing, which has been a reluctant participant throughout this business cycle after overplaying its hand in the previous one, has peaked. Yet even at the high point for single-family housing starts earlier this year, builders were breaking ground on new homes at rates that paled in comparison to those of previous expansions over the last half century.
Complicating this process has been the euro's EURUSD, -0.03% relentless rise, which analysts say may dampen inflation and prove an unwelcome stumbling block for the ECB. Amid the currency's gains, Draghi alluded to how the U.S. may have been trying to devalue its currency to boost American exports. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday touted the benefits of a weak dollar, only for President Donald Trump to later downplay Mnuchin's comments.
Still, Lesser, Gordon and Adams are hopeful the bill of rights will help Connecticut borrowers avoid being devastated by student debt and that it may inspire other states to better regulate the student loan industry.

HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — It used to be that investors outside China could ignore the gyrations in that country's stock market, given that no foreign investors were allowed to buy shares.

Many freelancers are unaware that they're not protected by anti-harassment laws in most states, and New York's new statutes represent a significant gain for those workers, said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality and senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center. If they were harassed by an employee, a customer or a vendor, they had no recourse, and there was no way for them to seek justice for what happened, and now they do, Raghu said. Knowing that you have protections in the law will empower more people to come forward if they've been sexually harassed and to take action.
9. About 90% of investment products have fees and costs which are too high. The academic research in this area, stretching back for decades now, is compelling—higher fees are almost certainly going to lead to lower returns over the long run. Consider a racehorse in the Kentucky Derby. All of the horses racing must carry the same weight—jockey, tack, and (when necessary to equalize things out) some small weights in the saddlebag. If a horse carries more weight (similar, for example, to investments with higher fees), the horse still might manage some smart strategy and win a short race, but for longer races the extra weight is definitely going to slow that horse down. By far the largest single factor affecting investor returns in mutual funds, variable annuities, ETFs and other pooled investment vehicles are the fees and costs incurred. Low-cost products will highly likely possess higher returns over the long run, and just a small difference in returns can add up over a long retirement.
Treasury prices had been drifting lower since the summer, but the trend accelerated after the election as investors bet that the fiscal stimulus promised by Trump would alleviate some of the pressure on the Federal Reserve, allowing them to raise interest rates more swiftly.

Worries originated in China, where the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.51% slid almost 7% on the back of a weak manufacturing reading.

Borrowers whose circumstances have changed since they last filed their tax return — information that won't be reflected in the data retrieval tool — can use other documentation to prove their income, like pay stubs or a letter from their employer. But because those documents typically show net income and not gross income — which is available through tax documents and on which the calculation for income-driven repayment plans are usually based — borrowers' loan payments could wind up being higher, Kantrowitz said.

With annualized CPI in December at 1.4% there is still clearly some way to go before monetary policy can start to normalize, even though core CPI […] is up 1.1%, Jacob Deppe, head of trading at online platform Infinox, said of the eurozone inflation data. Not even the ECB expects inflation to return to target this year, but if signs are that it is on course to do so […] the end of quantitative easing in September looks likely.
China's enormous current-account surplus increased in 2015 as falling commodity prices cheapened the total value of the raw materials imported by Chinese manufacturers.
The ECB, led by President Mario Draghi, in December confirmed its plan to halve its quantitative easing program to €30 billion starting this month, and to let it run until the end of September 2018 or beyond. The central bank meets next on Jan. 25.
Colombo calls this setup a continuation pattern where the same formation occurs — in this case, a descending triangle — and a break would see similar declines to the prior move. We could see another couple of thousand on the downside should we break, Colombo said in a follow-up call with MarketWatch.
We built this five-position portfolio using the five ETFs with the strongest positive price momentum from a universe of 124 sector, style-box, single-country and regional ETFs.
[Donald Trump] has taken a very, very unpresidential step [of] talking down the currency, said Weston. The market has taken it to heart.
Much more spending will be necessary just to pull the economy back to the levels of employment and unemployment that we had before the COVID recession, and to help the millions who have been hurt by the pandemic. We still don't even know how much worse the pandemic itself will get before the effects of vaccination can seriously reduce infection rates.
The song, which features lyrics such as, Moved back home, heavy as a stone / Boxes filled with clothes and piles of student loans, is the latest example of student debt and the obstacles 20-somethings face landing a decent job entering pop culture.
Investors already on Tuesday got a taste of how BOJ tightening can rattle the markets. The central bank said it would buy less of its long-dated bonds, sparking speculation Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda could back away from its ultraloose monetary policy as early as this year.
Watch the Federal Reserve and trade talks, of course, but also the junk-bond market.
China already has 10% daily limits up or down on individual stocks, which are regularly reached. Any circuit breakers should have taken into account the volatility in a market when some 90% of investors are retail and the market prohibits intraday trading.
There is an elephant in the room, the KPMG/PCAOB scandal, that is repeatedly ignored in public forums. I asked Chairman Clayton and Chairman Duhnke at the December AICPA conference about whether the PCAOB would report soon on any remedial actions taken in the wake of the scandal. Clayton said he can't speak about it because of the ongoing investigation and legal action and Duhnke looked like he didn't know what I was talking about.

The unemployment rate in Spain, for example, is still almost 20%, while around 12% of people are without a job in Italy. Some political analysts fear there will be snap elections in Italy this year after Matteo Renzi resigned in December after losing a referendum on constitutional reforms. Other major political events this year in Europe include elections in France and Germany, as well as Brexit negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union.
At the first policy-setting meeting this year, the central bank left its key refinancing rate at 0% and the deposit rate at negative 0.4%, as was widely expected. Policy makers also made no changes to the ECB's 80-billion-euro-a-month bond-buying program.
Tools of Chinese mercantilism—forced technology transfer and patent theft, export subsidies and markets closed to U.S. exports outside of agriculture and in some measure banking—remain largely in place. Biden can hardly expect to combat those by simply embracing multilateralism in the World Trade Organization with European cooperation.
If appraisals come in lower than expected, it can jeopardize a sale if the buyer in question cannot make up the difference between the mortgage offered and the proposed sale price. But too high of an appraisal represents a risk, too: If home prices fall, it creates an even larger burden for the homeowner and mortgage lender alike, especially if the homeowner falls behind on their payments.
The strategist forecast the S&P 500 to trade in a range of 2,375 to 2,700 for 2019.
That's more than three times as many as those living in Washington state — even though winnings in that corner of the Pacific Northwest aren't subject to state income tax.

Still, there are a number of risks reappearing, like ongoing U.S.-China trade talks and the government shutdown, foreshadowing how well the government will be able to tackle important issues like the debt ceiling and the budget, he said, adding that investors may be applying a 'discord discount' to equity valuations as they hedge against the threat of gridlock leading to lasting economic damage.

For now, worries about tariffs, [U.S.-]China talks, Brexit, politics and [the U.S.] government shutdown are enough to add to gold, said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management, in a daily note.
Adding to difficulties is the fact Beijing also has to navigate these challenges while facing accelerating capital outflows. Any central government cleanup of bad debt that revealed a significant deterioration in its fiscal position could heap more pressure on the yuan to weaken.
But here's another critical point that gets lost in the social-media scrum: Just because you're in a 24% tax bracket doesn't mean your entire income is taxed at 24%. Under current tax law, if you were a single person, you would only pay that 24% rate in 2019 on income between $84,201 and $168,400.
Another issue is that in China the overlap between corporates and the state can often make it difficult to get a true financial picture. For instance, hugely profitable state banks in recent years have by some estimates accounted for 50% of the net profits of all listed Chinese companies. This could mean if China's banks had to recognize a substantial increase in bad debts, another wild card is the impact on the central government's fiscal position through lost tax revenue.
Mortgage data provider Ellie Mae shows that the relaxation of credit standards indeed has been gradual. Average credit scores for home purchases slipped a bit in October (the latest data available) compared with 12 months earlier. Debt-to-income ratios, which measure borrowers' debt loads, nudged upward over the same period. That means they have higher debt and less flexibility to withstand financial emergencies.
In ETF trading, the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, -0.58% fell 0.6%, the iShares Silver Trust SLV, -1.31% shed 0.1% and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, -1.72% lost 0.7%.

(This story was updated on Aug. 26, 2019.)
That means Saudi Arabia will carry a greater burden of the oil-output cuts in the next two months, as Russia and Kazakhstan are allowed to boost production by a combined 75,000 barrels a day.
Minutes of the Dec. 13-14 meeting show the central bankers thought they might have to be more aggressive in raising interest rates than the gradual pace that they have been signaling.

But today's 53 million millennial workers face challenges when it comes to saving and investing for their retirement. This generation is disproportionally burdened by money-related stress, with 24% reporting that student loan debt is the source of this stress, according to a recent survey by Charles Schwab. And 72% of millennial workers surveyed by Transamerica agree that they do not know as much as they should about retirement investing and, among those participating in a retirement plan, a quarter admit to being unsure of how their savings are invested.

Next up on the prepayment menu are state and local income and property taxes that are due early next year. Prepaying those bills before year-end can decrease your 2020 federal income tax bill, because your itemized deductions total will be that much higher. However, the TCJA decreased the maximum amount you can deduct for state and local taxes to $10,000 or $5,000 if you use married filing separate status. So, beware of that limitation.
Warning: The state and local tax prepayment drill can be a bad idea if you will owe the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for this year. That's because write-offs for state and local income and property taxes are completely disallowed under the AMT rules. Therefore, prepaying those expenses may do little or no tax-saving good if you will be in the AMT zone. Thankfully, changes included in the TCJA took millions of taxpayers out of AMT danger, but not everybody. Ask your tax adviser if you're in the clear for this year or not.

There are three sources of people who can refuse to raise the debt limit — the president, the Senate and the House — and now one of them has been removed, Veuger told MarketWatch. What's more, the debt ceiling has been a big issue for the House, but it hasn't been a huge deal in the Senate over the past few years, he added. Even so, it is possible that the Senate or president could refuse to lift the debt limit, Veuger said.

A top near inauguration day would be a textbook illustration of the old investment adage: buy the rumor, sell the fact. The saying reflects the notion that by the time an anticipated event occurs, investors have already factored it into prices.
Yields have been in a steady uptrend over the past six months, ever since the 10-year touched an all-time low around 1.36% in July, though the move accelerated after the November election of Trump, whose policies, include ramping up fiscal spending, are expected to stoke inflation. Rising inflation erodes the value of a bond's fixed payments. Typically, when inflation is on the rise, bond investors demand higher yields to compensate for the corrosive effect that higher prices have on real returns.

According to the latest BofA Merrill Lynch fund manager survey, the average cash position in portfolios fell to a five-year low of 4.4%. Equity allocation hit a two-year high of 55%. Such positioning has been echoed across Wall Street: TD Ameritrade recently reported that its clients ended 2017 with market exposure at all-time highs, while cash balances for Charles Schwab clients reached their lowest level on record in the third quarter, according to Morgan Stanley, which wrote that retail investors can't stay away from stocks.

Rosengren: We've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. We've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. Until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the U.S. is doing, it is what Japan and Europe are doing. So they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.
However, some of the most prominent financial names reporting quarterly results Wednesday ended lower, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.88% finishing off 0.6 % after the investment bank reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings. Citigroup Inc.

About two-thirds of the participants had coverage through their employer or someone else's work. Another 20% had coverage through a form of government-provided insurance and 8% bought their own health insurance, the poll said.
An examination of volatility, however, paints a much different picture. We found volatility in returns to the S&P 500 to be lower in restrictive monetary policy periods than in expansive monetary periods, as annualized volatility was 16.3% during expansive periods and only 14.4% during restrictive periods. Our research also shows that downside risk in equities was similar during expansive and restrictive periods. Specifically, investors had about a one-in-10 chance of experiencing a one-month loss of 4.5% or more in both expansive and restrictive conditions.

Under current law, the federal income tax basis of an inherited capital-gain asset is stepped up fair market value as of the decedent's date of death. So, if heirs sell inherited capital-gain assets, they only owe federal capital gains tax on the post-death appreciation, if any. This provision can be a huge tax-saver for greatly-appreciated inherited assets — such as personal residences that were acquired many years ago for next to nothing and are now worth millions. The Biden plan would eliminate this tax-saving provision.
 A provision in the 1994 crime bill banned prisoners from accessing Pell grants. If lawmakers were to lift that ban, 463,000 prisoners could become eligible. 
Employers of all sizes won't be allowed to ask job applicants about their salary history in California, and starting on July 1, 2018 in San Francisco, employers won't be allowed to give out salary information about current or former employees without written permission.

With control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have more scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.
We cannot educate people out of this crisis. Given the reality on the ground, the most sophisticated among us would be hard-pressed to master the complex machinery of personal finance. Yet instead of focusing on reforms to fix our train wreck of a retirement system, our policy makers are distracted by campaigns for partial stopgap measures. As lawmakers grapple with payday loans and usurious credit card interest rates, retirement security goes by the boards. The World Economic Forum (WEF) estimates that the United States had a $28 trillion retirement savings gap in 2015—the largest in the world. By 2050, they project this will grow to $137 trillion. This is almost a $3 trillion annual increase—five times the annual U.S. defense budget.

The technology sector, when it's not crashing 2000-style, tends to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average over time as its member companies grow faster; so the present renewed leadership of the Nasdaq 100 is a positive sign for the stock market, and I would certainly be looking for the broader market (as represented by the S&P 500) to make new highs too.
The 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% was up 1.5 basis point to 2.073%, marking the 14th straight day of yield gains. The 30-year bond rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% was up 1.4 basis point to 2.927%, the highest in close to three months.
Medicare Parts A and B do not pay for all health care expenses. Coverage gaps include copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. So you may want to buy a so-called Medigap policy, which is private supplemental insurance that's intended to cover some or all of the gaps. In most states, insurance companies can only sell standardized Medigap policies that offer the same basic benefits. Some Medigap policies offer additional benefits for an additional cost. Premiums vary depending on the plan you select.
Nalani and Sarina, who grew up in New Jersey and have performed for Bruce Springsteen, heard stories of their friends' challenges, including struggling to get a job without experience and moving from city to city chasing unpaid internships until they couldn't afford to anymore.

Servicers also aren't providing borrowers with enough information about their best options for repayment, consumer advocates say. Federal student loan borrowers have a variety of protections and payment plans to choose from, which should make it nearly impossible for a borrower to default. And yet, one in four student loan borrowers is in default or struggling to repay their loan, according to the CFPB. Servicers may be in part to blame — as borrowers' main point of contact during the repayment process they're not doing enough to help borrowers find the repayment plans that are right for them, advocates say.

If the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next.

The U.S. central bank should be able to avoid drama like the infamous taper tantrum of 2013, said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, on Friday. We've learned the lessons of the past and are being thoughtful and watchful as the year unfolds, Harker said. While it should be a year of developments, it should also be a boring one, he said. Harker said the Fed has never before faced a need to shrink its balance sheet from $4.5 trillion, but said the process should remain slow and mechanical.

It is true that adjustments in the overnight rate, up or down, generally drive long-term interest rates in the same direction. But not always. Long-term rates have other priorities to consider, including the path of the overnight rate going forward, inflation expectations, and the perceived risk of holding a 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% versus rolling over a short-term T-bill TMUBMUSD03M, 0.012% .

It is, at this point, almost surely too widespread to be contained in any specific state or region of our country, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, dean and professor of health services, policy and practice at the Brown University School of Public Health, in a statement.

Investor optimism was further reinforced by comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who said during a Friday morning appearance that the jobs report didn't materially increase concerns over rising inflation, while reiterating that the central bank would continue to keep an open mind about how much it will raise interest rates in 2019 and how aggressively it will shrink its balance sheet, based on incoming data about the U.S. and global economy, including recent weakness in equity markets.
I think I have been really focused on conduct and accountability, trying to make sure the consequences of certain actions are clear and fair, making sure we are using all the tools we have in our toolbox effectively. I am talking, of course, about automatic disqualifications.

If you are earning $85,000 a year, and want to take a 2-year career break, most women assume the cost of such a break is $170,000, Krawcheck said. The right answer is it's more than a $1 million.…When you calculate the true cost of a career break, you might just want to get a babysitter. The worst decision you make is to make a decision with poor information.

People may have reason to care less about the recent stock-market volatility, but perhaps for all the wrong reasons. Just over half of Americans own stocks, a Gallup report recently concluded. That includes 401(k) plans, shares in an equity mutual fund and/or an IRA account. Worse, two-thirds of Americans do not even participate in or have access to a 401(k) plan, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In other words, they simply don't have a vested interest.

Emerging markets have profited from two major trends sweeping across the world. Global growth has perked up, with the Markit global composite purchasing manufacturer's index hitting a 3-year high of around 54.3 last week.

Slowiaczek is cautious about taking on clients who refer to him as a pit bull or a shark. Sometimes, people might say that because we're tough, he says, but if you go in with all guns blazing and start in a mean, aggressive manner, you automatically create a very adversarial situation. That could increase the cost of the divorce — which could vary between $25,000 to $100,000, depending on the assets involved, the lawyer's fees and where you live — by double or even triple, he says. Be courteous and respectful. The key is to avoid escalation.

TWTR, -1.47% and TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, -3.66% — saw revenue soar 25.8% and earnings surge 42% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Wall Street still expects massive sales growth to continue in fourth-quarter results this year, with revenue expected to increase 46.4%, but earnings are only expected to grow 8.5%, dragged down by Facebook's hefty spending on combating issues of data privacy, security and breaches.
The Internal Revenue Service hasn't released a detailed policy on how to go about paying taxes using cryptocurrency, besides a ruling in 2014 stating that selling bitcoin is treated the same as selling property or any other capital asset.

By his group's estimations, removing the tip credit would require restaurants to increase hourly wages of servers by 220% as long as they still received the standard tip rate of 20% from most customers — an unsustainable amount of pay for restaurants.

An Axios report earlier Saturday detailing the $5.7 billion steel barrier funding proposal and the temporary immigrant protection extensions, also said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly told Trump that Pelosi is unlikely to concede to end the partial shutdown without White House action, especially in the wake of her letter telling the president not to deliver the State of the Union address.

The solution to poor student- and labor-market outcomes is straightforward: Provide transparency around expected higher-education outcomes. Especially in the context of professional and skills-based programs, what might one expect in terms of increases in future income? What percentage of graduates attain employment?

Dollar traders are also cautiously looking at Tuesday evening's presidential State of the Union address, as well as the conclusion Wednesday of a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting. No changes are expected from the Fed during the meeting, the last to be headed by Janet Yellen. She will be succeeded by Fed Gov. Jay Powell.
Many freelancers are unaware that they're not protected by anti-harassment laws in most states, and New York's new statutes represent a significant gain for those workers, said Maya Raghu, director of workplace equality and senior counsel at the National Women's Law Center. If they were harassed by an employee, a customer or a vendor, they had no recourse, and there was no way for them to seek justice for what happened, and now they do, Raghu said. Knowing that you have protections in the law will empower more people to come forward if they've been sexually harassed and to take action.
Bloomberg notes that Bezos, who had been the world's richest person since 2017, would still hold a sizable lead over Musk if it weren't for his divorce from MacKenzie Scott in 2019, which gave his ex-wife 25% of his Amazon stake.

Rosengren: That's accurate. Financial conditions have not tightened significantly with the increase in short-term interest rates. Part of that is the stock market has gone up quite a bit and exchange rates and some of these other variables are being affected by a stimulative fiscal policy. So even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. And now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% is a little less than 2.5% right now. I would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.

Do what you would do without regard to potential tax changes, he said. If you need to sell an asset today, sell it. If you want to ride things out, ride things out. Don't let potential tax issues control your financial plans.
Trump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president. Tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices. Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).
And so my message to you today is straightforward: If elected president, I will rein in Wall Street so they can't crash our economy again.

At the same time, bond prices are expected to extend their downtrend, pushing yields which move inversely higher, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.

There are four federal funds rate increases expected by the market in 2018, for about 100 basis points in tightening by the Federal Reserve. If the federal funds rate were to rise by 100 basis points from 1.5% at present to 2.5%, then the two-year Treasury note yield would be at 3% or higher, as historically the correlation between the two has been very close. That means that if the 10-year Treasury yield stays below 3% — and that is the $4.4 trillion question — then the yield curve would likely invert in 2018.

The student loan bill of rights is a valiant effort at helping Connecticut borrowers better manage their debt, said Joshua Cohen, a Connecticut lawyer specializing in student loan issues. But he's concerned they won't be as effective as legislators hope. He's confident the ombudsman and the licensing requirements will be effective at regulating servicers of private student loans, but he's worried that the companies who service federal student loans will argue they won't have to abide by the Connecticut statute because federal law pre-empts it. Cohen said he's not sure that argument would hold up (the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed in the wake of the financial crisis made it more difficult for federal government laws to pre-empt state laws regarding consumer protection), but he said it's still a concern.

It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.

Left unaddressed, poverty among the elderly could drive up federal income tax rates by 10 percentage points. The expenses of poor or near-poor older Americans will inevitably be passed on to other citizens, from higher Medicaid entitlements (for nursing homes and assisted living costs) to the taxpayer burden from a spike in homelessness.
Changes proposed by the Department of Labor on Dec. 5 would allow employers to legally pocket tips that servers earn at restaurants. The change, which would repeal part of a 2011 ruling that said employers could not pocket their workers' tips, is meant to level a growing disparity between what tipped employees like servers earn compared with back-of-house employees like cooks. After the changes, employers could take all tips earned by servers and redistribute them to workers that are not tipped.

As many as 500 were cut, and most workers were notified on Thursday. As we've previously stated, we've been looking at our structure for some time as we explore ways to operate more effectively, the company said in a statement. The company will promote more than 360 associates into positions with higher responsibility, a Wal-Mart spokesperson said. These positions will be in focus areas for the company, like its expansion in online grocery. Workers that were laid off will be paid for up to 60 days as they search for a new job, and Wal-Mart will provide outplacement services, resume skills training, and other counseling through its employee assistance program.

Eligible workers will also receive a fiscal year-end incentive. Wal-Mart shares are up nearly 61% for the past year while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 31.3% for the period.

Shares of Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% shed 0.5% in morning trade Wednesday, after UBS did an about-face on the banking giant, flipping to bearish from bullish, amid concerns over how new protectionist policies may affect Citigroup's global franchise. Analyst Saul Martinez gave the stock a rare sell rating, after it was at buy for nearly three years. He cut the stock price target to $58, which is 3.2% below current levels, from $64. Only 15% of companies covered by Citigroup have sell ratings. Citigroup's global franchise is generally a good thing, but it also leaves the company less levered to lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates in the U.S., and more exposed to risks associated with the President-elect's protectionist policy stances, Martinez wrote in a note to clients. He said an underperforming Mexican franchise and Asia consumer businesses in slower growth markets also dampen his view.

The student loan bill of rights is a valiant effort at helping Connecticut borrowers better manage their debt, said Joshua Cohen, a Connecticut lawyer specializing in student loan issues. But he's concerned they won't be as effective as legislators hope. He's confident the ombudsman and the licensing requirements will be effective at regulating servicers of private student loans, but he's worried that the companies who service federal student loans will argue they won't have to abide by the Connecticut statute because federal law pre-empts it. Cohen said he's not sure that argument would hold up (the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation passed in the wake of the financial crisis made it more difficult for federal government laws to pre-empt state laws regarding consumer protection), but he said it's still a concern.

Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.

MarketWatch: Do you think the Fed should raise rates at a faster pace than gradual?
Mortgage lenders learned an enduring lesson in the housing crisis a decade ago: Make sure borrowers can repay their loans. So lenders tightened mortgage standards, partly on their own and partly in response to a regulatory crackdown on risky mortgages. These changes made it harder to get a home loan.

When reducing the number of brackets, you don't want to have too much of a tax cut, but you also want to try to approximate something like the original curve, Cole said. The result of that means sometimes if you're not super generous all the way across, you're going to end up with a tax increase for some. It's a little causality of simplification.

There is no government certification or central information resource informing consumers whether a specific brand of toy is hackable. However, a simple Google search could alert you to past hacks or other problems in the company. Aside from doing the obvious online search, buyers should also read the full privacy policies from the company and ensure the company will notify them in the case of a hack or data breach. Ensure the company notifies users when privacy policies change. Pay particular attention to where it stores user data and what security measures it takes to protect it, like whether the data is encrypted, and if it shares with (or even sells) data to third parties.
There are 4.6 million women who work in occupations with poverty-level wages, nearly three times as many as the 1.5 million men who do, the organization said in a statement on Equal Pay Day, a date to highlight the gender wage gap around the country. In addition, the analysis finds racial disparities compounding gender inequality in the labor market. Black and Hispanic women are more than twice as likely to work in service occupations as white women.
A complex constellation of risk factors, only a few of which are directly tied to COVID-19, are known to drive these tragic deaths, they wrote.

To switch from a tax-deferred retirement savings accounts to a potentially tax-free Roth IRA savings account. Waiting to do so will only require that you pay higher income taxes in the future on hopefully additional savings (you can't believe federal income tax rates will fall); they will most likely rise, and you can manage the state income tax bill on your tax-deferred savings by relocating, if appropriate, as soon as possible, then converting. If that involves a change of employer, you have an ideal opportunity to convert all of your 401(k) and/or 403b balances to Roth accounts at the time.

It seems to me that we should proceed with caution and be patient as we approach our destination, George said.
Higher inflation expectations had driven the U.S. dollar index DXY, +0.41% to 14-year highs before its recent stall, although that impact can be slow to filter into the everyday economy. And, what's been called a reflation trade had created an exodus out of bonds and into stocks to a degree that some observers say finally threatens the bond market's multidecade bull run.
The ECB made no changes to its interest rates, keeping the deposit rate at a negative 0.4% and the refinancing rate at 0%.

To be sure, I'm focusing on the economy as a whole, which doesn't mean that every individual's retirement prospects are brightening. In fact, as has been often noted in recent years, many have not saved and invested enough. A stronger long-term uptrend in the stock market is unable to bail out a retiree in that position.

Such squeezes tend to precede moves higher in the broader market. (A volatility squeeze occurs when the volatility of a stock falls below recent levels.) Indeed, the market delivered an explosive rally shortly after the volatility squeeze in September. But as markets often do, it tested our nerves by falling sharply at first, tagging its upward sloping 200-day moving average. The big push came after Donald Trump was elected president.
The Green New Deal is premised on three observations: First, there are unutilized and underutilized resources — especially human talent — that can be used effectively. Second, if there were more demand for those with low and medium skills, their wages and standards of living would rise. Third, a good environment is an essential part of human wellbeing, today and in the future.

Arguing for more in compensation can also be something of a fool's errand. Walker said his law firm doesn't even take on cases involving these outbreaks. Don't call us if you get sick on a cruise, he said. Establishing where the virus came from, or that the cruise line was negligent, is virtually impossible to prove.

I think President Trump is going to downsize government, cut out many of our 'free lunch' programs and provide growth through the decrease in corporate and personal taxes and the closing of many tax loopholes, said Mark Grant, chief strategist at Hilltop Securities, in a Monday note.  I also believe that we will be exporting oil and natural gas in short order and that those revenues will help close the funding gap as new infrastructure projects are initiated.

As a higher education policy expert, Harnisch said he also sees why some view the rankings as superficial or even counterproductive. But he's particularly concerned about the finances of public colleges in states like Wisconsin, where state lawmakers have pulled back on funding their higher education institutions. Anything schools can do to convince people to make up that shortfall is useful, he said.
It's hard to get hurt too badly when you're getting paid 12%-14% to wait for a bottom.
Furthermore, investors seem to be ignoring the risk associated with Trump's interest in negotiating better trade deals. The only way he can do this is to threaten a trade war with China and within NAFTA. If he does that, he needs those countries to believe that he is capable, and willing, to initiate a trade war for them to come to the table and renegotiate existing deals, or to make concessions. And that's the only way he will come out of those negotiations a winner.
That's because as it stands Americans have been maintaining disposable income levels that are 15% higher than it normally would be relative to the scale of the economy, Summers said during a presentation Monday at the Allied Social Science Associations' annual meeting.

A measure of volatility on Wall Street on Monday rose to its highest level in more than 5 months as U.S. equity benchmarks dipped and as the yield in a benchmark Treasury note climbed to its highest level in more than three years. The CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% was up about 18% at 13.03, marking its highest level since Aug. 18, 2017, according to FactSet data. The VIX uses bullish and bearish option bets on the S&P 500 index to reflect expected volatility over the coming 30 days, and it typically rises as stocks fall. However, the gauge, sometimes referred to as the fear index, has been abnormally low, trading below its historical average at around 20. To be sure, it is still holding at a level below that historic mean but its recent pick up suggests that investors are betting that volatility will accelerate over the coming days and months. A rise in 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% above 2.71% also has drawn attention, because rising rates can undercut appetite for stocks if government paper offer richer yields than risk assets like stocks. Rising yields, President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's updated policy statement on Wednesday and a bevy of earnings set to be released throughout the week could induce choppy trade in an otherwise subdued market.
For the week, the Dow rose 2.3%, the S&P 500 gained 2.6%, while the Nasdaq is up 3.4%.

Stocks move based on an improving profit outlook, which the last time I checked was still improving. It is well-known that the bond market is often early and moves before the stock market does. I have seen the stock market make an all-time high at a time when the Treasury yield curve was inverted and certain mortgage bonds were crashing in October 2007. The yield curve is not yet inverted, nor do we have similar stress in mortgage bonds or junk bonds for that matter, so the yield curve could shrink further and the stock market could still rise.

If, instead, the Fed persists is raising the funds rate to the point that it exceeds the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a recession would be the likely outcome.

And I would put financial conditions – that is not a goal of monetary policy – but it makes it harder to start tightening if you have to do a lot of tightening, and if you really have to slow down the economy. If you think that potential GDP is growing around 1.75%, well if you want to get the unemployment rate to gradually go up, you are going to have to be seeing some 1.5% [GDP prints] and some lower numbers than we've been seeing. When we see those numbers it is possible that you get more of a slowdown than you're anticipating, and that can be particularly true, I think, if financial markets are a little bit too ebullient. So I think financial conditions and financial stability issues complement some of the concerns I would have about whether we're getting to an unsustainable level of unemployment rate over time.
The volume of global trade has slowed dramatically after a 13% post-recession bounce in 2010. Both revenue and operating earnings for S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% companies are expected to decline in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to Bianco Research.

Indeed, the core structural problem is that the federal government writes blank checks for education programs regardless of whether the field of study is demanded or will yield a future income capable of allowing the student to repay his or her debt. In effect, the government does not conduct an ability to repay test. Even without new debt relief efforts, a recent study determined that under current policy the U.S. government (and accordingly the American taxpayer) should already expect to lose more than $400 billion in unpaid existing student loans.

Like last year, though, we doubt that this latest bout of renminbi strength will continue for much longer. After all, the recent rally in the dollar means that the renminbi has appreciated in trade-weighted terms. And with the euro EURUSD, -0.03% and yen USDJPY, +0.03% likely to weaken against the dollar during the course of this year on account of diverging monetary policies in Europe and Japan relative to that in the US, the renminbi would need to weaken against the dollar just to simply tread water in trade-weighted terms. Indeed, given that we forecast the euro to weaken to $0.95/€ and the yen to head towards ¥130/$, the renminbi would need to depreciate to around 7.3/$, from 6.89/$ currently, in order to hold its ground in trade-weighted terms (see chart below).

But it is not just Trump's proposed tax changes that plausibly affect market psychology. The U.S. has never had a president like him. Not only is he an actor, like Ronald Reagan; he is also a motivational writer and speaker, a brand name in real estate, and a tough deal maker. If he ever reveals his financial information, or if his family is able to use his influence as president to improve its bottom line, he might even prove to be successful in business.

Mortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes. The demographic and time patterns of the non-COVID excess deaths (NCEDs) point to deaths of despair rather than an under-count of COVID deaths. They increased steadily from March to June and then plateaued.
Ten-year Treasury yields declined by almost 70 basis points in the last two months: from 3.24% in early November to 2.55% last week amid the stock market rout before inching their way back to 2.72% in the wake of Friday's solid jobs report. In that same period, the Fed has raised the funds rate by a mere 25 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%.

A trade war with China remains a distinct possibility. The terms of the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, or Brexit, have yet to be determined. France is dealing with anti-government street protests, triggered by an announced fuel tax, since abandoned, and a push for a higher minimum wage. Italy and the European Union, which were at loggerheads over Italy's budget, have come to some kind of an agreement that will allow Europe's fourth-largest economy to avoid sanctions for now.
The healthy report comes on the heels of a statement from China's Commerce Ministry confirming that a delegation of U.S. trade officials would meet with their Chinese counterparts Monday and Tuesday, news reports said, marking the first time the two sides have met since President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day trade truce last month.

So how likely or imminent is a U.S. recession? Not very. It's possible that an out-of-nowhere shock could tip a slow-growing economy into negative territory. But real recession, not just an arithmetic decline in real gross domestic product, such as the ones that occurred in the first quarter of 2011 and 2015, requires some heavy lifting.

The BOJ has for years been among the most accommodative central banks in the world and as recent as December reaffirmed its commitment to aggressive qualitative and quantitative-easing program, also known as QQE. With inflation stubbornly running below the BOJ's 2% annual target, the central bank has since early 2016 kept interest rates in negative territory and even introduced a 0%-target for its 10-year government bond yields to avoid deflation.

In his divorce decree it states that he shall maintain a $300,000 life insurance for his children as beneficiary until they reach the age of 23. However, on the actual policy he only has me listed as beneficiary. There is nothing indicating that this is left for his children should he pass prior to them reaching age 23. What would the legal liability be on this if he should pass before me?

The American people are catching on. They understand that something is profoundly wrong when, in our country today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent and when the 20 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 150 million Americans – half of our population. They know that the system is rigged when the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, while 58 percent of all new income goes to the top 1 percent.

In a nationwide report released Thursday, Generation Progress, the youth-focused arm of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, noted that Connecticut is the first state to pass a student loan bill of rights with an ombudsman, the servicer licensing requirement and other consumer protections for borrowers. The report highlighted Connecticut's efforts as one of the ways states can take action on the student debt crisis without waiting for the federal government. Other states are attacking the student loan crisis in different ways, the report noted, including, working to help borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates, holding for-profit colleges accountable and reversing laws that penalized student loan borrowers behind on their payments by taking away their driver's or professional license.

Perhaps surprisingly given the president's GOP base, Republican concerns around immigration remained steady over that period at 34%.

The median U.S. household currently holds just $11,700 in savings, according to an analysis released last August of Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data by personal-finance site Magnify Money. The bottom 20% by income have no savings and the second lowest 20% income earners have $26,450 saved. (Median balances, the midpoint value, are lower than the average savings rates.)

(Most financial statements arrive between the 3rd and 8th of the month, he says, as they're usually mailed at the end of every month.) Accountant records are also a fertile ground for information on a spouse's financial affairs, he adds, and can also be subpoenaed.

A financial crisis accompanying a recession introduces a new prototype and limits the effectiveness of the traditional cure. Once a boom goes bust, monetary and fiscal policy become less effective because of necessary deleveraging, even though ultra-low interest rates are an incentive to borrow and spend.

That's a problem because the gig economy matters. All that missing data could help economists understand the state of our economy and the changing nature of the workforce, and — in a climate of stagnant wage growth — shed more light on how much money people earn.

Still, Colas says earnings guidance will prove crucial, as it may offer companies the opportunity to beat back downcast expectations in the aftermath of the sharp selloff last Thursday, sparked by Apple Inc.'s AAPL, +1.27% cut to its sales forecasts, which was blamed on Washington's dust-up with Beijing.
If selling some losers would cause your 2020 capital losses to exceed your 2020 capital gains, the result would be a net capital loss for the year. No problem. That net capital loss can be used to shelter up to $3,000 of 2020 income from salaries, bonuses, self-employment income, interest income, royalties, and whatever else ($1,500 if you use married filing separate status). Any excess net capital loss is carried forward to next year and beyond.
Under current law, another credit of up to $2,100 is allowed to cover expenses to care for a qualifying dependent, including an eligible child, or up to $4,200 for expenses to care for two or more qualifying dependents. In most cases, however, an income limitation reduces the maximum allowable credit to $1,200 or $2,400 for two or more qualifying dependents.
1) Chinese policy makers have enacted a shift in recent days. Over the first four trading days of the year, Beijing allowed the yuan to weaken 0.8%, which is the largest slide over such a period since August, according to Goldman.

In the wake of Donald Trump's election, many are looking to the stock market to learn what is in store for the economy. While much of the short-run action likely reflects movements in market confidence or uncertainty, upcoming decisions on corporate taxes or labor policy may influence what shareholders ultimately receive. Our research implies that expectations regarding redistribution, rather than forecasts of overall economic performance, may play a crucial role in driving stock prices as the political agenda is revealed.

Bernanke said the Fed was also successful in restoring markets in the wake of the short, sharp financial crisis in early March when the economic impact of the coming pandemic became understood.
Yields, which move inversely to debt prices, initially crept higher after the Fed released its policy statement, then pulled back. The two-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , the most sensitive to changes to monetary policy, rose just 0.18 basis points to 2.142%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% was little budged on the day at 2.722%, after earlier testing levels last seen in April 2014.

Stocks fell hard Thursday after Apple cut its revenue guidance, in part citing weakness in China. A round of weak manufacturing survey data out of China, the eurozone and the U.S. added to the gloom. Apple shares fell sharply, posting their biggest one-day percentage drop since 2013 while the overall market drop left the S&P 500 and the Dow with the worst start to a year since 2000.
The Fed penciled in three rate increases in 2018, but market participants are beginning to take this number with a grain of salt. Earlier in the session, Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker shared his expectation of only two interest rate increases in 2018.

With the economy already close to full employment and 2% inflation, focusing fiscal policy on boosting short-term demand will more likely result in inflationary pressures, and is relatively more likely to be accompanied by increases in interest rates, Brainard said in a speech to the Brookings Institution.
The Department of Education remains fully funded, which means its contractors are still collecting student loan payments and the agency is still dispersing grants and federal student loans.

Peter Morici:Britain should quit Europe and unilaterally declare free trade
If the Fed sticks to its projected rate increases in the face of stable or declining long-term rates, the recession forecast becomes a real possibility. As I explained in my Dec. 23 MarketWatch column, a failure of long rates to cooperate could upend the Fed's best-laid plans. The yield curve could invert this time at exceptionally low levels. And an inverted yield curve, with the benchmark rate higher than the long rate, has been a reliable harbinger of recession.

Net-worth poverty rates among Black households with children rose from 46% in 2001 to 51% in 2007 and kept inching upward until 2013, after which they decreased slightly. In white households they increased from 24% to 30% during the Great Recession, but have decreased since then, the authors wrote. The increase in net-worth poverty for Black households, when combined with the null increase for white households, has widened the racial gap over time, they wrote.
Borrowers whose circumstances have changed since they last filed their tax return — information that won't be reflected in the data retrieval tool — can use other documentation to prove their income, like pay stubs or a letter from their employer. But because those documents typically show net income and not gross income — which is available through tax documents and on which the calculation for income-driven repayment plans are usually based — borrowers' loan payments could wind up being higher, Kantrowitz said.
The report suggests a national response that goes beyond what individual campuses can do.

That sounds like important news for Trump. In fact, the Dow had already hit nine record highs before the election, when Hillary Clinton was projected to win.

The Dallas Fed surveyed oil and gas companies in its region on a variety of topics, including where they expect oil prices to be at the end of the year (between $45 and $55) and their capital expenditure plans. One table that stood out is the lack of environmental efforts despite the investor pressure in this area. Even of the largest companies — that produce at least 10,000 barrels a day — only half have a plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
But they should be, he says, because a cut in the state's higher education budget can have a direct impact on a family's budget. Between 2008 and 2014—the same time states were walking back their investment in public colleges and universities -- tuition and fees at two-year and four-year public universities rose 28% on average. The skyrocketing student debt we see is a symptom of a disease and the disease we see is state disinvestment from higher education, said Allison, Young Invincibles' deputy director of policy and research.

Stocks move based on an improving profit outlook, which the last time I checked was still improving. It is well-known that the bond market is often early and moves before the stock market does. I have seen the stock market make an all-time high at a time when the Treasury yield curve was inverted and certain mortgage bonds were crashing in October 2007. The yield curve is not yet inverted, nor do we have similar stress in mortgage bonds or junk bonds for that matter, so the yield curve could shrink further and the stock market could still rise.
Gender pay gap figures don't adjust for job choice and duration, which all influence pay. Women dominate fields like education, which are not typically high-paying. Men dominate fields like IT, math, engineering and sciences, which tend to have higher-paying jobs. But as more women have achieved a college education and entered the workforce over the last half-century, the gender wage gap has improved. In 1960, women were paid around 61 cents on the dollar compared with men.

That's not always, or even mostly, the case. Stock-market turbulence, both in the U.S. and China, is widely thought to have been the main reason why the Fed didn't raise interest rates this September, for instance.

The notion is that when stock markets get rough, Fed officials will rush to the rescue.

The FBI has been placing more of a focus on connected toys in recent months, said Jim Ivers, the vice president of marketing for the Software Integrity Group at Synopsys. The protection of children is a pretty emotional subject, he said. If child safety starts being compromised and manufacturers don't start looking out for it themselves, the government is going to step in and regulate. Although the FBI recommended parents check the background of the toys they buy their children, he said there is no central location to do that. It comes down to parents taking action regarding each particular toy, he said.

So far, Connecticut is leading the charge on these efforts, but Lesser said he's heard from lawmakers in other states interested in introducing similar legislation. In addition to the Bill of Rights, Lesser worked with his colleagues on the higher education committee to lower interest rates on state-sponsored student loans and to create a vehicle to allow borrowers to refinance their debt at lower interest rates, a step other states and localities are taking as well.
The failure to consider real-world data and outcomes around higher education financing does a massive disservice to students and to the U.S. economy. Students, especially when pursuing graduate programs, may incur debt without receiving information needed to make informed decisions. Neither the student nor the government lender is assessing the borrower's true ability to repay.

Semiconductor stocks in general have officially entered downturn territory, said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, in a note late last week. Many chip companies are seeing revenue slow, some of it due to tariffs on Chinese goods, or due to uncertainty because of the tariffs and the malaise in the global economy. This quarter, outlook will again be key for insight as to whether the current downturn will be swift or slow, but Rasgon said investors are now nervous that more cuts to estimates and spending loom ahead.

We think it's because the more times physicians interact with someone from the pharmaceutical industry, the easier it is to build a relationship of trust, she said.

Moves lower come ahead of President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech later Tuesday and as investors await the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. Rising yields have contributed to concerns as well, with the 10-year Treasury yield climbing above 2.72% for the first time in three years.
The start of trading in the New Year has been ugly as companies begin to sound the earnings alarm, an obvious impact of the trade war. While we do expect a decrease in overall profits, it is obvious that multinationals will bear the brunt of the trade war as earnings miss their forecast, wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, in a research note.
Foreign investors plowed around $170 billion into the assets in 2017, up from $99 billion in 2016, according to data from the Institute of International Finance, a global financial industry trade group
Right now, about 64% of inmates in state and federal prison are academically qualified to take college courses, according to the report, but most don't have access to these programs and even if they do, they likely can't afford the tuition, diZerega said.In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, just 9% of incarcerated people received a certificate from a higher education institution while in prison.
In an effort to combat fraudulent unemployment insurance claims, which have been rampant in some states during the pandemic, gig workers and self-employed workers will be required to provide documentation of their earnings to get unemployment benefits under the new stimulus package.
However, a report from researchers at the left-leaning Brookings Institution found that homes in similar neighborhoods with similar amenities were assessed as being worth 23% less in majority-Black neighborhoods, compared to areas with few Black residents. Altogether, this amounts to over $156 billion in losses for black homeowners, researchers found.

Fed officials generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation, according to the minutes.
The economic softness comes as investors are concerned about a protracted tariff dispute between Beijing and Washington, which analysts have said could aggravate a retrenchment in both economies.
Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said on Monday said that economic circumstances have evolved and now imply the need for a different stance of monetary policy. That calls for somewhat more regular increases in short-term interest rates, he said.
Comments coming from both parties continue to indicate that the talks are, so far going 'very well.' A deal is likely to still be a long way off, with many twists and turns still to overcome along the way, he said. However, the extension is a step in the right direction, sending a signal that the two sides are in serious negotiations and are working hard to resolve the issues.
The Biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. Families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. Apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.
Austerity has been the most damaging policy mistake in economics in recent years, said Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The risks to investors in even U.S. Treasury bonds are rising (and lenders are right to demand higher interest rates)

And there are more ways in which waiving appraisals can cause issues for the housing market. Once an appraisal is completed, the data collected on that property is then fed into computer models that provide the comp values appraisers compare to produce their next appraisal. Should the number of waivers granted continue to increase, that could cause problems down the road.
Allow me to put your credit-card debt into perspective. A $7,000 credit balance with an 18% annual rate, with a minimum payment of 2% of the balance, or $10, whichever is greater, would take 188 months or just nearly 16 years to pay off. Making minimum payments on your credit card is a long road to nowhere, and making no payments will lead to debt collectors and more stress.
The largest employers in America used to be huge industrial conglomerates that offered secure, well-paid, lifetime careers. Now the largest employers are retailers such as Wal-Mart WMT, -0.81% , Kroger KR, -1.45% and Home Depot HD, +0.84% , which have high turnover and low wages.
Marketing and advertising works, said Dr. Timothy Brennan, director of the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai West and Mount Sinai St. Luke's Hospitals. That doesn't mean that these physicians are corrupt or egregious prescribers, but pharmaceutical companies wouldn't be paying for these dinners if they didn't work, he said.
As far as the chargemasters being made available online they will be of very little use to the majority of patients, said Caitlin Donovan, director and spokeswoman for National Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit based in Virginia. I doubt most hospitals went through to make these as consumer-friendly as possible.
European stocks finished at their lowest in a week Thursday, as investors considered a signal from the European Central Bank that it's positioning for a more hawkish view on monetary policy.
 In 2014, Royal Caribbean only offered a 50% refund on the cruise fare and a 50% credit toward a future cruise.

In Canada, authorities issued a public health notice saying that initial findings indicate that contaminated romaine lettuce was the source of the outbreak. The nation's Public Health Agency went so far as to recommend residents of five provinces consider consuming other types of lettuce, instead of romaine lettuce, until more is known about the outbreak and the cause of contamination.
It isn't just Trump, Canally said. There are other things going on here.
Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% shares rose 1.7%. Reports indicated that the tech behemoth was set to cut iPhone production by 10% this quarter. But Chief Executive Tim Cook, during a CNBC interview on Tuesday, described the long-term health of the company as never been better, and said the ecosystem around the company's roster of products has never been stronger.
A number of other Wall Street banks — including Deutsche Bank DB, +2.70% , an institution President-elect Trump does much of his business with — are facing similar charges, according to regulatory filings. Such conduct hasn't until recently been a target of FCPA prosecutions.
Japan's Nikkei NIK, +1.01% turned positive after spending most of the morning in the red— it closed up 0.4%. This is as the yen USDJPY, +0.03% fell further during Asian trade; it was last down 0.7% against the dollar. A weak yen makes the country's exporters more competitive.
Of course, in addition to a wage gap within occupations, there is also a wage gap between occupations. Previous Institute for Women's Policy Research analysis has found that more than one in four employed women in the U.S. are concentrated in low-wage service work, such as teaching young children, cleaning, serving, and caring for elders. Workers in these majority-female jobs are also disproportionately women of color, Hegewisch said.

On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said a bond-buying recalibration could happen in 2021.
Inflation would still be, I think, in a range that it wouldn't be affecting decision-making by households or firms but would give you a little more flexibility to reduce the probability that you hit zero during recessions. So if we were to have a recession right now, most recessions we move interest rates by much more than 300 basis points. If you look at where the [Fed forecasts] in December had the fed funds in the long run, [2.8%] it is low enough that more than likely in most recessions we'd hit zero. That is a concern.
U.S. antitrust enforcement risks neutering Big Tech leaders by limiting their scope to branch out into new businesses or breaking them up altogether. That risks leaving America challenged to match Chinese manufactures like Huawei and software wonders like WeChat and reducing America to a technological vassal state in an emerging Chinese technological empire.
The 10-year Treasury yield note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y hit a peak near 1.06%, marking its highest level since March. Higher yields can undercut appetite for safe-haven gold, which doesn't offer a coupon.
Note carefully that even if the MY ratio's forecast turns out to be right, it applies to the longer-term: The stock market should be materially higher in 10 to 15 years' time. The ratio doesn't have any ability to predict the stock market's shorter-term gyrations. So it would not be inconsistent with its forecast of a much higher stock market in the 2030s for equities to suffer a number of cyclical bear markets along the way.

Based on current trends, we will soon be facing rates of elder poverty unseen since the Great Depression. Of the 18 million workers between ages 55 and 64 in 2012, 4.3 million were projected to be poor or near-poor when they turn 65, including 2.6 million who were part of the middle class before reaching retirement age.

Equally, the U.K. should not pin undue hopes on China. Yes, China has many people; has had a fast-growing economy; has a lot of borrowable savings; and so on. But the U.K. is not important to China; and nor is the U.K. likely to be able to influence it.

Speaking of his teammates, he added, Every single one of them said they've got my back and love me.

Fears of a looming teacher shortage were growing even before the pandemic. Over the past decade the number of students studying to be educators has plummeted and the pandemic may only exacerbate some districts' challenges in finding teachers. Nearly 27% of educators said they were considering leaving the profession or taking a leave of absence because of COVID-19, according to a November survey published by Horace Mann Educators Corporation, which offers insurance and other financial products to educators.

7. Increased child- and dependent-care credits
The debt limit continues to constrain Treasury's flexibility in financing and they urge Congress to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible. Treasury continues to expect that they can fund the government through the end of January. The increases in coupon supply will eat into available borrowing authority and will further limit bill issuance until the debt ceiling is raised, said Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies, in a note.
All it took was one stellar economic data point to change the stock market's mood and punt the indexes higher. But even before the robust jobs numbers exorcised the demons, strategists had started to predict that the market is gearing up for a comeback given the depth of the recent selloff.
In particular, experts pointed out a number of concerns tied to appraisal waivers, one of the proposals the FHFA is exploring. The problem with a waiver is you don't know what you don't know, said Joan Trice, CEO of the Collateral Risk Network, an organizer of appraisers and risk managers. You didn't send an appraiser into that house. How do you know they didn't gut it and run out of money? You have no idea.
The headline number was weaker and the revisions weren't great, Luke Bartholomew, investment strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said of the jobs report and the lower wage growth number. The Phillips curve is still missing in action. But I think to say that the Fed made a policy error in December is too strong. For all its weakness, the report was still far from catastrophe.
HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — It used to be that investors outside China could ignore the gyrations in that country's stock market, given that no foreign investors were allowed to buy shares. But that's clearly not the case anymore as declines in Shanghai SHCOMP, +0.51% and botched circuit-breaker curbs helped push the U.S. Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38% to its worst four-day start to a year on record.

Almost half of the 134 U.S. chief executive officers surveyed by the New York Times last month said they expect the U.S. economy to be in recession by the end of 2019. That forecast was echoed by almost half of the chief financial officers who participated in the Duke University/CFO Global Business Outlook survey in December. (It would appear that the inhabitants of the C Suite communicate with one another!)

The backdrop for stocks is positive, with earnings growth still projected to be healthy, while the Fed looks like it is pausing, Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors, told MarketWatch.
The Dow DJIA, -0.46% is trading slightly lower, the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% is roughly flat, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -3.02% is up modestly in morning action. That's after all three gauges sagged yesterday, with some pinning the slump on President-elect Donald Trump waving adios to a longstanding strong dollar policy.
Blitz expects the U.S. and China will reach a lasting truce, the Fed will recalibrate the pace of its balance-sheet runoff and the government, of course, will reopen. What matters is the timing of these developments in determining how quickly markets respond before greater damage is done to the economy, he said.
It's a really exciting time, said Andrea Johnson, senior counsel for state policy at the National Women's Law Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for women's equality. Progress has been stalled in Congress and at the federal level, but things have really been happening at the state level.
The Biden tax plan would: (1) eliminate the $25,000 exemption from the passive loss rules for rental real estate losses incurred by middle-income individuals, (2) eliminate Section 1031 like-kind exchanges that allow deferral of capital gains taxes on swaps of appreciated real property, (3) eliminate rules that allow faster depreciation write-offs for certain real property, and (4) eliminate qualified business income (QBI) deductions for profitable rental real estate activities.

Tuesday, Jan 29: MPs will vote on May's proposal and others. The U.K. parliament is believed to have a majority against the idea of crashing out of the EU without any withdrawal agreement in place, with many MPs fearing serious economic disruption.
Workers under 30 are more likely to identify as do it for me investors than workers over 30, expressing that they want advice from investment professionals, and indicating they would appreciate notifications such as alerts when they are not saving enough, according to J.P. Morgan Asset Management. They also prefer features in their 401(k) plans such as automatic enrollment and automatic contribution escalation. Such nudges could prove effective, especially when Transamerica reports that 52% of millennials surveyed admit that they guessed the figure needed to save for retirement and only 10% used a retirement calculator or work sheet.

The global stock-market turmoil so far this year has been driven by a non-stop flow of economic reports indicating a slowdown. If you're a long-term investor, you may be wondering how much market events in China should affect your strategy.
The healthy report comes on the heels of a statement from China's Commerce Ministry confirming that a delegation of U.S. trade officials would meet with their Chinese counterparts Monday and Tuesday, news reports said, marking the first time the two sides have met since President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a 90-day trade truce last month.

Things are changing obviously, he said. After years of slow recovery and weak inflation, unemployment is at 4.7%, near many estimates of the sustainable rate of unemployment below which might spark inflation.
Still, others advised caution on deaths of despair estimates. We do not actually know that these deaths are increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor of emergency medicine and public health at Brown University, and Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis.
Stigmatization, bullying, low self-esteem and young people's exclusion from opportunities for social interaction are suggested as underlying any relationship between obesity and lower educational attainment, they found.
It's the dreaded question in the interview process because we all know it's often a very unfair question to ask, Johnson said. When we take a step back and look at it, it's forcing women to take pay disparity with them from job to job.

It's not just blue states like California and New York that are taking action. Mississippi has been considering a law to address pay disparities between men and women, Johnson said. It's not only about women, it's about their families, too. It's incredibly important to overall economic well-being and it's really exciting to see states stepping up.
The only thing that goes up in falling markets is correlation (when stock and bond markets decline everything declines in value especially riskless investments) The Smart Money on Wall Street, and even Main Street, invests in only one type of investment: what they feel are undervalued securities. Today there are well over 1000 different sector funds and ETFs available. Sector funds (in which we recommend you invest) allow you to scan the horizon for rallying sectors. When the Smart Money investors identify an undervalued sector, their investment money start to invest in that sector, they will drive up the price of that sector; the more narrow the sector the more profound the market rise. A diversified portfolio of five or more sector funds allows diversification, liquidity and profit potential for investors. If you have gone to cash before the correction, you will have more money to invest in the recovering markets and you can afford to diversify among a number of sector funds increases the odds of finding a few sectors that generate significant capital gains. Given the longer-term momentum of well-undervalued securities in a down market, you have greater odds of earning tax-preferred long-term capital gains as we did with most of our largest portfolio allocations in 2013 and 2014. Lower long-term capital-gains profits reduce total return-oriented risk. Remember you only have to hold on for a year to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% fell 0.3% on Tuesday. The bigger impact was seen in financial stocks in the U.S. thanks to a drop in the yield on the 10-year Treasury notes, with the S&P 500 financials sub index sinking 2.3% overnight.

This could be far more important than the Fed. A lot of major trends start with Japan. People don't focus on Japan enough in my view, he added.
In 2014, for instance, nonfinancial corporations in the aggregate returned $388 billion more to investors than they received in initial or secondary public offerings. Since 1993, the total amount of capital that the market has taken away from corporations is around $5 trillion.
Fitch Ratings said emerging market corporations flogging bonds were seeing a rapid improvement in their finances.

The government's unemployment rate hovered at 6.7% in December, and the number of unemployed workers was 10.7 million. However, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, argues that a breakdown of government figures and other estimates based on those paint a far bleaker picture due to the business closures and public-health restrictions related to COVID-19: 26.8 million workers are being negatively affected — or nearly 16% of the workforce.
The Federal Reserve appears to have succeeded where other central banks have failed — at least in convincing markets that it will be more dovish in the years ahead, said former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Sunday.
Ellevest is a robo adviser designed specifically for women, taking into account likely gaps in pay and investment in recommending products and strategies.

The News Implied Sentiment Indicator, or NISI, has reversed most of its postelection rise, as the chart from the Citigroup team of macro analysts illustrates:
Listings may include coding for different services that make very little sense to the average consumer, according to Donovan. Codes in one database at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, for example, read as HC ARC PLT AB DRUG INCUBATION ($931) and HC ARC SEPARATION BY DENSITY GRADIENT RETICS ($1095) and HC BME POST BM MONO ($1098). Those are incomprehensible to most people looking to compare prices, Donovan said. The best way to straighten out pricing dilemmas is to call your insurance company directly.
Rebecca Fender, the head of future of finance at CFA Institute, said about 18% of financial advisers are women. We are looking to profile more of the successful women in our industry, she told MarketWatch. It's an important element to attract women into the industry. Visibility is validity. She was surprised, she said, by the size of the gender wage gap for financial advisers and hopes that more firms disclose wage data. We don't think there should be a wage gap for doing similar work.
Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said he expected only one rate increase in 2019.

Opinion is divided along political lines: 91% Republican respondents said they supported Trump's stance on immigration, versus 42% of Independents and 14% of Democrats. The rhetoric leaves a growing number of Americans who have real questions about immigration with no place to go, Ali Noorani, executive director for the National Immigration Forum, told PBS Newshour last month. Views on immigration even among members of political parties appear more complex when the questions are more nuanced.
It's tempting to dismiss the recent turn in bearish sentiment as a rite of spring, and that the pace at which yields have climbed has taken the move beyond its moorings.
The 'demand side' is missing from the teacher shortage equation
The gender wage gap for women of color continues to indicate a marked earnings inequality for Hispanic and black women, the Census Bureau previously found. For every dollar earned by a white man, Hispanic women earned 54 cents and black women earned 63 cents in 2015. Black women's earnings increased by 9% to $36,212 a year from $33,225 per year, compared with rises of 4.3% for Asian women, 2.6% for Hispanic women, and 2.8 % for Caucasian women.
Shalett referred to the federal-funds rate and the three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate. Both are now safely above zero, she wrote, adding that the two-year Treasury yield is around 2% TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.165% , marking the first time since 2009 that the real yield—the nominal yield adjusted for inflation—is positive.
Asian equity markets reversed early gains to end broadly lower on Thursday, as investors sought to take profits amid the prevailing global political uncertainties.
Buy low, sell high is always good advice, and we have sold high on our advice of going 100% to cash stands strong. The mechanical technical recommendations continue to sour quickly as momentum remains frustratingly unsustainable; our advice (remember we have over nine years of following this strategy and can recognize when it makes recommendations that are at that point in the cycle unlikely to be wise advice) is still to hold 100% in cash.
For all this we can thank the millennial generation, which consists of those who were born in the 1980s and 1990s. Though that generation isn't as big as the infamous baby boom generation that preceded them, it is still big enough to represent a powerful economic force.
In London, a 6% drop dragged Royal Mail RMG, +1.58% shares to the bottom of the FTSE 100. The delivery company said U.K. sales declined 2% in the nine months to Dec. 25. But trading was in line with expectations, it said, as strong performance over Christmas helped counter those poor figures.
Despite these obstacles, Fox said she's still motivated to become a teacher so that she can provide students with opportunities to engage with material in ways they haven't before. As a young student herself, Fox said she didn't learn to love reading and literature until she got to engage with plays. Now Fox is a creative writing minor. She said she wants to provide similar aha moments for her students.
UBS AG agreed to pay a $15 million, without admitting or denying the allegations, for an alleged scheme by some precious metals traders on its spot desk.
We were going to meet and start talking about strategies for encouraging people to go into the teaching profession, Larson said. Those tactics include fostering interest in teaching as a second career or creating an affordable path to a teaching license for professionals with an aptitude for teaching. We have a lot of really talented instructional assistants in this state and oftentimes the only reason they're not certified teachers is because they didn't have the time or money to go to college, he said.
Genworth Financial GNW, -1.42% , the reinsurance business that GE spun off in 2004, disclosed in a routine SEC filing that year that periodic reviews of claim reserves are common and charges are to be expected. Since 2004, Genworth Financial has disclosed nine changes in estimates related to its long-term care portfolio, totaling $3.8 billion.
According to Daiwa Research, today's yuan gap down is likely due to continued capital outflows and stronger yuan selling pressure after the holidays. They contend Beijing is trying to orchestrate an orderly currency adjustment lower, a view supported by the December change in moving to valuation based on a trade-weighted basket.
The difference between the 10-year Treasury note's yield and the two-year Treasury note's yield has now shrunk to 50 basis points. This is the definition of a shrinking yield curve slope, which is completely normal in a mature economic expansion (see chart).
11. Financial advisers can add value, but only if they are experts and have very high ethical standards. Look for advisers who possess a Certified Financial Planner certification (73,000+ in the U.S. now), as a baseline indication of competency. The CPA/PFS (personal financial specialist), Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and Chartered Financial Consultant designations are also worthwhile. Most of the other 200 or more designations don't pass muster.
Today's younger workers are more likely to work in nontraditional job settings and more likely to switch jobs than other age groups, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. The median job tenure among workers age 25 to 34 (2.8 years) is less than one-third of older workers age 55 to 64 (10.1 years). What's more, 55% of jobs held by those ages 18 to 28 lasted less than one year, and 70% of jobs lasted no more than two years. The challenges that come with frequent job changes include not staying long enough to become fully vested in the company 401(k) plan, the failure to roll over their retirement savings into new retirement plans, or forgetting about their account altogether when they change jobs.
On other subjects, Cook touted the success of its wearables and teased an upcoming service, possibly related to health care. You will see us announce new services this year. There will more things coming, he said. On the health care, in particular, and sorta your well-being, this is an area that I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind,' it will be about health.
With control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.
Basically there's a big bottleneck in the process at this point, said David Baime, the senior vice president for government relations and policy analysis at the American Association of Community Colleges.
Fear is on the rise. Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.
Risk number one is associated with the transition to the Trump administration, a hard turn toward protectionism. That's certainly something we got our eye on that I think is a downside risk to the global economy, he said.

• The head of the World Health Organization said that he is disappointed Chinese officials haven't finalized the permissions to allow a team of experts into China to examine the origins of COVID-19, the Associated Press reported. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a rare critique of Beijing, said members of the international scientific team began departing from their home countries over the last 24 hours as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government. Today, we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalized the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China, Tedros said during a news conference in Geneva. I'm very disappointed with this news, given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute, but had been in contact with senior Chinese officials, he said.
The British pound GBPUSD, -0.14% was trading at $1.3774 from $1.3727 late Friday. Sterling on Monday has climbed as high as $1.3820, its best level against the buck since the U.K.'s June 2016 vote to leave the European Union, or Brexit.

But Matthew Hornbach of Morgan Stanley said that outside of recessions, only one in four times when the Treasury Department unloaded a wave of supply did yields rise over recent history. Moreover, prices adjust much less on an outright basis when the actual supply hits the market than when expectations for an influx of supply started to build, he said. Forward-looking investors already had a strong inkling of upcoming bond issuance.
Things are moving in the right direction, Evans said.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Inflation is likely to move back to the U.S. central bank's 2% annual target in the near-term, said Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, on Thursday. After the price of oil bottoms out, I would expect to see headline inflation move significantly higher, Lacker said in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Raleigh, N.C. Most Fed officials, including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen have been more cautious, saying that inflation will move higher over a more loosely-defined medium term. Lacker is a hawk on the Fed's interest rate committee, having dissented at the Fed's September and October meetings in favor of an increase in interest rates. He is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year.

Worries originated in China, where the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.51% slid almost 7% on the back of a weak manufacturing reading. The slide activated a new circuit-breaker system for Chinese stocks, halting trading on the mainland for the rest of the day and rekindling fears of a repeat of last August's plunge, when another selloff in China's stock market sparked an unraveling of stocks around the world.
The pre-election Biden tax plan would raise the top individual federal income rate on ordinary income and net short-term capital gains back to 39.6%, the top rate that was in effect before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) lowered it to 37% for 2018-2025. Biden also said he would generally raise taxes on folks with incomes above $400,000 without supplying specifics.

To switch from a tax-deferred retirement savings accounts to a potentially tax-free Roth IRA savings account. Waiting to do so will only require that you pay higher income taxes in the future on hopefully additional savings (you can't believe federal income tax rates will fall); they will most likely rise, and you can manage the state income tax bill on your tax-deferred savings by relocating, if appropriate, as soon as possible, then converting. If that involves a change of employer, you have an ideal opportunity to convert all of your 401(k) and/or 403b balances to Roth accounts at the time.
The legislation also calls for an 11-week extension of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which allows self-employed workers, independent contractors and gig workers to continue to collect unemployment benefits.
Interestingly, researchers found the number of payments to doctors in an area had the greatest association with prescription numbers and opioid-related overdose deaths, more so than even the amount paid. Areas with a higher number of payments per capita saw increased opioid prescribing rates and more opioid-related overdose deaths.
But other research indicates that some students are working too much or have erratic hours, and that can interfere with their success in school, Kelchen noted. These days, given the high cost of college and the shifting demographics of college students — increasingly towards adults, parents and those from low-income backgrounds — very few college students are immune from the pressure to work while in school and, in some cases, they may be working so much to afford college that their education is put at risk.

Between 2007 and 2015, our estimate is that roughly 3 million first-time home buyers delayed buying a home, and they're reaching that age when they can no longer delay, Liu says.

So I think those drivers will be very significant for the next few years.

Of course, simply belonging to this relatively well-off, but newly tax-disadvantaged bracket doesn't guarantee your taxes will increase.

But for both men and women in New York state, that's about to change. As of last year, employees who work at least 20 hours a week at private employers will get 50% of their salaries, capped at $652 a week, for eight weeks when they need time to bond with a new baby or adopted child or care for a sick relative. Employees will be eligible for more pay and more time off as the law expands over the next few years. By 2021, employees will receive 67% of their salary for up to 12 weeks. New York follows in the footsteps of California, New Jersey and Rhode Island, the only other states to require paid family leave.

Struggling to pay student debt? Here's what you need to know.
WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Friday he thinks the central bank will only raise interest rates twice this year, one fewer than the central bank's median forecast of three moves. In a speech at the American Economic Association meeting in Philadelphia, Harker said the central bank will be in monitoring mode this year. There is a lot to watch generally, and much of it, in some form or another, is new territory, Harker said. The Philadelphia Fed president said he expects growth a little below 2.5% this year. He forecast that inflation will rise above the Fed's 2% target in 2019. If soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem, he said. Harker is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate policy committee this year.

Trump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program — tweeting that it was up to the states to administer and then calling some states very slow — meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.

While reconciliation could be powerful tool — especially if Democrats use it twice in one year, as Republicans did in 2017 — the narrow margins in both chambers mean leaders will have to thread the needle in writing bills. Repealing some of the 2017 tax cuts would meet the rules and have broad Democratic support, for example, while the Green New Deal would likely have a tougher time on both counts.

But the EPI's analysis suggested bigger profits would likely not be redistributed among workers, but rather go into the pockets of owners. To truly help back-of-house, low-income workers, wages need to be increased and employers should not be allowed to take tips, she added. There is far more incentive for them to pocket that money than to give it to employees, she said.

Rosengren: Just having the data from the spring time roll off – we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that I think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so I think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. In addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. If we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. You're already hearing lots of stories, I think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. These things take time. They don't happen overnight. That's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. I do expect that over time it will have that impact. We'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.

So even while we're tightening with monetary policy, in some sense we have a more stimulative fiscal policy and over the course of the year people didn't know what, if any, tax change would occur. And now we know a tax change has actually occurred, so we now have a stimulative environment from the fiscal policy side that we didn't necessarily know was going to happen, so short-term interest rates have tightened but the long rate TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% is a little less than 2.5% right now. I would expect over time that it will gradually increase as we unwind our balance sheet and as it becomes clear that inflation really is picking up towards our 2% goal and that the tight labor markets are starting to have an impact on wages and prices over time.
The geopolitical situation is replete with opportunities for disruption and chaos.
Longer-term positive influences from fiscal-policy improvements, instead of monetary-policy stimulus, are clear. Still, those positives won't be immediate.

2) Dollar strength and more emphasis on other currencies. Traditionally, Chinese authorities mostly reference the dollar-yuan rate when discussing its currency.

He also says bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.89% is susceptible to toughened regulation from Treasury secretary nominee Janet Yellen. I don't think governments and central banks would, or should, and maybe even can't, destroy bitcoin, but they can make life very, very difficult and lower priced, he says. There is also competition coming from the digital dollar, euro and yen that will have central bank backing.

The piece says incumbent Democrats are most annoyed by the New York congresswoman's threat to back primary opponents against members of their ranks she deems too moderate. Also, Democratic leaders are upset that she railed against their new set of House rules on Twitter the first week of the new Congress.

16. Plan for 2025. That's about the time we should have self-driving cars. And, as you get older, time proceeds faster (in your perception), which slows your reaction times. These and other factors tend to make driving skills decline over time. With self-driving cars will come far fewer accidents, and car ownership will change. More and more people will have shared cars (just call up a car, using an app), which should cut the cost of car ownership and use dramatically. And, it will aid many older retirees to maintain mobility. So, if you plan to purchase a car anytime soon, plan to keep it for 10 years, and realize that this might be the last car you purchase in your lifetime, as you will rent self-driving cars in the future.

Still health-care costs have spun out of sight, because the Affordable Care Act enables drug companies, hospitals, large insurers and large-group practices of specialists to monopolize and impose outlandish prices in national and regional markets.
So, the difference between where we are now versus 12 months ago, says Lapthorne, is that share prices have been losing ground, and if you have leverage and your share price is weak, that compounds the problem. On a 12-month basis, the Russell 2000 has lost nearly 8% against a 5.7% drop for the S&P 500.

Beijing is now walking a delicate path, as the more expectations grow of currency weakness, the greater the risks of a stampede in capital outflows.

Most of us believe, as economic theory teaches, that a stock market is an efficient way of transferring capital from those who have a little extra money (savers) to those who have good uses for it (entrepreneurs). When we put money into the market, we imagine that our pennies and dollars are funding productive investments in corporations.

If you lived in California you are paying as much as 13% state income taxes; I was and a few years back I moved to first Texas and then Washington State and saved one-third of my income tax bill. You should do the same. All it takes to be a resident of an income-tax-fee state is to visit the state looking for a future home (your hotel bill is your proof). You owe it to yourself, your spouse and your family to at least consider the move.
However, 12% of tipped workers had tips stolen by their employer or supervisor, according to a 2009 study from Center for Urban Economic Development, often leading to minimum wage violations. The ruling would also disproportionately affect non-white employees: White non-Hispanic tipped workers would lose $3.5 billion, Hispanic workers would lose $1.4 billion, black non-Hispanic tipped workers would lose $486 million, Asian workers would lose $391 million, and tipped workers who are of another race would lose $104 million, according to the Economic Policy Institute.

14. Have a fee-only financial planner undertake a comprehensive review of all of your various types of insurance—home, auto, umbrella, life, health (including Medicare Part C or D, Medigap), long-term care, etc. Most retirees tend to have too much for some types of insurance, and too little for other types—or, by not shopping around every couple of years, they are paying far too much relative to other, lower-cost policies.
CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — Economic conditions are likely to call for two interest-rate hikes in 2017, but a forecast of three hikes is not implausible, said Chicago Fed President Charles Evans on Friday.

6. Freeze your credit – even if you don't suspect any foul play. This can protect you from people taking out credit cards and loans in your name in the future – and as data breaches and identity theft are becoming more and more frequent, this may be smarter than ever. All three major credit agencies, Equifax, Experian and Transunion, allow you to freeze your credit file for free. Best of all, it only takes a few minutes to 'thaw' when you need to have your report pulled. This is the best way to be proactive in protecting your credit, says Hockenbury.
Modernizing the appraisal process could have unintended consequences
Marler further suggested consumers avoid everything from sprouts (a notable E. coli outbreak stemming from sprouts sickened roughly 3,000 people in Germany in 2011), raw juices and milk. And consumers should certainly steer clear of under-cooked meat, unpasteurized raw eggs and raw shellfish. And pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems may want to put the fork down where cantaloupe is concerned, since it is a common source of listeria — a 2011 listeria outbreak tied to the melon was responsible for more than 30 deaths.

We revised up our global growth and inflation forecasts for the next two years for the first time since early 2012 (albeit only in line with the mediocre growth rates of recent years), with the upgrade coming from developed economies. Expectations may be getting too high, though, said Janet Henry, chief global economist with HSBC Bank. An upturn in the global industrial cycle does not tell us much about long-term growth prospects, especially while protectionism is a real threat.

Draghi's comments were interpreted as an acknowledgment there's little the ECB can do to arrest the euro's rise in the near term. A stronger euro can hurt exports and weigh on inflation, potentially hurting the recovery. That's also why stocks headed lower after the euro jumped above $1.25.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday jumped to a fresh peak as a trio of bankers, headlined by current Chairman Jerome Powell, underscored the health of the U.S. economy but also expressed an attentiveness to a market that has grown fragile amid a spate of interest-rate increases. The Dow DJIA, -0.39% was up 616 points, or 2.7%, at 23,291, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% climbed 2.8% at 2,515, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% advanced 3.2%, producing the best intraday gains, to reach 6,671. The moves follow a better-than-expected job report that showed that 312,000 jobs were created in December, with the unemployment rate rising to 3.9%, as more workers entered the workforce. Against that backdrop, Powell, during an panel discussion featuring former Fed bosses, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at an event in Atlanta, said the employment report underlined the economy's health. He also said that the central bank would be willing to adjust policy if it disrupted the market or created adverse financial conditions, running against the central bank's statutory goals. The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since the end of 2015.

Wilson believes the market is too damaged and there is too much resistance for stocks to climb straight up. He also noted that financial conditions continue to deteriorate despite the Fed's more dovish tone, and without the central bank backing off from its tighter policy regime, it will be tough for the market to support a rally above 2,600-2,650.

Still, you wouldn't be the first second wife to want to claim a life insurance policy that was written for her husband's first family. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of a 66-year-old man's ex-wife (rather than his widow) as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy worth over $124,000. In this case, he may not have wanted his ex-wife, who he divorced 10 years before his death, to claim his life insurance policy. But with or without a divorce decree, the document given to the insurance company had his ex-wife's name on it.

Under price-level targeting, the Fed would commit to keeping the price level on a path defined by a 2% inflation rate, Bullard said.

But the tax transcript service is currently down. Officials at the Department of Education and the IRS told Politico the outage isn't due to the shutdown and they expect the tool to be back up on January 14. In the meantime, while the shutdown persists, borrowers trying to get their tax information will likely struggle to find someone to take their calls at the IRS, Kantrowitz said.
Productivity: The firm becomes more productive, increasing its stream of revenues. This increases the size of both slices, including the shareholders' slice. Redistribution: The size of the pie remains fixed, but the firm pays a smaller share to the workers, increasing the shareholders' slice. Market confidence: Neither the size nor the division of the pie changes, but more risk-tolerant investors demand more stock despite there being no change in their current dividends.

It might seem like a bit of a chicken-and-egg conundrum. After all, the yen rally is usually attributed to haven flows amid market turmoil. But analysts note the yen has tended to have a strong inverse relationship with the Nikkei NIK, +1.01% and other equities, including the S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% .
Not everyone believes the pace of home prices will slow in 2019. One outlier is Fannie Mae, another government-sponsored enterprise. It forecasts that median prices for existing homes will go up 4.7% in 2019, compared with 4.5% in 2018. (The housing market is big, and Fannie Mae, NAR and other market participants don't always end up with the same estimates.)

More than one-third of the American workforce are freelancers and independent contractors and they're expected to be the majority by 2027, according to the Freelancers Union. But in most states, they have no recourse if they want to take action against a sexual harasser. That's because protections against workplace harassment fall under federal anti-discrimination laws that only cover full-time employees. In April 2018, New York became the latest state to extend sexual harassment protections to freelance workers and contractors.

Trump's now calling for a weaker dollar but inflation has already breached the Fed's 2% target, he said. That makes gold look good for 2017, because as real interest rates fall, the currency will devalue at a faster rate.
The dollar had rallied and gold wavered in the immediate wake of Trump's election win on speculation he would usher in potentially inflationary pro-growth policies. The dollar rallied to a 14-year high but has since retreated, helping gold to rebound as the market grew weary waiting on details.

Upper-income individuals would face higher capital gains taxes under the Biden plan. Under current law, the maximum effective federal income tax rate on net long-term capital gains and qualified dividends recognized by individual taxpayers is 23.8%, as explained in the main body of this column. Under the Biden plan, net long-term gains (and presumably dividends) collected by those with incomes above $1 million would be taxed at the same 39.6% maximum rate that is proposed for ordinary income and net short-term capital gains. With the 3.8% NIIT add-on, the maximum effective rate on net long-term gains would 43.4% (39.6% plus 3.8%). That would be almost double the current maximum effective rate of only 23.8%.

Baime said his organization has heard from its member schools with great concern about students unable to complete their FAFSA due to the tax transcript issue. Unfortunately, this issue is likely affecting students who need the funds the most — college officials say they observe that low-income students are more likely to be flagged for verification. In some cases, colleges are working with students to allow them to start the semester in the absence of financing until the issues are resolved, Baime said.

Bad times tend to be better for women to be given a chance to be CEOs, said Ariane Hegewisch, program director of employment and earnings at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. When a company isn't doing well and everyone shies away from it, companies think 'we've tried the usual, now let's give an outsider a chance.'

The Producer Price Index showed wholesale prices increased by 1.6% in 2016, roughly in line with economists' expectations.

President Donald Trump said privately several times last year that he wanted to withdraw the U.S. from NATO, the New York Times reported Monday night. Citing senior administration officials, the Times said the idea was expressed around the tumultuous NATO summit last summer in Brussels, with Trump saying he didn't see the point of the U.S. belonging to NATO. Sources told the Times that they worry Trump could again seek to withdraw from NATO now that the calming influence of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is gone and as European military spending continues to lag. Experts told the Times that withdrawing from NATO would be a catastrophe for U.S. foreign policy, sabotaging 70 years of U.S. efforts and handing a huge victory to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly sought to undermine NATO.

Past years when stocks have gotten off to such a strong start have typically coincided with steep gains for the market overall. However, kicking January off with a rally hardly guarantees a smooth ride upward, and there may be no more dramatic illustration of this than 1987. While that year started with big gains, it was also the year of Black Monday, the Oct. 19 crash where 23% of market value was wiped out in a single session. However, the S&P still ended up 2% on the year in 1987.

The findings come amid increased urgency from both sides of the political aisle to address the consequences of mass incarceration on those who wind up in the criminal justice system and on society more broadly. The research suggests making college more affordable is one tool policymakers could use to mitigate some of these challenges.
A lot of the discussion around the pharmaceutical industry has been around high value payments, but what seems to matter is really the number of times doctors interact with the pharmaceutical industry, said Magdalena Cerdá, the study's senior author and director of the Center on Opioid Epidemiology and Policy at NYU Langone Health.

In the end, the events at the Capitol will not change the election outcome and likely raise the importance that the Democrats were able to pull off the 'Blue Wave,' he said, referring to the sweep of the White House and both chambers of Congress.
That will require the Democrats to shelve their tropism for higher taxes on upper-income Americans and for the president to give up on yet more budget-busting tax cuts. Alternatively, both sides could go after the carried interest tax break for Wall Street's financial engineers — those levy lower capital gains tax rates on income that should rightly be classified as wage income.
While the market has lately reacted negatively to any news that might encourage further rate hikes, Delwiche said, if the Fed is positioned to continue to raise rates in 2019 because the data warrants it, it's not such a scary thing for the stock market.
The views come at a time when valuation concerns are growing around both stocks and bonds. Equities have been on a tear for years, and last year major indexes hit a record number of all-time highs amid a backdrop bereft of volatility or significant pullbacks. Although few are forecasting a bull-market-killing recession, the current environment suggests less upside potential in stocks, along with the potential for more downside. At the same time, bond prices are expected to extend their downtrend, pushing yields which move inversely higher, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
One reason it's so difficult for people behind bars to take college courses — a provision in the 1994 crime bill banned them from accessing Pell grants. If lawmakers were to lift that ban, 463,000 incarcerated individuals would become eligible for the funds, the study found.

Based on Biden's comments, we can expect more stimulus spending by the federal government — possibly a lot more, which means an increase in the Federal Reserve's purchases of U.S. Treasury notes. That could very well mean another plunge in long-term interest rates and a continued flow of new money into the stock market.
More than a month later, I was contacted by a company representative agreeing to pay me $800: $700 for the EU Regulation 261/2004, $50 for my taxi home after my first canceled flight, and $50 for food I ate at the airport. The $800 I received minus the $100 in costs incurred at the airport and $260 in money I lost on the Airbnb left me with $440 in profit from my failed Paris trip. I may use that money toward planning another vacation to Europe in the new year. And what airline will I chose? Despite all the delays — Norwegian.

Hopper says a gradual rise in mortgage rates won't cause most prospective buyers to give up on homeownership. On a $300,000 home, an increase of a quarter or a half percentage point is only going to impact the payment by between $75 and $100 a month, he says, which isn't insignificant, but it's not necessarily something that impacts the buying decision.

For example, we estimate that if there had been no redistributive shifts since 1980, which mostly went in favor of shareholders, the level of the stock market in 2012 would have been only 56% of its observed value. However, these changes do not always favor shareholders. Case in point: the period from 1960 to 1980 saw substantial gains for workers at the expense of lower stock returns.

It may be tempting to fault the savers for this sad state of affairs, but it is wrong to blame the victim. Here is the hard truth: existing tools make it impossible for most people to afford to save enough for retirement, and employers are not bridging the gap. People could try to delay retiring, but for various reasons that isn't always the worker's choice to make. Even those with significant savings to invest commonly see subpar returns, due in large part to lack of financial literacy and an industry short on reliable advice. Financial advisers, whose fees to their clients cost savers an estimated $17 billion per year, often guide them into trouble.
Yellen went on to say that when the Fed is the culprit, it is generally because the central bank is forced to tighten policy to curtail inflation and ends up overplaying its hand. (She didn't mention that the Fed's monetary policy may have a hand in creating financial imbalances.)

Britain is well able to develop such an analysis. Conducted seriously, and delivered with humility, it would meet the domestic need, and could well be welcomed on the continent. But first that case has to be made. Only then would Prime Minister David Cameron be right to negotiate; and he would be wrong to press his case by threatening to leave.
The technology sector, when it's not crashing 2000-style, tends to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average over time as its member companies grow faster; so the present renewed leadership of the Nasdaq 100 is a positive sign for the stock market, and I would certainly be looking for the broader market (as represented by the S&P 500) to make new highs too.
But today's selloff could be attributed to the perceived lack of leadership in Washington, he said, as the shutdown underscores what could be a year of increased policy uncertainty, including questions surrounding U.S. trade policy.
8. Without a doubt, all retirees who choose to work with a financial planner should have their planner sign the Fiduciary Oath suggested by The Committee for the Fiduciary Standard, located here. If you have a current adviser, and that adviser won't sign the fiduciary oath within a reasonable time after being asked, that's a strong warning sign that the consumer should seek a second opinion from a fee-only financial planner/investment adviser.
However, Ranney and Gold said the projections in the Well Being Trust report should be taken with some serious caveats. These projections are based on data from the Great Recession, meaning the models weren't able to factor in the unique aspects of what is happening today, such as how new technologies make possible increased virtual social connection and support, they wrote.
At the ECB's last meeting, the central bank extended its bond-buying program by nine months, although it reduced the pace of its purchases beyond March. Any additional details on the political or monetary environment will be closely watched, especially as President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn in as the U.S.'s 45th president on Friday.

In early 2020, John Larson, the president of Oregon Education Association, the state's teacher's union, was preparing to head to Minneapolis for a national conference on what he and fellow teacher advocates were worried was becoming, as Larson put it, a crisis: Too few teachers to meet the needs of the nation's schools.
This makes life hard for the central bank. For instance, it makes it more difficult for the central bank to engineer a soft landing for the economy, Rosengren said. It also means the Fed cannot pause in its gradual pace of rate hikes and should even pick up the pace a bit this year. The U.S. central bank might have to raise rates four times in 2018, he said, more than the median forecast of Fed officials or the two hikes the market expects.
For 2018, the standard deduction amounts are $12,000 for single filers, $24,000 for married joint-filing couples, and $18,000 for heads of households. For 2019, the standard deduction amounts are $12,200, $24,400, and $18,350, respectively.

Now, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -1.31% is offering a new kind of solution, with a free product that allows consumers to safely and conveniently throw out what's left over of their medication.
A key reason China's stock turmoil has such a global impact is it is now coinciding with capital outflows and currency weakness. In fact, the beginning of large fund outflows can be traced back to the controversial stock intervention last summer, where Beijing's attempt to coerce markets faced widespread criticism.
However, only a few have enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement. In 2013, the median value of a retirement account for a household headed by someone near retirement was just $24,000. For the poorest half of the population, the median holding was less than $4,000.

The December ISM reading is the thin air of the high peaks, wrote Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Tim Quinlan, in a note.

Trump has never been clear and consistent about what he will do as president. Tax cuts are clearly on his agenda, and the stimulus could lead to higher asset prices. Lower corporate taxes are naturally supposed to lead to higher share prices, while cuts in personal income tax might lead to higher home prices (though possibly offset by other changes in the tax system).
According to Davis, the biggest IPO success story (in terms of organic job growth) since 2001 has been GameStop GME, +1.12% , the videogame retailer that has about 7,000 stores and 54,000 employees, most of them making less than $10 an hour.

So when it is time for us to sell, or even to stop buying, the response could be quite strong; there is every reason to expect a strong response. So there are a couple of ways to look at it. It is about $1.2 trillion in sales; you take 60 months, you get about $20 billion a month. That is a very doable thing, it sounds like, in a market where the norm by the middle of next year is $80 billion a month. Another way to look at it, though, is that it's not so much the sale, the duration; it's also unloading our short volatility position. When you turn and say to the market, 'I've got $1.2 trillion of these things,' it's not just $20 billion a month — it's the sight of the whole thing coming. And I think there is a pretty good chance that you could have quite a dynamic response in the market.
Analysts say the divergence between rising inflation forecasts and the muddled trading in government bonds has been underpinned by the possibility the Fed could still tweak its asset purchases to keep longer-dated rates anchored.
Powell's remarks suggested to some that the Fed may hike rates at a more measured pace, news that may provide long-term support for gold which tends to see weakened investment appetite when interest rates are competitively richer. Gold doesn't offer a yield.

Employers, especially those that do business in multiple states, should stay up to date on these new laws to make sure they're not running afoul of new regulations, Ilyse Schuman, an attorney with the global employment law firm Littler, told MarketWatch.

Helping the youngest workers today understand the importance of securing their long-term financial well-being is an investment that will yield significant benefits. How soon and for how long an individual saves is important because of the power of compound interest. For example, compare a person saving $100 a month starting at age 27 with a person saving the same amount starting at age 37. The first will have contributed just one-third more by age 67, but would accumulate twice as much in savings, assuming a 6% annual rate of return.

MarketWatch: The SEC itself has said that the whistleblower program is more successful than ever before. In its most recent annual report for the program the program's chief writes, In FY 2018 alone, the SEC awarded more than $168 million in whistleblower awards to 13 individuals whose information and cooperation assisted the Commission in bringing successful enforcement actions. This amount exceeds the total amount awarded in all prior years combined and reflects the significance of the information that whistleblowers are reporting to the Commission.

Buy the rumor, sell the news: This saying is more relevant to day traders than long-term investors.

The December ISM reading is the thin air of the high peaks, wrote Wells Fargo economists John Silvia and Tim Quinlan, in a note. It is quite uncommon for the ISM index to remain so firmly in expansion territory for such a long period.

When many more Americans relied primarily on traditional defined benefit pension programs for their postwork years, there was less need to consider the integration of alternative asset classes in defined-contribution plans. As more of us take greater responsibility for our own retirement outcomes, the investment industry must be more responsive to the need for these asset classes to be part of defined-contribution plans.

The U.S. dollar began to climb on Wednesday after Yellen said she expects Fed-controlled interest rates to rise a few times a year through 2019. She also said the central bank was nearing its goals for inflation and employment and that it makes sense to reduce the central bank's level of monetary support. Higher interest rates tend to dull demand for gold which doesn't bear a yield.

Divorce filings surge in January as people decide to start their New Year with a clean slate, helped by a stressful holiday period and, perhaps, even more stressful in-laws, experts say, with family lawyers reporting a rise of nearly one-third in business in the New Year. John Slowiaczek, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, says he typically sees a spike of 25% to 30% every year in January. Similar trends are seen in the U.K.: one in five couples plan to divorce after the holidays, according to one survey of 2,000 spouses by legal firm Irwin Mitchell.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was retreating sharply lower on Tuesday, with the blue-chip gauge on pace for its worst single-session decline in about 8 months. The Dow DJIA, -0.46% was off more than 350 points at its nadir, putting it on pace to suffer its steepest slide since May 17, 2017, according to FactSet data, when it fell 373 points or 1.8%. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% were also facing selling pressure, and threatening to mark the first back-to-back declines for those benchmarks in January. Moves lower come ahead of President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech later Tuesday and as investors await the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting. Rising yields have contributed to concerns as well, with the 10-year Treasury yield climbing above 2.72% for the first time in three years.
But Matthew Hornbach of Morgan Stanley said that outside of recessions, only one in four times when the Treasury Department unloaded a wave of supply did yields rise over recent history. Moreover, prices adjust much less on an outright basis when the actual supply hits the market than when expectations for an influx of supply started to build, he said. Forward-looking investors already had a strong inkling of upcoming bond issuance.
Medicare Part A coverage is commonly called Medicare hospital insurance. It covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, and some home health care services. You don't have to pay premiums for Part A coverage if you paid Medicare taxes for 40 or more quarters during your working years. In that case, you're considered to have paid your Part A premiums via Medicare taxes on wages and/or self-employment income. However, some individuals did not pay Medicare taxes for enough months while working and must pay for Part A coverage.
It's almost as predictable as May flowers following April showers: Whenever rates on fixed-rate mortgages go up, you'll see more borrowers opting for adjustable-rate mortgages. It happened in 2018 and it could continue into 2019.
In the past four decades these structures have grown in their political importance, size and scope. This applies to gerrymandering, as in the Republicans winning a 33-seat majority in the House of Representatives in 2012, with more than a million fewer votes than the Democrats. It applies to the Electoral College, with eight of the past 20 years under Republican presidents (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) who lost the popular vote; and to the Senate, where about half the U.S. population elects 80% of the Senate, while the other half gets 20%. And then there is voter suppression that targets minority and poorer voters, and disenfranchises them disproportionately.

Recently, he bought a $30 book.) I don't believe in 'disposable income.
The BOJ has for years been among the most accommodative central banks in the world and as recent as December reaffirmed its commitment to aggressive qualitative and quantitative-easing program, also known as QQE. With inflation stubbornly running below the BOJ's 2% annual target, the central bank has since early 2016 kept interest rates in negative territory and even introduced a 0%-target for its 10-year government bond yields to avoid deflation.
If this 70% tax bracket only applies to earned income, then it's only going to hit a very small slice of people who earn income above that level, said Daniel Bunn, director of global projects at the Tax Foundation.

While we don't know the full extent to which loan repayment policies will change, it's possible that everything from income-driven repayment to full on debt cancellation is in play. No matter the specific outcome, this new dynamic will allow for greater focus on emergency and long-term savings alongside retirement planning.
We entered 2020 on the brink of a trust crisis, as traditional institutions from mainstream media to the government became divisive sources and many flocked to social media circles to serve as their most relied upon source for financial guidance. In fact, during the prosperous decade that preceded 2020, the rise of crowdsourcing meant many of us not only used recommendations from strangers to decide where to eat or what movie to see, it also determined our biggest financial decisions.

While there are examples of rich people in the United States paying very low average tax rates, our system is — on the whole — average rate progressive, said Daniel Hemel, an assistant law professor specializing in taxation at the University of Chicago law school. Average rate progressive means that average tax rates rise with income.
Under current law, the 12.4% Social Security tax hits the first $137,700 of 2020 wages or net self-employment income. Employees pay 6.2% via withholding from paychecks, and employers pay the remaining 6.2%. Self-employed individuals pay the entire 12.4% out of their own pockets via the self-employment (SE) tax. For 2020, the 12.4% Social Security tax cuts out once 2020 wages or net SE income exceed the $137,700 ceiling. For 2021 and beyond, the Social Security tax ceiling will be adjusted annually to account for inflation. As things currently stand, the 2021 ceiling will rise to $142,800.
The Justice Department on Tuesday said it's filed an appeal against a case brought by the state of California, and is seeking a direct review in the U.S. Supreme Court, after a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It defies both law and common sense for DACA-an entirely discretionary non-enforcement policy that was implemented unilaterally by the last administration after Congress rejected similar legislative proposals and courts invalidated the similar DAPA policy-to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in San Francisco, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a statement.
In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.
Researchers at the Urban Institute looked at how often mortgage loans were prepaid in 2020 and compared it to past years — prepayments are a proxy for refinance activity. Their research found that falling interest rates alone didn't explain the surge in refinance activity, suggesting that appraisal waivers played a role.
This earnings season is likely going to be a bit of a reversal from the normal holiday-sales results, where consumer buying helped fuel a big finish to the year. This time, the cloud may take that starring role away, and the consumer companies that failed to draw in consumers are in danger of even more punishment on Wall Street.
Baime said his organization has heard from its member schools with great concern about students unable to complete their FAFSA due to the tax transcript issue. Unfortunately, this issue is likely affecting students who need the funds the most — college officials say they observe that low-income students are more likely to be flagged for verification. In some cases, colleges are working with students to allow them to start the semester in the absence of financing until the issues are resolved, Baime said.

There also aren't many medication take-back programs. Existing ones often don't accept controlled substances like opioids, and those that do aren't always frequent or convenient.
But we have a lot of accommodation in play. If real interest rates start to move up and if other things start to move up inflation may rise, he said.
Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.
In August, the Fed announced a new policy framework, saying that it will attempt to overshoot its 2% inflation target, after years of undershooting that target.
That means it may also have to restart quantitative easing, or asset purchases, that was so unpopular on Main Street and in Congress. This prospect causes some heartburn, so the central bank is casting around for new ideas.

The most prominent consumer tech company, Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% , already signaled that it will not boost revenue growth with its huge earnings warning earlier this month, when Apple said it expects a massive revenue shortfall of billions of dollars in its normally robust December quarter. Apple cited a big slowdown in China for the iPhone's slowing demand, due in part to the continuing trade war between the U.S. and China. It's also highly likely that Apple's high-end pricing model has hit a limit in China, where the average annual income was around $11,000 in 2017.

The Fed's murder weapon is aptly encapsulated in the pictorial representation of the yield curve, or term structure of interest rates. When the central bank raises its benchmark, short-term rate to a level that exceeds that on a risk-free, long-term rate, such as the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.625% — that is, when the term spread inverts — a recession is sure to follow, with an average lead time of 14 months.
• The European Union has granted emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. MRNA, -5.43% , MarketWatch's Jack Denton reported. The European Commission is expected to quickly grant authorization for the vaccine, allowing it to be deployed across Europe, where COVID-19 infections remain very high and millions of people continue to live under strict lockdown measures. The prospective clearance of the Moderna vaccine comes as governments across Europe face challenges in rolling out the vaccine at scale. In France, President Emmanuel Macron faces national criticism over the inoculation campaign, which lags its European peers.

Home prices are expected to deliver a good news, bad news year in 2019.
Simplified savings and investment programs like target-date funds make it easy for workers to contribute without having to actively manage their assets. Investors believe that by outsourcing the investment decision-making, they will get the best returns with the least risk. To truly accomplish this objective, though, maximizing that benefit requires better asset class diversification.
Big banks need to stop acting like loan sharks and start acting like responsible lenders.
The growth of home prices in China slowed in December from the month before, as a raft of property controls start to bite.

The debt limit continues to constrain Treasury's flexibility in financing and they urge Congress to raise the debt ceiling as soon as possible. Treasury continues to expect that they can fund the government through the end of January. The increases in coupon supply will eat into available borrowing authority and will further limit bill issuance until the debt ceiling is raised, said Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies, in a note.
Similarly, the yield on the 30-year bond TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.455% shed 2.6 basis points on the week to 2.976%, despite adding 2.2 basis points on Friday. The yield on the two-year note TMUBMUSD02Y, 0.157% declined 1.7 basis point to 1.173% this week, limited by a 1.7-basis point rise Friday.
14. Economics professor Teresa Ghilarducci and Blackstone Chief Operating Officer Hamilton James propose a new kind of guaranteed retirement account to deal with America's retirement savings shortfall. Our plan would provide a lifelong annuity, like a defined benefit plan, so no one would face the risk of outliving his or her money, they write. New York Times

MarketWatch: You asked the section 10A question, too, one of my favorite issues. The GAO prepared a report at the request of Congress in 2000 and 2003 to compile data on how often auditors reported illegal acts to the SEC.
But some employers are skeptical about the laws. In a survey of 108 businesses by executive search firm Korn Ferry, two-thirds said they thought the new laws would do little to change differences in pay, the Washington Post reported.
In California, the minimum wage went up 50 cents an hour starting Jan. 1, 2018 to $11 an hour. In some Bay Area and Silicon Valley cities where income inequality has soared, the minimum wage will shoot up to $15 an hour. Increases are also happening in Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, and, later this year, in New York City.

The ECB will meet in 10 days, and unless Mario Draghi finds a way to convince markets that the unwinding of stimulus will be very slow, I think the euro will be marching towards 1.25 by end of Q1, Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.
Rising yields can often be seen as a negative for gold, in part because the commodity offers no yield and because rising yields can contribute to a stronger dollar. But the currency has been under pressure as yields have edged higher, further boosting demand for gold. The ICE U.S. dollar index DXY, -0.03% , a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was off 0.3% at 89.07. A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive.
That's especially so in the face of event-driven investing and tactical asset allocation — two increasingly popular investment categories that boil down to focusing on what's working or poised to emerge.
To the extent you have capital losses this year or capital loss carryovers from earlier years, selling winners by year-end will not result in any tax hit. In particular, sheltering net short-term capital gains with capital losses is a tax-smart move because net short-terms gains will otherwise be taxed at your higher ordinary income rate of up to 37%, plus another 3.8% if the NIIT bites. Ouch.

But I really like buying credit in bear markets, and I also like buying converts. Go back and look at high-yield and convert mutual funds coming out of bear markets.
On a different note, even though I expect 2017 to be an up year for stocks, I think it may turn out to be more volatile overall, with bigger swings up and down. Trump is hell-bent on making many rapid and abrupt changes, which are likely to rock share prices. He is also the first president to use his Twitter TWTR, -4.96% account as a major policy tool.

Of course, if the economy evolves in a materially different fashion or if risks emerge, including those to financial stability, the Fed would be prepared to respond appropriately, the Cleveland Fed president said.
Banks like SocGen have been banging the table on this one, Lapthorne said in a phone interview, adding that he's personally had the subject on the radar for four years. His fresh warning came up in a recent presentation to clients given by he and the bank's uber-bearish strategist Albert Edwards. In a clutch of charts, they rolled out this one showing a huge ramp-up in debt for the small-cap focused Russell 2000 RUT, -1.72% :
As a result, the BLS cannot say for certain how many Uber drivers exist in the U.S. The BLS is missing a lot of these workers who don't think of themselves as having a primary job, Mathur said. And that's why people are telling them to ask more specific questions to understand what is considered non-traditional work.
An increase in wage growth, however, provided support for the argument that the employment market remains on a solid footing. Average hourly wages jumped 0.4% to $26 last month, while hourly pay increased 2.9% from December 2015 to December 2016, marking the fastest 12-month increase since a recovery that began in mid-2009.
If bitcoin breaks down from the current triangle, the downtrend will continue as the digital currency further erases its gains made during the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble, he wrote.
Further, the Fed should stop paying financial institutions interest to keep money out of the economy and parked at the Fed. Incredibly, the excess reserves of financial institutions that are sitting in the Federal Reserve has grown from less than $2 billion in 2008 to $2.4 trillion today. That is absurd.
MarketWatch: It's not just a PCAOB issue. It's also an SEC issue because it's reporting to the SEC. The SEC told the GAO it was going to start tracking those reports better and it doesn't seem to have done that yet.

8. New credits for homebuyers and renters
As of Saturday, COVID-19 had infected over 92.4 million people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, one of the major ways the virus has spread around the world so quickly, and killed over 2 million, including 394,413 in the U.S. The U.S. has the world's highest number of COVID-19 cases (23.7 million), followed by India (10.5 million), Brazil (8.4 million) and Russia (3.5 million), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.
New home sales ran at annual rate of 625,000 in December, 9.3% lower than November, but 14.1% higher than a year ago. The reading fell below the 680,000 forecast of economists polled by MarketWatch. Initial weekly jobless claims rose by 17,000 to 233,000 for the seven-day period ending Jan. 20.
The beginning of the year already appears to signal that authorities are dialing back on intervention, at least to support the currency. The yuan trading fix on Monday was set a full 100 basis points lower, putting it below 6.5 to the U.S. dollar USDCNY, +0.07% for the first time in more than four years.
A weaker yen would make sense given government bond yields of other developed nations are rising, the analysts added. Still, we would highlight that the yen remains very cheap from a long-term valuation perspective and [currency] markets continue to price in BOJ policy remaining very dovish for the foreseeable future. In that respect, there is risk that, if Mr. Kuroda's comments are seen as signaling a less dovish trajectory ahead, the yen could strengthen.
Millennials, the generation born between the early 1980s and the mid-to-late 1990s, make up about one-third of today's U.S. workforce. They are better educated than previous generations, with a greater proportion of them possessing a college degree. Because they have lived through the Great Recession, they are more risk averse. They are also more likely to begin to save earlier in their careers.
A sudden, sharp decline by the yuan this week appeared to have far-reaching consequences for global equity markets, as indexes from Asia to North America post serious losses.
The Federal Reserve seems intent on raising interest rates four times this year. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer reiterated that forecast Thursday, the same day the minutes from the Dec. 15-16 meeting were released, revealing policy makers' concern about the persistence of below-target inflation.
Employers of all sizes won't be allowed to ask job applicants about their salary history in California, and starting on July 1, 2018 in San Francisco, employers won't be allowed to give out salary information about current or former employees without written permission. Delaware enacted a similar law in December 2017, and New York City banned questions about pay history starting on Oct. 31, 2017.
Given that state governments are required to balance their budgets every year, they may be hard pressed to step up their higher education funding without some kind of incentive, Allison said. Still, the report notes that Ohio, Maryland and Missouri did manage to put the brakes on tuition growth of tuition fees during the period studied by the report.

At issue is the Antideficiency Act, which Bloomberg writes was enacted in the shadow of the Civil War after federal agencies flouted the Constitution's prohibition on drawing money from the Treasury without appropriations made by law. Charles Tiefer, a professor at the University of Baltimore law school, tells Bloomberg that some agencies are playing fast and loose with their ability to tap either past funds or incoming revenues to keep open. The piece notes no one has ever been charged with violating the Antideficiency Act.
It is not individual workers who are to blame for our retirement crisis. Nor is it their employers. It is the fault of a haphazard, ramshackle system.
None of the current teachers have ever had this type of opportunity where they learn how to do it all online, she said, that makes my generation of future teachers quite impressive because it means that we have this learned knowledge that other teachers don't have.
Leathern also encouraged Facebook users to report ads that violate the new policies.
The surprise announcement sent global bond markets into spin on Tuesday. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% jumped above 2.5% to its highest since March and the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, 2.432% logged its biggest one-day jump since Dec. 19.
We believe, based on what we saw and the timing of it, that the tension, the trade-war tension with the U.S. created this more-sharp downturn, he said.
Liberal members of Congress have complained recently about the lack of diversity among the Fed's top ranks.
On Thursday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he believes growth and interest rates will remain low in 2017, in part because any Trump-sponsored stimulus efforts likely won't arrive until 2018 or 2019.
When many more Americans relied primarily on traditional defined benefit pension programs for their postwork years, there was less need to consider the integration of alternative asset classes in defined-contribution plans. As more of us take greater responsibility for our own retirement outcomes, the investment industry must be more responsive to the need for these asset classes to be part of defined-contribution plans.
The state, which has seen a 23% increase in people moving to the state in the last five years, took the No. 1 spot for the first time, beating Oregon, which had been in the top place for the past three years. South Dakota also attracted those looking to live closer to family and retire, according to the 40th annual moving study by St. Louis-based moving company United Van Lines. The study based its findings on states' inbound and outbound percentages compared to total moves the company handles.
While there are examples of rich people in the United States paying very low average tax rates, our system is — on the whole — average rate progressive, said Daniel Hemel, an assistant law professor specializing in taxation at the University of Chicago law school. Average rate progressive means that average tax rates rise with income.
The last time GE disclosed any changes in reserves even partly attributable to the long-term-care reinsurance portfolio, according to Audit Analytics, was in its 2004 annual report, the same year it spun off the Genworth business. The company wrote that liabilities, reserves and annuity benefits were $4.5 billion higher than in 2003, and attributable to growth in annuities, long-term care insurance, structured settlements, the effects of the weaker U.S. dollar, increases in loss reserves for policies written in prior years and 2004 U.S. hurricane-related losses.
Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.
Lisette Partelow, senior director of K-12 strategic initiatives at CAP and the author of the analysis, said there are a variety of reasons why enrollment in teacher preparation programs may have declined. One factor: widely reported teacher layoffs in the wake of the Great Recession may have discouraged aspiring teachers from entering the field, Partelow said.
Just as Democrats should give up on the idea of a single-payer system based on confiscatory taxes on upper-income Americans, Republicans must wake up to the hard reality that competition in many health-care markets is rigged.
Lawrence Mishel, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute and former president of the left-leaning- pro-labor think tank, said it's important to avoid using broad definitions of gig workers that risk overstating the number of gig workers and their ability to impact the economy.
Countless studies show that investors tend to buy into a rising market only after much of the heat has played out, leaving them vulnerable when the market turns. Effectively, they buy high and sell low, whereas spreading a money into a diversified portfolio — and using additional deposits to keep allocations in line with the plan — tends to result in buying low, knowing that the strategy will eventually pay off.
It's things like these—higher prescription prices and the likelihood of reduced access to Medicare—that contribute to the scary number of $285,000. According to an annual estimate by Fidelity Investments, that's how much the average couple retiring at 65 will likely need for health care, over the rest of their lives, beyond what Medicare/Medicaid pay.
The market's reaction to May's remarks revived the notion that most of the strongest impulses affecting the Treasury market will be a consequence of other markets and even foreign geopolitical events, said Ian Lyngen and Aaron Kohli, fixed-income strategists at BMO Capital Markets, in a Tuesday research note.

The Biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. Families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. Apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.
However, some of the most prominent financial names reporting quarterly results Wednesday ended lower, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Investors believe that the recent rally in Asian equities would be unsustainable once Donald Trump assumes the U.S. presidency, said Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International.
Since 1980, the rule has been effect for a total of 20 years, with suspensions or repeals over stretches such as 1994-97 and 2001-02, according to the Congressional Research Service's records. The House was able to initiate legislation that automatically lifted the debt ceiling in 20 cases during those years. In 15 of those cases, the resolutions became law after getting passed by the Senate — which hasn't had a comparable rule — but in five instances, the resolutions didn't get enacted, so there wasn't a resulting increase to the debt limit.
But here in the U.S., officials at the CDC or the FDA have taken a different approach and decided not to issue such a warning. Because CDC has not identified a specific type of leafy greens linked to the U.S. infections, and because of the short shelf life of leafy greens, CDC is not recommending that U.S. residents avoid any particular food at this time, the agency said.
We're only looking for two hikes this year, said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities, with one being in the books since Wednesday.

But Connecticut created its own in the meantime and other states could be poised to do the same in their coming legislative sessions.
Meanwhile, equity risk premium has risen to levels not seen since 2016, thanks in part to a decline in yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.625% trading at 2.73% versus its 2018 peak of above 3%.

1.Every worker owns a portable retirement saving account. However long they work before retirement, employees maintain total control over a government guaranteed account. It is funded by a minimum 3% of the employee's salary—half contributed by the worker, half by the employer. A tax credit fully subsidizes the employee's share for all those earning under the median income and defrays the cost for everyone else. (We talk more about this later.)
Under the Fed's current targeting regime, the central bank doesn't do anything when inflation misses its target, simply uses the target to inform its discussion around policy.

But the EPI's analysis suggested bigger profits would likely not be redistributed among workers, but rather go into the pockets of owners. To truly help back-of-house, low-income workers, wages need to be increased and employers should not be allowed to take tips, she added. There is far more incentive for them to pocket that money than to give it to employees, she said.
Krawcheck eventually cut her Wall Street teeth at Salomon Brothers, briefly overlapping with Michael Lewis, who later described his tenure there in Liar's Poker. (In the book, Lewis describes scenes of misogyny and sexism at the firm; Krawcheck does the same in hers.)
Still, she said, the databases can serve as a starting point for consumers to compare baseline prices, which can vary widely. President Trump's goal with the public listings: They will ultimately help foster competition between hospitals and lower prices, whether through consumers comparison shopping or advocates comparing prices on patients' behalf.

Meanwhile, women control more than half of U.S. personal wealth — but an average woman's retirement account is just over half that of an average man's, according to BMO Wealth Institute, partly because women earn less during their lifetimes, accumulate more debt, live longer and suffer more financially after divorces.
Former Wall Street standout Krawcheck, who was vocal about the intersection of politics, money and culture throughout the presidential campaign — she told an interviewer before the election that Donald Trump's candidacy could be one of the best things that's ever happened for feminists — hasn't changed that tune in 2017.
Treasury prices pared modest gains Wednesday, leaving yields slightly lower, after minutes of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting highlighted some division over the central bank's forecast for three rate increases in 2018.

There's detailed data on the drop in enrollment in teacher preparation programs, but we don't have the other side of the equation, which is the demand side, Partelow said. In other words, it's hard to say whether the drop in supply in teachers is something to be really worried about or whether this is something that we can work with, she said.
Lenders must also be responsible in extending credit, including by considering a borrower's ability to repay a loan through an analysis of debt-to-future-expected income. For graduate and professional education this ability to repay requirement should guide both private lenders and the federal government.
Just the threat of inflation—germinating in a tightening labor market—was enough to prompt only the second U.S. interest-rate hike in a decade last month, as well as projections for gradual Federal Reserve rate tightening in 2017.
Despite ample evidence that anxiety is increasing during the pandemic, anxiety alone is rarely a driver for suicide. It is not even a risk factor for it, Ranney and Gold added. Right now it is all too easy to blame every tragedy on COVID-19. Science warns us, however, not to make this fundamental error of attribution.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has dramatically curtailed inspections of domestic food-processing facilities during the partial government shutdown, though it is now trying to resume work at the most high-risk sites.
Rosengren: Just having the data from the spring time roll off – we had the wireless prices changes, there were a couple other changes in prices that I think were tied to individual markets that really were not tied to overall inflation and so I think once we get to the spring time we're going to be seeing numbers much closer to 2%. In addition, we have pretty tight labor markets already, and if we continue to grow faster than potential, those labor markets are going to get even tighter. If we start seeing unemployment rates below 4%, that's a pretty tight labor market. You're already hearing lots of stories, I think, in some of the tight markets about the difficulty of getting labor and one way to respond to that is to offer higher wages to try to attract people either in the local market or from outside the local market. These things take time. They don't happen overnight. That's why there are long and variable lags in monetary policy. I do expect that over time it will have that impact. We'll see more wage pressures and we'll see with time more inflation.

Besides, financial conditions are a coincident, not a leading, indicator. They are loose until they tighten, which they do during downturns. The motivation for recession comes from the Fed, which pushes up the funds rate too far until it exceeds the yield on long-term rates, a phenomenon known as an inverted curve. That's a huge disincentive for banks, which typically borrow short and lend long.

The three-year trend has been clear, keeping in mind that diversified emerging-market ETFs and mutual funds have had relatively low holdings in China, because of the ban on foreigners holding Chinese A-shares, which was lifted in late 2014.

3. Markets will remain volatile, as investors are still wary of adverse economic developments and often overreact to same. It's best to have an investment policy that specifies, in advance, what will occur if the stock, bond, real estate or commodities markets (or any other asset class the investor possesses) goes up or down significantly in value. This disciplined approach to rebalancing an investment portfolio pays off.
Tuesday's dollar pullback was seen as a reversal from Monday's rally, which came on the coattails of the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% surging to its highest level since April 2014. Yields retreated early in the session on Tuesday, weighing on the buck, but the U.S. currency remained low even as Treasurys resumed their ascend. The 10-year note last yielded 2.71%, according to FactSet.

All of the factors of that equation carry strong negative risk:
If you wanted to become beneficiary of your husband's life insurance policy after he's gone, you would likely win the battle (the payout from the life insurance) but lose the war ($300,000 from your husband's estate). The divorce decree places the obligation on your husband to maintain the life insurance policy, says John Slowiaczek, president-elect at the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and an attorney based in Omaha, Neb., and even with you as the beneficiary on his policy, he would likely be in contempt of court. His children could make a claim of $300,000 against his estate, if he died with you as his beneficiary on that policy.
Analysts expect the ECB to pull back on its easy-money policies this year to play catch-up with the Federal Reserve, which has already increased interest rates five times since 2015. A hawkish ECB might provide a further fillip to the euro EURUSD, -0.03% in 2018.

This time around, there has been such intense focus on the curve, both instructive (Fed research on the powerful signal inherent in the term structure) and frivolous (market chatter that attaches some importance to a short-lived inversion between, say, 3- and 5-year notes), that the Fed may be more circumspect about tapping the brakes if the next adjustment in interest rates is certain to push the funds rate above the yield on the 10-year Treasury.

A statement like this can be very helpful in financially uncertain times, says Hockenbury: The purpose is to help you when you become anxious with big drops in the market. The last thing you want to do is to make poor investment decisions because of fear or greed.
Another factor: Because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly increased the standard deduction amounts for 2018-2025, fewer individuals will be itemizing. But having significant medical expenses (including those for Medicare health insurance premiums) may allow you to itemize and collect some tax savings.
But Monday's price actions is also not an absolute green light to buy Treasurys unless the repercussions of China's slowdown on the U.S. economy are corroborated by domestic data, said Anthony Valeri, investment strategist for LPL Financial.

 'Listing on a stock market creates pressures against creating employment; market participants seem to reward the lean and mean, and punish the job creators.'  — Professor Jerry Davis
China's currency devaluations are consistent with a broader trend among both emerging and advanced economies in recent years. Soon after the global financial crisis, the U.S. relied heavily on expansionary monetary policy, characterized by near-zero interest rates and large-scale asset purchases, which weakened the dollar BUXX, +0.34% , thereby boosting exports. More recently, the European Central Bank has adopted a similar approach, guiding the euro USDEUR, +0.54% downward in an effort to boost domestic activity.

A similar dynamic exists in college philanthropy. It's the best-resourced schools educating the most prepared — and in many cases, wealthiest — students who nab the bulk of donations to colleges. At the same time, community colleges and other regional schools doing the yeoman's work of educating America's students often struggle to raise funds.

• CVS Health Corp. CVS, -1.41% plans to give the first dose of COVID-19 vaccines in roughly 8,000 skilled-nursing facilities in 49 states by Jan. 25, MarketWatch's Jaimy Lee reported. The program allows both residents and employees of the facilities to get one of the two authorized COVID-19 vaccines right now; both groups are considered by the U.S. government to be at high risk of contracting the coronavirus. CVS said it also plans to publish its national and state vaccination figures every day at 4 p.m. It also said that while uptake among residents remains encouragingly high, the actual number of residents is about 20% to 30% lower than facility projections that were based on bed count. Initial uptake among staff is low, part of which is likely due to facilities wanting to stagger vaccinations between visits, said the drugstore chain.

The Republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country, and that would thereby vastly reduce their chances of holding national power.

In many cases, there is financial chaos among warring children when a parent dies without leaving a will, especially if one child has been quietly working their way into the parent's finances. Case in point: S. in Virginia wrote a letter to say she had discovered that her father had died without leaving a will and, even though he wanted to split his estate between his children, her father had accidentally made her sister an owner of his bank account, not just a signatory, meaning she owned the money in that bank account.

What does that mean? Here's the key distinction: Marginal tax rates are only applied to part of someone's income, not to all of their earnings.

Therein lies the issue at hand. When monetary policy tightens, it has an immediate negative influence on economic growth, while fiscal-policy improvements take a long time to work their way through the system. So although fiscal-policy improvements are necessary and attractive to the long-term health of the economy, the recent reaction of the stock market on expectations of some immediate positive influence is far too early.

That doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. Stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. And random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. But once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.

Inadequate savings is only one problem with relying on the stock market to fund our retirements. A far greater problem with relying on 401(k)s is that the stock market is extremely volatile.

The reasons why eligible students may be struggling to access SNAP are complex, but one major issue is the perception that college students don't qualify.

First-time buyers dominate most markets, and they tend to shop for homes priced below the median.

My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to cut it out and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to cut it out.

Indeed, the core structural problem is that the federal government writes blank checks for education programs regardless of whether the field of study is demanded or will yield a future income capable of allowing the student to repay his or her debt. In effect, the government does not conduct an ability to repay test. Even without new debt relief efforts, a recent study determined that under current policy the U.S. government (and accordingly the American taxpayer) should already expect to lose more than $400 billion in unpaid existing student loans.

We reported recently that Medicare reimbursement cuts of 1% to 10%, depending on the service, kicked in on New Year's Day. It's complicated, but essentially, here's the deal: states—virtually all are required to balance their budgets each year—have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and resulting recession. Given that Medicaid spending is usually a top—if not the top—source of spending, states can be expected to slash what they give to hospitals, physicians, nursing homes and other providers.

It is always possible that Trump will break the record and manage to engineer the longest economic expansion in history, surpassing 120 months. It is also possible that his policies misfire — such as starting a trade war with China — cutting the present economic expansion short. Trump will be the least predictable U.S. president in history, so we just don't know what might happen, but we have to be mindful of the statistical distribution of recessions listed in the table, below. Based on all the historical data, I think the probability of a recession during Trump's first term is close to 100%.

But if a will did exist, some state courts have ruled that life insurance contracts honor the divorce decree rather than the will. The takeaway? People should be clear about their wishes and put them down on paper, and not rely on the goodwill of others to do the right thing after they're gone.
Herrmann and Moec argued that half of the November decline in Germany was due to one-time factors, including the aftermath of a sharp drop in car production in the third quarter that appeared to reverberate through the supply chain in the final quarter of 2018. A slowdown in the chemical sector, due in part to cutbacks by BASF SE BAS, -0.83% as a result of low water levels on the Rhine, and a drop in pharmaceutical exports to Ireland after a sharp but difficult to explain run-up from late 2017 through October 2018, were the other factors that may have played a one-time role in the slowdown.

Rosengren: I think there are some advantages of having a Fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.

Investors ready to give up on diversification are surrendering that ability to capture the tendency of the market to rise over time, replacing it with a strategy that assumes they will always be able to identify what's working.

Powell says Fed is 'watching and waiting' on interest rates
At its most recent meeting in December, the median forecast by members of the central bank's interest-rate-setting committee predicted two more rate increases in 2019, but investors are predicting a more than 71.6% probability that the central bank stays pat this year, according to CME Group data, while Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan advocated for a pause in interest-rate increases during a Thursday-morning interview on Bloomberg Television.
Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, says that most people assume reducing the number of tax brackets is one way to simplify the U.S.'s extraordinarily complex tax code — which has been a rallying cry for politicians, particularly on the Republican side of the aisle.

Americans appear to be more divided over the more complex issue of immigration and, in particular, Trump's own immigration policies. More than half (52%) of U.S. adults said they disapproved of Trump's actions on immigration, according to another December poll released by PBS NewsHour, NPR and Marist. Some 44% of survey respondents said they approved of President Trump's stance and policies in relation to immigration, while 4% said they were unsure.
On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported on a new study, citing gig-economy experts who say economists have overestimated its impact on the U.S. economy. Alan Krueger of Princeton University and Lawrence Katz of Harvard sifted through new evidence to explain how, in a 2015 survey, they overestimated how people cobbling together a living from odd jobs, especially via apps like Uber, would upend traditional work arrangements, the paper said.
Social isolation is being recognized as equal to or greater than physical health problems such as obesity or heart conditions. Not going to work every day can make for quite a lonely existence.

One thing that's generally true is that folks that have income of $10 million or more, a lot of their income is what you would call unearned income: capital gains, or benefits from a business that you own or operate, and that may put you in a position where you're not necessarily taxed at what you might otherwise think based on the top marginal rate, he added.

4. Growth stocks are much more significantly overvalued at present, relative to value stocks. And large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks over about the last five years, as well. Given this, a long-term allocation of part of an investment portfolio to U.S. small cap value stocks makes sense. Emerging markets stocks are another area that appears to have lower values, relative to other stocks. While volatile, an allocation to emerging markets stocks for a small part of an investment portfolio could significantly add to returns over the long term (10 years or more), provided rebalancing of the portfolio occurs periodically.
There are three sources of people who can refuse to raise the debt limit — the president, the Senate and the House — and now one of them has been removed, Veuger told MarketWatch. What's more, the debt ceiling has been a big issue for the House, but it hasn't been a huge deal in the Senate over the past few years, he added. Even so, it is possible that the Senate or president could refuse to lift the debt limit, Veuger said.

6. On the regulatory front, the U.S. Department of Labor is close to finalizing regulations that will require all those providing advice to 401(k), certain other ERISA-covered retirement plan accounts, and all forms of IRAs, to do so under the fiduciary standard. But, the implementation date is likely to be at the end of 2016, not before. And the regulations won't apply to other types of accounts (such as individual non-IRA accounts, joint accounts, and trust accounts). Hence, investors need to protect themselves:

In fact, a diversified portfolio that includes alternative asset classes can still have 71% to 76% of its assets available to satisfy daily liquidity, according to the Center for Retirement Initiative's research.

This history of economic cycles implies concerns for 2018 and 2019. In 2017, we are likely to see a stock market rally. Stocks are likely to break out — hopefully without a dive first — as earnings growth for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% will resume after six quarters of flat-to-slightly-declining earnings. If earnings climb, stocks usually go up too, even though this situation is never a linear relationship.

If you wanted to become beneficiary of your husband's life insurance policy after he's gone, you would likely win the battle (the payout from the life insurance) but lose the war ($300,000 from your husband's estate). The divorce decree places the obligation on your husband to maintain the life insurance policy, says John Slowiaczek, president-elect at the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and an attorney based in Omaha, Neb., and even with you as the beneficiary on his policy, he would likely be in contempt of court. His children could make a claim of $300,000 against his estate, if he died with you as his beneficiary on that policy.

I'm glad that you finally realized that you cannot live her life for her. You deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future. That's nothing to feel guilty about. Plenty of children would have walked away. You didn't. This is something that your mother was either unable or unwilling to provide for you. In the face of remarkable odds, you provided it for yourself. And yet you are still thinking of others.
In some cases, the negative consequences of the proposed changes could depend on how they are enacted. With waivers, Trice expressed concerns that more privileged homeowners could have easier access. It's mostly white, wealthy people who get a waiver, and minority and the affordable housing sector don't get waivers, she said. This could lead to disparate impact, she argued, and could drive costs higher for the latter group if appraisers need to make up for lost business.
And yet a little light retouching can go a long way for some job seekers. Frown lines, dark circles under the eyes could give the impression of being tired or stressed out, experts say, so freshening up pictures can give you an extra edge on the competition.

The outlook: The current situation doesn't quite compare with the spring 2020 lockdowns, inasmuch as the end of the COVID-19 pandemic may be in sight: Vaccination campaigns have started throughout Europe, albeit at different speeds, but they should begin to make a significant impact once a sufficient number of people have been inoculated.

But these numbers are illusory. The U.S. has a national policy of overall inflation. The U.S. Federal Reserve has set an inflation objective of 2% in terms of the personal consumption expenditure deflator. This means that all prices should tend to go up by about 2% per year, or 22% per decade.
Rosengren: The [Fed forecasts] in December had three tightenings. I actually think we'll probably need a little bit more than that. I'm hopeful that we can continue to do it gradually. Doing it gradually probably requires us to continue to be doing it though. So if we were to slow down for some reason, I would be worried that at some point we would have to start moving more quickly. I would be worried about moving quickly at a time when asset prices were already at very high valuations. I think being able to do it more leisurely is one reason why we haven't had as much of a slowdown and probably has reduced the probability of having a recession. In addition, fiscal policy being so stimulative is a period where you wouldn't expect an economic downturn either.

My husband has concerns about me not acquiring her debt and/or expenses when the time comes and he feels it will destroy us financially. I don't disagree with him. I just struggle with doing right by everyone.

NEW YORK (Project Syndicate) — It's old news that large segments of society have become deeply unhappy with what they see as the establishment, especially the political class. The Yellow Vest protests in France, triggered by President Emmanuel Macron's move to hike fuel taxes in the name of combating climate change, are but the latest example of the scale of this alienation.

While the market has lately reacted negatively to any news that might encourage further rate hikes, Delwiche said, if the Fed is positioned to continue to raise rates in 2019 because the data warrants it, it's not such a scary thing for the stock market.
When taxes on the very wealthy are lowered, but raised for ordinary citizens to meet budgetary demands (whether from far-off Brussels or from well-off financiers), it should come as no surprise that some are angry. The Yellow Vests' refrain speaks to their concerns: The government talks about the end of the world. We are worried about the end of the month.
To the contrary, Friday's powerhouse of an employment report for December, with its 312,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, upward revisions to the previous two months, rising labor-force participation and the biggest increase in hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers since the Great Recession, was nothing if not encouraging for an expansion that will turn 10 in June.

The dollar index logged its best annual rise in three years, up 4.3% in 2018, a year marked by worries about global tariffs, softening international economic growth and a Federal Reserve apparently adamant about normalizing interest-rate policy, if now at a slower pace than imagined just a few months ago.

Much more spending will be necessary just to pull the economy back to the levels of employment and unemployment that we had before the COVID recession, and to help the millions who have been hurt by the pandemic. We still don't even know how much worse the pandemic itself will get before the effects of vaccination can seriously reduce infection rates.
Strength in the dollar, with the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.41% , a measure of the currency against six rival currencies, tacking on 0.7% Friday, weighed on gold, which is priced in the currency.

In his speech over the weekend to the AEA's annual conference in Atlanta, Blanchard argued that in the new-low-inflation environment, the real interest rate will remain lower than a countries growth rate.

Not everyone believes the pace of home prices will slow in 2019. One outlier is Fannie Mae, another government-sponsored enterprise. It forecasts that median prices for existing homes will go up 4.7% in 2019, compared with 4.5% in 2018. (The housing market is big, and Fannie Mae, NAR and other market participants don't always end up with the same estimates.)

They learned something from the Great Recession of 2008-09. They fought and reduced Democratic stimulus plans—which were not big enough to begin with—as much as possible. The end result was unemployment in October 2010 was still at 9.4%; and millions more jobs were lacking if we look at the decline in employment since the recession, rather than the unemployment stats only.

Nominal yields on the other hand have flatlined since early December, in a sign that investors believe that the Fed will continue to suppress yields even as inflation expectations normalise, said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research for ING in the Americas. Additional fiscal thrust to the economy could change that dynamic however.
Millennials have a lower level of financial literacy than older workers. Many of the most important financial decisions, including investing in higher education, saving for retirement, and purchasing a home, are made early in adult life. Addressing common budget challenges young workers might face such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and credit card debt, could help them save for retirement. For example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. While it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan. Providing opportunities to focus on the bigger picture of financial wellness can help workers better navigate these competing financial demands while encouraging planning and budgeting for unexpected expenses.
In his remarks about the economy and monetary policy, Powell stressed to uneasy financial markets that the central bank wasn't going to push interest rates higher or shrink the balance sheet regardless of the cost.

Tuesday's dollar pullback was seen as a reversal from Monday's rally, which came on the coattails of the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% surging to its highest level since April 2014. Yields retreated early in the session on Tuesday, weighing on the buck, but the U.S. currency remained low even as Treasurys resumed their ascend. The 10-year note last yielded 2.71%, according to FactSet.
Why there is still cause for concern
Some 28 U.S. states have so-called filial responsibility laws, which can be traced back to colonial times and (in theory) impose a duty on adult children to support their impoverished parents. Those states don't include New York. Here's a list of the other 28 that do have those laws, even if they don't practice them. One of those states is Pennsylvania, which did use filial responsibility to force an adult child to pay his mother's bill. In 2012, Pennsylvania court ruled that John Pittas must pay his mother's $93,000 nursing home bill after she moved to Greece. Otherwise, they are rarely enforced.
In addition to the inflation data, investors also looked ahead to the European Central Bank's first policy meeting of 2017, which will occur on Thursday and could shed some light on European monetary policy in a year likely to be driven by geopolitical events.

The first round of quarterly earnings every year is normally an exuberant time for tech companies, which get to show off how many devices they put under Christmas trees, how many ads for those goodies they sold, or services that will be enjoyed on the new iPhones, PCs and more. This earnings season, though, comes in the wake of a huge fourth-quarter decline for tech stocks, as forecasts for the holiday season sparked concerns about the death of huge growth rates that have propelled tech companies to previously outsize valuations — the most serious challenge the current tech boom has faced.

The reasons why eligible students may be struggling to access SNAP are complex, but one major issue is the perception that college students don't qualify. In 1980, the federal government restricted college-student access to SNAP as a way to prevent traditional students — those attending full-time and receiving financial support from their parents — from qualifying for the program because of their low income while in school.

7. A new research paper by Donald B. Keim, the John B. Neff Professor of Finance at The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and Olivia S. Mitchell, professor of insurance, risk management and business economics with Wharton's Policy Pension Research Council, takes a deep dive into an interesting case study in which a real retirement plan sponsor fundamentally reworked its investment menu. The research clearly shows the reformed menu promoted better decision-making by retirement plan participants, and researchers estimate it could lead to millions in savings for plan participants.

It's a difficult scenario: your child opens a new connected toy from grandma at Christmas, but you are not sure about its safety features. Brill said it's important to do research on the toy before allowing a child to use it, and be willing to get rid of the device if it doesn't offer proper protection. In rare cases he has even learned of toys being sent to children randomly in the mail under the guise of them winning a prize in order to hack into the family's network and obtain sensitive information. Never accept a toy, especially a connected one, from an unknown source.

How bad is the shortage? Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored enterprise that provides capital to the mortgage market, estimates that 370,000 fewer homes were built in 2017 than were needed to satisfy demand resulting from population growth. Until construction ramps up, housing costs will likely continue rising above income, constricting household formation and preventing homeownership for millions of potential households, Freddie Mac concludes.
For years, China's government sought to broaden equity ownership, thereby providing more Chinese citizens with a stake in a successful transition to a market economy. But, like the United States' effort to expand home ownership in the years preceding the 2008 crisis, Chinese policies went too far, creating a financially unsustainable situation that implied the possibility of major price declines and dislocations.
While rate-hike speculation has ramped up, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, who tends to be on the hawkish side of ECB policy, said imminent risk of a change is small for the moment, a Reuters report quoted him as saying in Germany late Friday. The ECB will next meet on Jan. 25.

In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.

In the last meeting headed by Chairwoman Janet Yellen, who will hand the reins to Jerome Powell on Feb. 3, the Fed signaled it is on track to raise rates at its next meeting in March after policy makers decided unanimously to leave the fed-funds rate unchanged in a range of 1.25% to 1.5%. The policy statement was read as relatively hawkish, asserting that inflation would pick up in coming months.

Before adjourning for the year, the House passed a measure that would increase the amount of stimulus checks Americans receive from $600 for an individual earning under $75,000 a year to $2,000. President Donald Trump also issued support for higher checks, but the enthusiasm failed to carry over into the Senate — and that's good news, according to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported on a new study, citing gig-economy experts who say economists have overestimated its impact on the U.S. economy. Alan Krueger of Princeton University and Lawrence Katz of Harvard sifted through new evidence to explain how, in a 2015 survey, they overestimated how people cobbling together a living from odd jobs, especially via apps like Uber, would upend traditional work arrangements, the paper said.
If you're wealthy, then you stand to benefit from Donald Trump's tax plan… right? That's the theme that most analyses of the president-elect's tax plan have focused on: The rich will pay less. But there are some higher-income Americans who may wind up paying more taxes under Trump than they have in past years.

Economists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. And there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. One would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. That means valuations, will, on average, be higher. So the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? And obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. So those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. But I would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.
I would have felt a lot better if the people that grew this enormous balance sheet were there when the unwinding process got going in earnest. This is because of a concern that Powell, then a Fed governor, voiced in 2012, which was on my mind throughout this whole quantitative-easing business. Powell was quoted by ZeroHedge last week (from the transcripts of the Oct. 23-24, 2012, FOMC meeting):

Most unhappy spouses wait until after the turkey has been carved and gifts have been unwrapped, she adds, regardless of how challenging the holidays have been.

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (Project Syndicate) — Speculative markets have always been vulnerable to illusion. But seeing the folly in markets provides no clear advantage in forecasting outcomes, because changes in the force of the illusion are difficult to predict.
While Wall Street received the largest taxpayer bailout in the history of the world with no strings attached, the American middle class continues to disappear, poverty is increasing and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider and wider.

Ever since the Great Recession, policy makers have been searching for easy ways to accelerate job growth. One answer that both Republicans and Democrats agreed on was encouraging the formation of new businesses by giving them access to capital through the stock market, under the assumption that new companies create most of the new jobs. And so the JOBS Act was passed, which makes it easier for new corporations to go public by selling shares to the public.

An examination of volatility, however, paints a much different picture. We found volatility in returns to the S&P 500 to be lower in restrictive monetary policy periods than in expansive monetary periods, as annualized volatility was 16.3% during expansive periods and only 14.4% during restrictive periods. Our research also shows that downside risk in equities was similar during expansive and restrictive periods. Specifically, investors had about a one-in-10 chance of experiencing a one-month loss of 4.5% or more in both expansive and restrictive conditions.

Based on Biden's comments, we can expect more stimulus spending by the federal government — possibly a lot more, which means an increase in the Federal Reserve's purchases of U.S. Treasury notes.

We could improve the public's understanding of our monetary policy reaction function if the statement provided more of a narrative of our assessment of how changes in economic and financial data have or have not changed the medium-run outlook, the risks around that outlook, and therefore, the appropriate policy path. In addition to the narrative, the statement would describe the current stance of policy and any policy actions taken, and some information on the future path of policy, she said.
I pay for her to have high-speed internet service at her home. I activated the service to be able to work from her house during a stretch of major medical issues where she needed someone to be with her. She now has a home health aide (government provided) three days a week and I have not found myself in that situation in over a year, but I still consider the Wi-Fi insurance, so I keep it. I also include her on my family cellphone plan. I bring her household items and groceries on every visit.
According to my analysis, however, bitcoin is forming another triangle pattern and is likely to make another big move once a breakout occurs, wrote Colombo. Bitcoin is still in a confirmed downtrend and a breakdown from this pattern would likely foreshadow the cryptocurrency hitting the low thousands or even under $1,000, eventually.
And, the reason these risky financial schemes were given such favorable ratings is simple. Wall Street paid for them.
It is always possible that Trump will break the record and manage to engineer the longest economic expansion in history, surpassing 120 months. It is also possible that his policies misfire — such as starting a trade war with China — cutting the present economic expansion short. Trump will be the least predictable U.S. president in history, so we just don't know what might happen, but we have to be mindful of the statistical distribution of recessions listed in the table, below. Based on all the historical data, I think the probability of a recession during Trump's first term is close to 100%.

Almost all of the Democratic candidates in the 2016 presidential election included some provision that would make tuition at public colleges free or debt-free. During the 2018 midterm campaign, more candidates — most prominently Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat from New York City — began talking openly about some form of debt forgiveness, an issue that didn't feature prominently in the mainstream 2016 campaign.

Notably, Americans in six states have been receiving less than the equivalent of the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage in unemployment benefits, without any form of enhanced benefits.
There are benefits to moving for a job, experts said. People who have the best career experiences are willing to relocate, said Chad Oakley, chief executive officer of global executive search firm Charles Aris in Greensboro, N.C, adding that individuals who relocate for work are likely to see a bigger jump in compensation than those who stay where they are.
The next time you hear someone say that the Fed has lost control of financial markets, please tell her long rates ain't misbehavin'. They're just doing their job.
The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was off 0.1% at 96.168 after surging as high as 96.60 following data that showed the U.S. added 312,000 new jobs in December, far exceeding the consensus forecast of 182,000 produced by a MarketWatch survey of economists. The unemployment rate rose to 3.9% from a 49-year low of 3.7% as the percentage of working-age Americans in the labor force climbed to a five-year high.
But it is more than the symbolism of the New Deal that is being invoked now. It is its animating purpose: putting people back to work, in the way that FDR did for the U.S., with its crushing unemployment of the time. Back then, that meant investments in rural electrification, roads, and dams.
Meanwhile, more economic data and Federal Reserve chatter could keep financial markets busy ahead of the U.S. presidential inauguration on Friday.
The head of the world's largest hedge fund agrees with Democratic-Socialist Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the need to address yawning income equality in the U.S., but he warned that her strategy of taxing the super-wealthy could have unintended consequences on the economy.
The price listed on the charge description master (CDM) represents the base price charged by the hospital for a health service, but it is rarely what a patient actually pays. Instead, patients should speak to their insurance company to find out the contracted rate the hospital charges the insurance carrier for the service and how much the patient needs to pay based on what has already been paid from their deductible.
This strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of Republican Party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the Democrats take office. And finally, there are also some true believers in high Republican places; Mitch McConnell used some of these in the Senate to tell Trump no can do just before the election, when Trump leaned on Republican senators to reach a deal with the Democrats on the Heroes 2.0 COVID stimulus bill. Trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with Senate Republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.

Inflation topping 2% in 2016, a level viewed as the Federal Reserve's target for a healthy economy, might compel the central bank to increase rates at a rapid clip, in turn encouraging selling in Treasury notes. Investors tend to unload government bonds in the face of expectations of higher rates because they can repurchase richer-yielding Treasury notes later.
French workers can just say non to emails from their boss when they're off the clock, thanks to a new law that took effect Sunday.
Questions on the FAFSA that require interactions with other agencies are also causing hiccups for some students and schools. In order to qualify for federal financial aid, male students need to register for the draft. The FAFSA typically performs a database match with the Selective Service Administration to make sure required students have registered, but right now that match is failing, Draeger said. Colleges are able to look students up individually to make sure they're registered, he said.

Appraisals have major stakes for home buyers and sellers alike. During a traditional appraisal, a licensed or certified appraiser visits a property that will be backed by a mortgage, collects data on the state of the home and then compares that data to other nearby properties. Lenders then use the appraised value to determine how much to lend to the prospective borrower.
As we go into 2019-2020, when most people predict the end of the rate hike cycle, we're forecasting 3.5%, whereas the market is priced for only 2%. We are generally ahead of the market as far as interest rates are concerned, he said.

It was a similar story in Europe, where the Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.40% rose 0.6%.
Another issue is that in China the overlap between corporates and the state can often make it difficult to get a true financial picture. For instance, hugely profitable state banks in recent years have by some estimates accounted for 50% of the net profits of all listed Chinese companies. This could mean if China's banks had to recognize a substantial increase in bad debts, another wild card is the impact on the central government's fiscal position through lost tax revenue.
Fed officials generally said that substantial progress was not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds.

Overall, Fed officials re-affirmed at this meeting that they anticipate raising interest rates three times in 2018, matching the tightening in 2017, but we still anticipate that a slightly faster than expected rebound in core inflation will mean we eventually see four rate hikes in 2018, said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in a Wednesday note following the release of minutes.

As employers have moved away from the simplicity and security of defined-benefit pension plans, employees have taken on more responsibility for retirement through defined contribution programs like 401(k) plans. With more workers taking a bigger role in their own financial futures, investment managers have sought to make the complicated decisions about asset allocation and risk management a bit simpler.

Now the crisis he had hoped to discuss at the conference has grown even more acute. Larson said he's worried that the challenges involved in operating school systems during the pandemic will only make it more difficult to find enough teachers to fill classrooms going forward. Some of his members have taken long-term leave during the pandemic. Others have used the opportunity to retire early because they're in a high-risk category.
The structure and governance of American corporations has utterly changed since the 1960s, when the largest companies by revenue were also among the largest employers and had large market capitalizations. For instance, in 1962, AT&T T, +0.12% had the biggest market cap and employed 564,000, while General Motors GM, +2.96% had the second-largest market cap and had 605,000 workers.
10. Boost retirement contributions — even if it's just by 1%. At the very least, contribute enough to secure your employer's match, which is typically between 3% and 6%, says Johannes. Try to boost contributions every six months or so if you can.
The FHFA is also exploring the value of appraisal waivers. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, federal regulators and housing authorities, along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have relaxed requirements for appraisals on certain loans. While most new loans backed by Fannie and Freddie during the COVID emergency featured traditional appraisals these flexibilities provide a way to protect the health and safety of industry participants, comply with local restrictions throughout the country, and continue to provide liquidity and stability to the market. One of the considerations the FHFA is exploring is whether to allow more permanent waivers for appraisals.
The underlying idea is to convince the market that the Fed won't be raising interest rates at the first sign of recovery, said Mark Gertler, economics professor at New York University.

Former President George H.W. Bush, 92, has been hospitalized.
Countless studies show that investors tend to buy into a rising market only after much of the heat has played out, leaving them vulnerable when the market turns. Effectively, they buy high and sell low, whereas spreading a money into a diversified portfolio — and using additional deposits to keep allocations in line with the plan — tends to result in buying low, knowing that the strategy will eventually pay off.

China on Monday announced its economy expanded by 6.6% over a year earlier, down from 2017's 6.9%. Growth in the three months ending in December cooled to 6.4% from the previous quarter's 6.5%. China's communist leaders are trying to steer China to slower, more self-sustaining growth based on consumer spending instead of trade and investment. But the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting Beijing to ease lending controls and step up government spending to shore up growth and avoid politically dangerous job losses. The lackluster data raised hopes for more policy action.
Still, Lesser, Gordon and Adams are hopeful the bill of rights will help Connecticut borrowers avoid being devastated by student debt and that it may inspire other states to better regulate the student loan industry.

The Moneyist: How to deal with a stingy friend
Economists generally think the next time the Fed could raise interest rates is in 10 weeks, at its March 15-16 meeting, as officials are widely expected to stand pat on policy when they meet at end of this month.
Atlanta Fed Chief Raphael Bostic, a nonvoting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, said the central bank should be patient about lifting rates given worries about tariffs and other signs of stress in the market.
For their part, policymakers should facilitate the compilation and publication of this type of data through dedicated research efforts.

A strain that Jha called a close cousin of the new variant has been found in South Africa and the U.K. but has not yet been detected in the U.S.
President Donald Trump fell into the same trap as his predecessors. He let Beijing lure him into three years of trade and investment negotiations instead of acting quickly with measures tough enough to disrupt the Chinese economy and force results.
Past years when stocks have gotten off to such a strong start have typically coincided with steep gains for the market overall. However, kicking January off with a rally hardly guarantees a smooth ride upward, and there may be no more dramatic illustration of this than 1987. While that year started with big gains, it was also the year of Black Monday, the Oct. 19 crash where 23% of market value was wiped out in a single session. However, the S&P still ended up 2% on the year in 1987.

To return to the refrain: sequencing and pacing matter.

In the past four decades these structures have grown in their political importance, size and scope. This applies to gerrymandering, as in the Republicans winning a 33-seat majority in the House of Representatives in 2012, with more than a million fewer votes than the Democrats. It applies to the Electoral College, with eight of the past 20 years under Republican presidents (George W. Bush and Donald Trump) who lost the popular vote; and to the Senate, where about half the U.S. population elects 80% of the Senate, while the other half gets 20%. And then there is voter suppression that targets minority and poorer voters, and disenfranchises them disproportionately.

Gold futures rose by nearly 3% on Monday to start the new year, after putting in the best annual return in a decade, with the move for bullion to its highest finish since November coming as the dollar sank to around a 2 1/2-year nadir.
Further weakness for the offshore and, more important, the onshore yuan seem inevitable, as well as desirable for the Chinese economy, he wrote. But challenging the market narrative that has seen investors and traders pile into the dollar since early November is enough to trigger a sharp cutback of [dollar] longs, not just in USD/CNH but across G-10 FX until liquidity conditions ease.
Its really dependent on what you see from the economy. I would like us to taper asset purchases next year but it really depends on the economy, she said.

There was nothing like a couple of limit-down, circuit-breaker-tripping trading days last week in China to seemingly send shock waves through global financial markets, making for the worst-ever start to a new year for U.S. equities. Or was there?
The situation is so challenging that even a banking regulator has struggled to figure it out. Bruce Adams, the general counsel for Connecticut's department of banking, recounted his exasperation in dealing with a servicer over his wife's student loans in a recent interview.

In April 2017, more than two million recorded messages from parents and children stored by CloudPets plush connected toy company were exposed to potential hackers, along with 800,000 emails and passwords. (CloudPets acknowledged the exposure, but said user information was not compromised.) In 2015, a hack of another toy company exposed the information of more than 200,000 children.

It's highly unlikely that you would be held responsible for your mother's debts when she passes on. Don't co-sign any loans and maintain a clear line between her finances and your own and keep an eye on your credit score, in the unlikely event that your mother would take out a loan in your name (especially if you shared the same first name). Unless you are a co-signer on a debt, you are in no way liable for your mother's debts, says Blake Harris, an attorney at Mile High Estate Planning in Denver. There isn't anything you need to do aside from continuing to follow your husband's wise financial advice.
Gold also moves inversely to the dollar. A cheaper greenback makes gold cheaper to buyers using other currencies and vice versa. Analysts said a prolonged stock market selloff could provide a lift for the metal, but jitters ahead of the conclusion of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting might have dented near-term enthusiasm.
Still, others advised caution on deaths of despair estimates.

For example, we estimate that if there had been no redistributive shifts since 1980, which mostly went in favor of shareholders, the level of the stock market in 2012 would have been only 56% of its observed value. However, these changes do not always favor shareholders. Case in point: the period from 1960 to 1980 saw substantial gains for workers at the expense of lower stock returns.
Structural reforms will be needed just to make the country into enough of a democracy so that we can actually vote for governments that might treat some of the pathologies that have been cultivated over the past few decades.
Borrowers applying for an income-driven repayment plan or re-certifying their income for an IDR plan should try to use the data retrieval tool, Kantrowitz said. If for some reason, they hit a snag — the tools don't always run perfectly, he noted — under normal circumstances a borrower would download their tax transcript from the IRS and file a paper application.
People bought the hope. Not just the rumor, but the hope, said Greg Anderson, global head of currency strategy at BMO Capital Markets. I think they'll be right on the fact, but in the mean time, you're holding a position that is very vulnerable to periodic cleanouts.
It is unacceptable that millions of Americans are paying credit card interest rates of 20 or 30 percent.
Evans said he didn't expect there was going to be an inflation surge right away because the relationship between low unemployment and inflation, seen in the Phillips curve, was flat.
Although the GAO found that some state SNAP agencies are working to help college students better understand their eligibility, the lack of information surrounding the topic means eligible students are struggling to access these benefits.

It used to be that the stock market was almost exclusively for the wealthy. Regular working folk didn't own stocks, but the destruction of defined-benefit pensions and the advent of do-it-yourself retirement savings changed all that. Now, although the top 1% still owns more than a third of all shares, and the top 10% owns more than 80%, about half of Americans own at least a few shares.

That's especially the case with people who are selling homes that are priced above the median for their local market, Realtor.com economist Hale says. First-time buyers dominate most markets, and they tend to shop for homes priced below the median. As a seller, Hale says, if you're in that above-median price point, you're going to have to price competitively and offer incentives for buyers.

5. Move your savings online, says Malani. Most savings accounts are paying out very low rates right now so you want to earn as much money as you can. That's why she likes online banks like Ally and Marcus. They pay a higher rate of interest on their regular savings account than a typical brick-and-mortar bank, she says.
Some market strategists said the hope that investors will soon hear more details about President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal plans was primarily responsible for Friday's rise.
Home price appreciation has slowed in 2018, says Frank Nothaft, chief economist for CoreLogic. Rising prices and interest rates have reduced home buyer activity and led to a gradual slowing in appreciation, he wrote in a market commentary.

1. Develop an investment policy statement, which is a document that outlines your investment goals and objectives and the strategies that you'll use to make them happen, says Mitchell C. Hockenbury, a certified financial planner at Kansas City-based 1440 Financial Partners. It might include information on your asset allocation, risk tolerance and more. He recommends taking Vanguard's Investor Questionnaire to help you develop the statement, or working with a professional on it.
Under price-level targeting, the Fed would commit to keeping the price level on a path defined by a 2% inflation rate, Bullard said. The hallmark of this approach is the Fed would commit to hitting the target over the medium term. The Fed would tolerate higher or lower inflation in the future to maintain the average inflation rate.
When merging tax brackets, there is no way for everybody to win and for there to not be losers, said tax attorney Mark Allison, of Caplin & Drysdale.
In a speech focused more on the broader economy than immediate interest-rate policy, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin told an audience in Raleigh, N.C., that the future growth of the labor force may depend on people currently on the sidelines. Barkin said opportunities to grow the workforce include policies to support women's labor force participation, workforce development and legal immigration. The former McKinsey consultant suggested that business underinvestment and declining startup rates were a reason for lagging productivity growth. He said he forecasts growth to be somewhat slower in 2019 than 2018.

These redistributive shifts, taken individually, are quite small, and are not major factors in explaining quarterly returns. But unlike movements in market confidence, which tend to return to normal over a few quarters or years, these redistributive shifts are virtually permanent, allowing a sequence of small shifts to build up over time — with huge overall impact.

That means it is more important than ever for Americans to comply with public safety measures experts have recommended throughout the pandemic, namely frequent hand washing, social distancing and wearing a face mask in all public spaces.

There is also the concern that Trump-inspired gains have factored in all the policy positives while ignoring the potential pitfalls that could accompany rising trade tensions with China and others.
In its second-quarter filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, GE wrote: We have recently experienced elevated claim experience for a portion of our long-term care insurance products, which may result in a deficiency in reserves plus future premiums compared to future benefit payments.

10. Other than keeping fees (and there are many hidden fees in investment products) and costs low, the next most important decision relates to strategic asset allocation—i.e., what is the target allocation to various asset classes (U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, fixed income investments, etc.) over the long term. Many retirees have investment portfolios that are either too aggressive or too conservative. And most risk tolerance questionnaires lack true insight into how much investment risk you NEED to take on, as opposed to how much risk you can tolerate. Developing a strategic asset allocation, as part of an overall investment policy, is an area that a fee-only, expert financial planner/investment adviser can help a retiree with.

Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion's share of the market's postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth.
Spano expects a choppy year with the S&P 500 reaching as high as 4,000 — a shiny round numbered object, as he calls it — but the index also falling to 3,000 or even lower.

This is not the first time a reader has suggested giving step-relatives the short shrift when it comes to inheritance. In November, Elsee in Vancouver, Wash., wrote to the Moneyologist to say that her late mother had effectively cut her step grandchildren out of her will before she died by transferring assets beyond the reach of probate, even though her mother's late husband wanted to divide his estate between Elsee and his grandchildren. In this case, she could have kept the lot. But I advised her to divide it.
While I still care for and provide for my mother, I learned the co-dependent relationship I had with her was unhealthy and I have scaled back significantly.

In general, financial analysts expect a mixed bag from tech this quarter that goes against what we would expect from the holiday season. The biggest growth is expected from companies focused on the corporate sector and internet advertising, while consumer-focused hardware could drag the overall results down. Those expectations show investors must break tech into different sectors, instead of trying to view it as a monolith that moves as one.

The question being posed anew is whether 2016 will be the year Beijing finally throws in the towel on its attempts to coerce multiple asset markets upwards, while its economy continues to sink in a sea of debt.
Still, it's possible that we've reached the logical limit of emergency monetary policy, and the European Central Bank is going to have to exit sometime in the near future.

The S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% saw double-digit gains from 2012 until 2014, primarily due to multiple (or price-to-earnings ratio) expansion—when investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings. The major reason behind the P/E expansion in 2012-2014 was the pumping of extraordinary liquidity in the form of Federal Reserve bond-buying program.
However, there is no guarantee employers would redistribute pooled tips, and critics say economic models show they will likely pocket them instead. If this proposed rule were finalized, restaurant owners could pocket between $523 million and $14.2 billion — with $5.8 billion being the best estimate — in tips earned by tipped workers each year, according to Economic Policy Institute economists Heidi Shierholz, David Cooper, Julia Wolfe, and Ben Zipperer.

China already has 10% daily limits up or down on individual stocks, which are regularly reached. Any circuit breakers should have taken into account the volatility in a market when some 90% of investors are retail and the market prohibits intraday trading.
While the bond market seems to expect inflation to rise, Mester said the economy's intrinsic dynamics suggest inflation is not going to move up quickly above 2%.

The likelihood of the former is low, Bethune said.
So now it's possible to have huge revenues and a large market capitalization without actually having many workers. Contrary to the idea that going public meant the creation of lots of new jobs, companies discovered that if anything, listing on a stock market creates pressures against creating employment; market participants seem to reward the lean and mean, and punish the job creators, Davis wrote.

Colombia's president, Ivan Duque, wrote that his country has full confidence in the solidity of the institutions of the United States of America, as well as in the values of respect for democracy and the rule of law shared by our countries.
And, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.
The country is at a critical juncture with respect to policy around higher education and its financing. One-time solutions such as loan forgiveness, while well-intentioned and desperately needed by many, do not alone solve underlying problems. We need to be honest and transparent with students, educators, and employers so that all can make informed decisions.
Many of the lowest-paid jobs in these areas are dominated by women.
Biden would also establish a new credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers.
Servicers also aren't providing borrowers with enough information about their best options for repayment, consumer advocates say. Federal student loan borrowers have a variety of protections and payment plans to choose from, which should make it nearly impossible for a borrower to default. And yet, one in four student loan borrowers is in default or struggling to repay their loan, according to the CFPB. Servicers may be in part to blame — as borrowers' main point of contact during the repayment process they're not doing enough to help borrowers find the repayment plans that are right for them, advocates say.
With control of the Senate in sight, Democratic lawmakers may now have scope to pass more aggressive fiscal measures that could weigh on the bond market through increased debt issuance and higher inflation expectations, according to analysts.
And the euphoria driving up cryptocurrencies and meltup of global stocks are both direct products of an ongoing, near-decade long monetary-policy experiment, he suggests in emailed comments.
But a recession? Not likely. For that to happen, the Fed would have to get to work raising interest rates and ignore the market's response, as it has in the past. The SEC requires mutual funds to tell investors that past performance is not a guarantee of future results. In the case of the Fed, let's hope it's not.
Benedict warned that the nearly 10% jump in the S&P 500 since Dec. 24 puts markets at fair value right now, and maybe a little high, a dynamic that could set stocks up for a fall in the event of bad news on the trade front or as earnings season begins.
2.Savings are pooled and invested to achieve higher returns. Workers select a guaranteed retirement account, or GRA, pension manager who invests in relatively high-return, well-diversified strategies. People can change managers annually. Pension managers have a fiduciary duty to GRA holders and pro- vide a layer of protection between them and Wall Street.
Like last year when major stock indices fell, this year it may be that you will stay in cash all year barely making a tiny positive return going forward. The best advice is to watch the smart money (those investors who are the first to identify undervalued sectors).

Energy's impact: A year ago, energy price deflation was subtracting 1 percentage point from the headline inflation rate tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Kenningham noted. Energy prices are no longer deflationary, but narrowing the inflation watch strictly to energy's impact can be shortsighted.
All three main equity benchmarks posted record gains on Friday to end the first week of 2018 on a stellar footing, marked by four straight positive session, following lackluster jobs data.
Almost two-thirds of minimum wage workers in the U.S. are women, according to the National Women's Law Center and, in 18 states, they're about to get raises. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour and hasn't increased since 2009. A woman with two children working full-time at that rate would live near or below the poverty line in nearly every state, according to a 2017 analysis by NWLC.

If you lived in California you are paying as much as 13% state income taxes; I was and a few years back I moved to first Texas and then Washington State and saved one-third of my income tax bill. You should do the same. All it takes to be a resident of an income-tax-fee state is to visit the state looking for a future home (your hotel bill is your proof). You owe it to yourself, your spouse and your family to at least consider the move.

But at these levels, even some of the biggest crypto skeptics argue the bounce has legs. Jeffrey Gundlach, the CEO of DoubleLine Capital, said on Tuesday a move to $5,000 is possible, adding it could be an easy 25%.

And I would put financial conditions – that is not a goal of monetary policy – but it makes it harder to start tightening if you have to do a lot of tightening, and if you really have to slow down the economy. If you think that potential GDP is growing around 1.75%, well if you want to get the unemployment rate to gradually go up, you are going to have to be seeing some 1.5% [GDP prints] and some lower numbers than we've been seeing. When we see those numbers it is possible that you get more of a slowdown than you're anticipating, and that can be particularly true, I think, if financial markets are a little bit too ebullient. So I think financial conditions and financial stability issues complement some of the concerns I would have about whether we're getting to an unsustainable level of unemployment rate over time.

These 'net-worth poor' households have no assets to withstand a sudden economic loss, like we have seen with COVID-19, she said. Even before the pandemic, many families with children were in a precarious situation. Things are not going to get better in the wake of COVID-19.
The pandemic and recession were associated with a 10% to 60% increase in deaths of despair above already high pre-pandemic levels, according to a working paper by Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago. These non-COVID excess deaths are disproportionately experienced by men aged 15-55, he found. Some health professionals, however, have said such estimates are both premature and overzealous in their projections.
What Trump's North Korea tweets mean
It's easy enough to argue why bond yields should rise. The Treasury Department will unload a deluge of issuance this year, major central banks are set to start a long-awaited shift away from easy money policies and inflation expectations have begun to trickle higher thanks to tight labor markets.
As for me, I continued to receive text updates about the flight I'd decided not to board to Paris, which finally left three days later — after more than 80 hours of delay. I saved all of my receipts and sent a detailed invoice of expenses incurred in my 24-hour airport saga to Norwegian.

Hopper says a gradual rise in mortgage rates won't cause most prospective buyers to give up on homeownership. On a $300,000 home, an increase of a quarter or a half percentage point is only going to impact the payment by between $75 and $100 a month, he says, which isn't insignificant, but it's not necessarily something that impacts the buying decision.
Inflation topping 2% in 2016, a level viewed as the Federal Reserve's target for a healthy economy, might compel the central bank to increase rates at a rapid clip, in turn encouraging selling in Treasury notes.

16. Plan for 2025. That's about the time we should have self-driving cars. And, as you get older, time proceeds faster (in your perception), which slows your reaction times. These and other factors tend to make driving skills decline over time. With self-driving cars will come far fewer accidents, and car ownership will change. More and more people will have shared cars (just call up a car, using an app), which should cut the cost of car ownership and use dramatically. And, it will aid many older retirees to maintain mobility. So, if you plan to purchase a car anytime soon, plan to keep it for 10 years, and realize that this might be the last car you purchase in your lifetime, as you will rent self-driving cars in the future.
Keep in mind that these are predictions about where mortgage rates will end this year and end next year. In between, mortgage rates can bounce up and down.

Treasury yields have been mostly climbing since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 8, a victory that has stirred hope that campaign promises touting fiscal stimulus, regulatory rollbacks and tax cuts, could be realized and rev up the domestic economy.

For employees whose companies are perhaps doing poorly and asking them to move away to a rural area, there could be consequences — if the job were not to work out, there might not be many other prospects, Oakley said.

Part Great Recession, part great reinvention
Investors say the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan will finally make their much awaited shift away from their ultra-accommodative stance this year. Market participants have pointed the finger at the two central banks for keeping a lid on long-dated Treasury yields, as low-to-negative interest rates spurred a flight of investors from debt of both countries into U.S. government paper.
Buy the dip, often abbreviated as BTD or BTFD (you can likely deduce what the F means): Half legitimate strategy, half jokey catchphrase, you'll often find this referenced on social media. The idea is to buy an asset when its price dips — provided you believe the price will rise again. That being said, trying to time the market might cost you.
Pullback (usually accompanied by words such as healthy, good, normal, etc.): Pullback is Wall Street jargon for a decline. Pairing it with a word such as healthy or normal is a way for investors to say a decline in a stock's price is just fine — it'll go up again soon enough.
There also aren't many medication take-back programs. Existing ones often don't accept controlled substances like opioids, and those that do aren't always frequent or convenient.
But there is no certainty that results will hearten the market, Colas cautions.
The shape of the dollar's pullback will give better indication of whether or not the long overdue technical correction is at hand. A move above $1.2440-$1.2460 might see the euro re-challenge its recent highs above $1.25 and probe into the band of technical objectives that extends from around $1.26 to $1.28, added currency strategists at Brown Brothers Harriman said in a note.
But overall, the tension between two major producers is adding to the unpredictability of oil prices, which slumped to multiyear lows in 2015 amid a supply glut. Expectations for more barrels coming on stream from Iran this year were a key factor in oil's tumble, after an international agreement over its nuclear program paved the way for an expected end this year to Western sanctions on buying its oil.

Instead, the driving force behind the session's stock-market gains and other financial-market moves appeared to be optimism over the prospect for another, larger round of aid spending following a Democratic sweep of a pair of runoff elections in Georgia that will give the party control of the Senate as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Jan. 20. Democrats retained control of the House in the Nov. 3 elections.

On Wednesday the Chinese government said the top trade envoys from both countries will meet at the end of January. The U.S. trade deficit with China grew to a record $323.3 billion in 2018. The two countries have raised taxes on billions of dollars of each other's goods in the spat over the trade deficit, Beijing's manufacturing plans, and U.S. complaints that China steals technology from foreign companies.

If, instead, the Fed persists is raising the funds rate to the point that it exceeds the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a recession would be the likely outcome. The average lead time for the term spread at business-cycle peaks — that is, the time between inversion and onset of recession — is 13.5-14 months, according to the Conference Board, the proprietor of the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, of which the term spread is first among equals.
But there may also be a broader explanation for continued disinvestment in higher education, which is that it's easy for policy makers to put funding for colleges and universities on the chopping block because constituents don't get as agitated by the cuts as they would about say, a tax increase, Allison said.
For long-term buy-and-hold investors, putting money in various asset classes — domestic and international, large and small companies, bonds, commodities, cash and more — tends to instill the peace of mind needed to stay the course through all conditions.
History shows past shutdowns have had a negligible impact on stocks. So far, that's been the case with the partial shutdown that began on Dec. 21 and entered its 26th day on Wednesday with no end in sight with congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump at an impasse over his demand for funding for a $5.3 billion border wall. The closure has far exceeded the prior record, a 21-day shutdown during the Clinton administration that began in December 1995.
If such a thorough study was the right way to proceed then, surely it would be appropriate today to provide a thorough, transparent analysis of what is potentially an even bigger issue. This could be of importance not only to the U.K. public, but also, arguably, to the development of policy thinking in Europe.
With long rates defying the Fed, policy makers really need to be patient because one more rate increase, all things equal, will invert the term spread.

Semiconductor stocks in general have officially entered downturn territory, said Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, in a note late last week. Many chip companies are seeing revenue slow, some of it due to tariffs on Chinese goods, or due to uncertainty because of the tariffs and the malaise in the global economy. This quarter, outlook will again be key for insight as to whether the current downturn will be swift or slow, but Rasgon said investors are now nervous that more cuts to estimates and spending loom ahead.

A 2011 paper Clayton was involved in drafting for the New York City Bar Association complains about the federal government's broad enforcement of that law.

The problem for policy makers is outflows are hard to control, as it let so much foreign capital in during the good times when the policy-driven yuan pegged to the greenback was a safe-haven. Last year Daiwa Research estimated the carry trade into China could be some $3 trillion. So far at least China's offshore bond markets have proved resilient despite equity falls, which would be an indicator of greater unease.
For years, China's government sought to broaden equity ownership, thereby providing more Chinese citizens with a stake in a successful transition to a market economy. But, like the United States' effort to expand home ownership in the years preceding the 2008 crisis, Chinese policies went too far, creating a financially unsustainable situation that implied the possibility of major price declines and dislocations.
It isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. We haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. I'm not advocating that. But I think it is an intentional policy. It is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.
On Wednesday, Trump offered little clarity on his economic stimulus plans, disappointing the market and sending the U.S. dollar down against major currencies.

Still, winning the Senate has its perks — Schumer would set the legislative agenda, hold committee hearings and exercise oversight of federal agencies.
In some ways the government's hands are tied from last year's stock buying as it now has a substantial position to protect. Added to this, the original reason the party could not let its bull market die remains due to the potential political fallout from losses after it effectively orchestrated the bubble.
It is because for the past five years in a row, the inflation target has been missed to the low side, and this has opened up a substantial gap between the actual and desired price level, Bullard said.
In fact, having a capital loss carryover could turn out to be a pretty good deal. The carryover can be used to shelter both short-term gains and long-term gains recognized next year and beyond. This can give you extra investing flexibility in those years, because you won't have to hold appreciated securities for over a year to get a lower tax rate. You'll pay 0% to the extent you can shelter gains with your loss carryover. If there are future tax rate increases (which I think are unlikely through at least 2022), capital loss carryovers into future years could turn out to be really valuable.

In that respect, there is risk that, if Mr. Kuroda's comments are seen as signaling a less dovish trajectory ahead, the yen could strengthen.
A gargantuan surge in new jobs in December, a recent lull in inflation and a more cautious Federal Reserve have dispelled fears that the U.S. faces a looming recession.

S&P Global Ratings raised Greece's credit rating by one rung to B from B- on Friday, marking the first time S&P has upgraded the country's sovereign debt in two years. The outlook was kept positive, which implies another upgrade is likely. The sovereign bond rating is still 5 notches below investment grade. Greece's growth and fiscal outlooks have improved alongside a labor market recovery and amid a period of relative policy certainty, S&P said. Investor reaction to the announcement is likely to show up later next week as European markets were closed before the report.

While reconciliation could be powerful tool — especially if Democrats use it twice in one year, as Republicans did in 2017 — the narrow margins in both chambers mean leaders will have to thread the needle in writing bills. Repealing some of the 2017 tax cuts would meet the rules and have broad Democratic support, for example, while the Green New Deal would likely have a tougher time on both counts.
Powell used all the right buzzwords and phrases to calm markets on Friday. He said (I'm consolidating here) that there is no preset path for policy; that, given muted inflation, the Fed can be patient and see how the economy evolves; that we are listening to the markets and are always prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly to promote our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices.

Shares in Asia rose modestly on Monday, extending gains on Wall Street last week. Buying enthusiasm was spurred by renewed hopes for progress on resolving the trade standoff between the U.S. and China. Shares rose in Shanghai and Hong Kong early Monday despite news that China's economy grew at its lowest pace in three decades last year.
Rosengren: No, I wouldn't phrase it that way. Our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. The unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. My own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. If you look at the Blue Chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. So we are actually moving in the opposite direction. I do think that we have to gradually tighten and I don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.
We get a lot of women in at the entry-level positions.

One of the biggest changes in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the installation of a flat 21% corporate federal income tax rate for 2018 and beyond. Before the TCJA, the maximum effective rate for profitable corporations was 35%. The Biden plan would increase the corporate tax rate to 28%. This change would raise an estimated $1.1 trillion or so over 10 years.
The Fed's stance contrasts with central banks elsewhere, including the ECB.
The Biden plan would impose a new 15% minimum tax on corporations with at least $100 million in annual income that pay little or no federal income tax under the regular rules. An affected corporation would pay the greater of: (1) the regular federal income tax bill or (2) 15% of reported book net income. This new tax would raise an estimated $160 billion to $320 billion over 10 years.

The other factors are skill, permanence of the working relationship and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production.

CVS said it also plans to publish its national and state vaccination figures every day at 4 p.m. It also said that while uptake among residents remains encouragingly high, the actual number of residents is about 20% to 30% lower than facility projections that were based on bed count. Initial uptake among staff is low, part of which is likely due to facilities wanting to stagger vaccinations between visits, said the drugstore chain.

In my view, it is unacceptable that the Federal Reserve has been hijacked by the very bankers it is in charge of regulating. I think the American people would be shocked to learn that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, served on the board of the New York Fed at the same time that his bank received a $391 billion bailout from the Federal Reserve. That is a clear conflict of interest that I would ban as president. When I am elected, the foxes will no longer be guarding the henhouse at the Fed. Under my administration, banking industry executives will no longer be allowed to serve on the Fed's boards and handpick its members and staff.

After the price of oil bottoms out, I would expect to see headline inflation move significantly higher, Lacker said in a speech to the Chamber of Commerce in Raleigh, N.C. Most Fed officials, including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen have been more cautious, saying that inflation will move higher over a more loosely-defined medium term. Lacker is a hawk on the Fed's interest rate committee, having dissented at the Fed's September and October meetings in favor of an increase in interest rates. He is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year.

In California, the minimum wage went up 50 cents an hour starting Jan. 1, 2018 to $11 an hour. In some Bay Area and Silicon Valley cities where income inequality has soared, the minimum wage will shoot up to $15 an hour.

But there are signs the Trump trade is losing some of its mojo.
The economists argue that a tight labor market, a slightly looser fiscal stance by Germany's government, a pickup in nominal wage growth and a very tight labor market could ensure that a technical recession doesn't turn into a downturn proper.
As we head into 2021, it's time to look ahead for how we can take what we've learned from the past 12 months — and further back — and sort out the trends that will be most advantageous.
It may be that divorce is not the best option, particularly if one partner doesn't have company health insurance. Annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage reached $18,142 this year, up 3% on last year, with workers on average paying $5,277 towards their coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Menlo, Calif. Premiums for Obamacare, which president-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal, are expected to rise 22% next year for the benchmark silver plan. Some health insurers won't insure both parties on the same policy if the couple has legally separated, Slowiaczek says.
Former Wall Street standout Krawcheck, who was vocal about the intersection of politics, money and culture throughout the presidential campaign — she told an interviewer before the election that Donald Trump's candidacy could be one of the best things that's ever happened for feminists — hasn't changed that tune in 2017.

Trump has said that extending existing border barriers is needed to curb illegal immigration along the southern border and he used Saturday's address to stress immigrant-linked crime accusations, statistics that data agencies have refuted. Trump asked for $800 million each for humanitarian care at the border, which he said targets children and vulnerable travelers brought over to help the status of other adults crossing alongside the minors and $805 million for drug trafficking prevention efforts.
Nominal yields on the other hand have flatlined since early December, in a sign that investors believe that the Fed will continue to suppress yields even as inflation expectations normalise, said Padhraic Garvey, regional head of research for ING in the Americas. Additional fiscal thrust to the economy could change that dynamic however.

The rally seen in stocks over 2017 has led to a surge in bullish sentiment, which some analysts have cautioned could represent a contrary warning signal, though others have said optimism market hasn't yet reached the level of euphoria, a stage that is considered a killer of bull markets.
In many cases, there is financial chaos among warring children when a parent dies without leaving a will, especially if one child has been quietly working their way into the parent's finances. Case in point: S. in Virginia wrote a letter to say she had discovered that her father had died without leaving a will and, even though he wanted to split his estate between his children, her father had accidentally made her sister an owner of his bank account, not just a signatory, meaning she owned the money in that bank account. Nice work, if you can get it.
Researchers at the Urban Institute looked at how often mortgage loans were prepaid in 2020 and compared it to past years — prepayments are a proxy for refinance activity. Their research found that falling interest rates alone didn't explain the surge in refinance activity, suggesting that appraisal waivers played a role.

When bacterial contamination stems from something highly perishable like romaine lettuce, outbreaks are usually more short-lived, said Bill Marler, an attorney who represents victims in cases involving food safety. The illnesses extend over a month, and that's unusual, he said. Normally when you see an outbreak with a perishable product, you'll see an outbreak over a week.

In 2008, the taxpayers of this country bailed out Wall Street because we were told they were too big to fail. Yet, today, 3 out of the 4 largest financial institutions (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo) are nearly 80 percent bigger than before we bailed them out. Incredibly, the six largest banks in this country issue more than two-thirds of all credit cards and more than 35 percent of all mortgages. They control more than 95 percent of all financial derivatives and hold more than 40 percent of all bank deposits. Their assets are equivalent to nearly 60 percent of our GDP. Enough is enough.
Sales at U.S. retailers in December fell short of economists' lofty expectations, which Ripley said suggested that U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter.
Expectations that the president-elect's administration will follow through on pledges to slash regulation, cut corporate taxes and boost infrastructure spending have contributed to the Trump trade, boosting stocks and triggering a sharp rotation into sectors expected to draw outsize benefit from those policies. Government bonds, like the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.711% , sold off sharply on expectations for bigger deficits, stronger growth and higher inflation.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. energy sector will see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings this year given the outlook for continued low oil prices, said Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan on Monday. The overall tone in the oil and gas sector has soured, as expectations have decidedly shifted to an 'even lower for even longer' price outlook in the wake of the December OPEC meeting, Kaplan said in a speech in Dallas. Economists at the Dallas Fed forecast that global excess inventories aren't likely to begin falling until 2017, and there is a risk that it will take longer, he said. Given the various cross-currents, the ultimate timing of reaching market production/consumption balance remains uncertain, he added. Kaplan is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year. He said he was in favor of the December interest-rate increase, the first since 2006.
The Producer Price Index showed wholesale prices increased by 1.6% in 2016, roughly in line with economists' expectations. Wholesale prices are an early indicator of consumer-price growth because companies typically mark up the prices of goods on their shelves to offset the higher prices paid to distributors. Much of the increase was attributed to rising energy costs.
And the opposite seems to be true too. If you were tall throughout most of high school (as many tall people were) you were even more likely to participate in the stock market as an adult. Addoum says that those who were tall in high school tended to have higher self-esteem in high school.
We've clawed back from the December downturn, which was disconnected from economic reality, he said. With inflation not rising convincingly above 2%, markets are right to think that the Fed will be their friend, he said, adding that Friday's subdued inflation reading will give the central bank even more reason to take the patient approach Powell has outlined in recent speeches.
In Manatee County, Fla., Pat Barber, the president of the local teacher's union, said she's worried the pandemic will only exacerbate a squeeze on the supply of teachers.

A Federal Reserve that was viewed as being overly ambitious in its attempt to normalize rates from crisis-era policy also was seen as a point of friction for investors, perhaps, amplified by dread that the U.S.-China trade spat would help to further gum up global economic expansion.
The stock market could not have written a more perfect script.

You can also try the free app Earnin, which allows you to borrow up to $100 from your pending paycheck rather than have to wait every two weeks and risk overdraft. The app allows you to pay what you think is fair for the service. Just beware of the potential pitfalls, including blowing your budget and overspending.
It detracts from the intrinsic motivation, that a donor may have for giving, he said. It's easy to imagine some recipients thinking I was all geared up to help kids with financial aid and help advance science and here you are talking about what's in it for you, he said. For some people that's going to be a turn off.
If such a thorough study was the right way to proceed then, surely it would be appropriate today to provide a thorough, transparent analysis of what is potentially an even bigger issue. This could be of importance not only to the U.K. public, but also, arguably, to the development of policy thinking in Europe.

Back in 2017, the gulf between the Fed and Wall Street over the appropriate level of interest rates seemed impossible to close. Analysts accused the central bank of risking a policy misstep if it hiked rates when inflation readings persisted below its 2% target. Policymakers including Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen stuck to the script that a lack of price pressures would prove fleeting.

Spoofing is when traders place large bids or offers in the futures market with the intent to cancel before execution after another smaller bid or offer is placed on the opposite side of the same market. The purpose of the scheme is to create the false appearance of market depth, which in turn creates the impression of greater buying or selling interest than legitimately exists.
A group of produce industry associations pushed back against such calls given the lack of CDC confirmation regarding the cause of the outbreak and how perishable lettuce is.

The CFTC said in its complaint that Deutsche Bank did maintain systems and policies designed to detect and deter spoofing but had failed to perform its supervisory duties diligently. Deutsche Bank put in place an electronic surveillance system to monitor trading patterns in order to detect potential spoofing in precious metals futures contracts by its traders, and the system did detect several hundred instances of potential spoofing by its traders, including several of the ones cited in the complaint. However, the regulator said it did not follow up on the majority of potential instances of misconduct identified by its electronic surveillance system.

The total value of the U.S. housing stock grew to a record $29.6 trillion in 2016, an increase of nearly 6% and $1.6 trillion over the previous year, according to an analysis of the 35 largest metro areas by real-estate website Zillow. Portland, Ore., had the biggest increase in value among the largest housing markets, growing more than 13% in 2016, followed by Seattle (up 12.7%) and Dallas (up 11%). Los Angeles is the most valuable metro area, worth a cumulative $2.5 trillion. The U.S. housing market has regained all the value lost during the housing crisis, Zillow found. The cumulative value of all homes in the U.S. declined by $6.4 trillion between 2006 and 2012.
Mester said substantial progress might not be reached even with a second-half economic recovery.
Even as the economy recovers, states' level of funding for their higher education institutions hasn't bounced back, the report found. The reasons for the cutbacks (or in two cases, the growth) in spending on colleges and universities vary based on state budget constraints, revenues and other factors. For example, it's likely North Dakota and Alaska were able to boost their higher education spending in part thanks to increased oil revenues, a resource not available in every state, said Tom Allison, the report's author.

On Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell again stressed that the central bank is flexible and patient and can change policy on a dime if the economic outlook worsens. He also said the forecast of two interest-rate increases in 2019 was conditional on a very strong outlook for 2019.
It is said that the stock market SPX, -0.16% is not the economy, and that's true. But the stock market does convey certain information and expectations about things that affect the economy, and are affected by it, such as corporate earnings. And those profit expectations have been tempered after the spectacular, double-digit gains in 2018. (Year-over-year comparisons become more challenging next year.)

This is of course vitally important when the economy is still down more than 9 million jobs since February. We have an estimated 26 million people who are going hungry in the United States, and some 7 million to 14 million at risk of eviction. And many of the jobs lost in the hardest-hit industries, such as retail and hospitality, will not be coming back. Many workers will have to change occupations and some will be unemployed long-term; at present, the percent of unemployed who are long-term (more than six months out of work) is at 36.9%, up from 19.2% in February.

Consequently, Marler suggested that people toss the romaine lettuce sitting in their fridges for the time being. Consumer Reports similarly advised that people avoid romaine lettuce until public health officials provide more information. Both Marler and Consumer Reports argued that the abundance of caution was warranted because romaine lettuce is nearly always consumed raw and washing alone isn't guaranteed to rid the produce of the bacteria.

Other countries have had to do this — Australia and New Zealand, for example, when in the 1970s the U.K. progressively scaled back its food imports from them under pressure from the European Economic Community.

The kicker missed a late 43-yard field goal that would have won Sunday's wild-card-round game against the Philadelphia Eagles, ending his overachieving team's bid to advance in the playoffs and toward its first Super Bowl appearance since 2007. The missed field goal has already been called among [the] most brutal in NFL playoff history. The kick looked like a winner until its leftward drift resulted in its hitting the upright, then the crossbar, drawing gasps from the crowd.
Industrial production data was a proper disappointment this month. Our German GDP tracker has deteriorated to minus 0.1% [quarter-on-quarter]. This would be the second consecutive [quarter-on-quarter] GDP contraction, meaning Germany could now be in a technical recession, wrote economists Evelyn Herrmann and Gilles Moec at Bank of American Merrill Lynch, in a Monday note (see chart below).

There will need to be a significant increase in core inflation and wages before the ECB would consider a further, faster or earlier reduction of QE, said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist, at ING in a note. In our view, even a hint at 2018 tapering will not come before the summer, after the Dutch and French elections and the first possible impact of new U.S. economic policies.
Powell's remarks suggested to some that the Fed may hike rates at a more measured pace, news that may provide long-term support for gold which tends to see weakened investment appetite when interest rates are competitively richer. Gold doesn't offer a yield.
The euro has been bolstered on two fronts against the dollar, firstly by last week's minutes from the European Central Bank's December meeting suggesting a potential hawkish shift in policy. Further support from the single currency has come from news that German lawmakers are getting closer to agreeing on a governing coalition.
Germany's slowdown is attributable in part to slowing activity in China, the economists said. And concerns about China are certainly on the rise thanks to homegrown headwinds and the continued trade battle with the U.S. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% were feeling modest pressure Monday after a round of weaker-than-expected trade data out of the country.
Changes to the appraisal process could save Americans time and money
On Thursday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he believes growth and interest rates will remain low in 2017, in part because any Trump-sponsored stimulus efforts likely won't arrive until 2018 or 2019.

Treasury prices came under selling pressure Wednesday, pushing yields to their highest level in weeks, as U.S. economic reports delivered signs of rising inflation.
You can't sit on the sidelines as the Trump rally continues, but you have good reason to question its durability, wrote analysts at Montreal-based Pavilion, in a Monday note. The president-elect's tax plan will do little to boost growth, and will largely benefit high earners, crimping consumption and dramatically eroding fiscal balances.
Changes like; a marriage, birth of a child, death of a family member, a change in health status, divorce, change of jobs, caring for a special needs child, entering retirement, charitable giving decisions, selling of a primary residence or investment property.

Krawcheck, now 52, was fired from Citigroup in September 2008 over an argument with then-CEO Vikram Pandit in which she felt the company should compensate clients who lost money after following the bank's investment advice.
Warning: The state and local tax prepayment drill can be a bad idea if you will owe the alternative minimum tax (AMT) for this year. That's because write-offs for state and local income and property taxes are completely disallowed under the AMT rules. Therefore, prepaying those expenses may do little or no tax-saving good if you will be in the AMT zone. Thankfully, changes included in the TCJA took millions of taxpayers out of AMT danger, but not everybody. Ask your tax adviser if you're in the clear for this year or not.
We need a banking system that is part of the productive economy – making loans at affordable rates to small- and medium-sized businesses so that we create decent-paying jobs. Wall Street cannot continue to be an island unto itself, gambling trillions in risky financial instruments, making huge profits and assured that, if their schemes fail, the taxpayers will be there to bail them out.
Of course, while Monday's moves may be dramatic, there is plenty for investors to trade on in the days, weeks and months ahead. This week's overall performance, in fact, might still very well be dictated by the reaction to the December U.S. jobs report on Friday. After all, investors will undoubtedly still be reading the data for clues as to the timing and pace of future Fed interest-rate increases as the U.S. central bank tries to normalize monetary policy in 2016.
Meanwhile, the modest drop in Japanese stocks — which includes exporters like Canon Inc. 7751, +0.40% dropping 0.4% and Toyota Motor Co. 7203, +4.12% declining 0.8% — comes as the yen has rebounded 0.6% against the dollar, which was lower versus most Asian currencies early Thursday following overnight weakness in the greenback.

In the wake of Donald Trump's election, many are looking to the stock market to learn what is in store for the economy. While much of the short-run action likely reflects movements in market confidence or uncertainty, upcoming decisions on corporate taxes or labor policy may influence what shareholders ultimately receive. Our research implies that expectations regarding redistribution, rather than forecasts of overall economic performance, may play a crucial role in driving stock prices as the political agenda is revealed.
At Treasury, Janet Yellen, a labor economist who proved uninventive at the Fed, will reflexively support free trade and emphasize Keynesian solutions when our problems are more industrial-strategic and structural. At Defense, Gen. Lloyd Austin offers great experience fighting land wars in the Middle East, but the paramount security challenges are cyber and naval in the Pacific.
Let me help shatter that myth today.
In a speech focused more on the broader economy than immediate interest-rate policy, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin told an audience in Raleigh, N.C., that the future growth of the labor force may depend on people currently on the sidelines. Barkin said opportunities to grow the workforce include policies to support women's labor force participation, workforce development and legal immigration. The former McKinsey consultant suggested that business underinvestment and declining startup rates were a reason for lagging productivity growth. He said he forecasts growth to be somewhat slower in 2019 than 2018.

Given these shifting priorities, it is hardly a stretch to conclude that it would be politically difficult for Beijing to keep extending unlimited funds to bail out equity investors.
At the ECB's last meeting, the central bank extended its bond-buying program by nine months, although it reduced the pace of its purchases beyond March.

We are seeing upward pressure on wage growth, upward pressure on core inflation. We expect further monetary policy normalization from the Federal Reserve to a degree that goes beyond what is priced into the bond market, Goldman's chief economist said.
The S&P 500 index helped in this regard last year by splitting some large tech companies away from the sector largely referred to as tech, to show the differences between the companies. The interactive media sector — which was created last year and comprises Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +1.26% GOOGL, +1.43% , Facebook Inc. FB, +2.02% , Twitter Inc. TWTR, -1.47% and TripAdvisor Inc. TRIP, -3.66% — saw revenue soar 25.8% and earnings surge 42% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Wall Street still expects massive sales growth to continue in fourth-quarter results this year, with revenue expected to increase 46.4%, but earnings are only expected to grow 8.5%, dragged down by Facebook's hefty spending on combating issues of data privacy, security and breaches.

S&P Global Ratings on Thursday cut Brazil's long-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings by one notch to 'BB-' from 'BB'. The outlook on the ratings is stable. The stable outlook reflects our view that there is a less than one-in-three likelihood that we could raise or lower the ratings on Brazil over the coming year, said credit analyst Lisa Schineller in a statement. It also is indicative of Brazil's stable external position and the strength of its monetary policy that help to offset fiscal weakness and lower economic growth outlook than its peers. BB- is generally viewed as speculative by lenders.
Yellen also said she'd like more women to become economists.
It jolted the markets earlier this month, particularly since the general consensus had been that the BOJ was in [easy-money mode] for the long haul, wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets U.K. This month's actions have shown that can't be taken for granted, so markets will be paying close attention to not only what Kuroda does, but also how [he] guides future expectations of policy moves later on into 2018.
But they should be, he says, because a cut in the state's higher education budget can have a direct impact on a family's budget. Between 2008 and 2014—the same time states were walking back their investment in public colleges and universities -- tuition and fees at two-year and four-year public universities rose 28% on average. The skyrocketing student debt we see is a symptom of a disease and the disease we see is state disinvestment from higher education, said Allison, Young Invincibles' deputy director of policy and research.
What if you have some loser investments that you would like to unload? Biting the bullet and taking the resulting capital losses this year would shelter capital gains, including high-taxed short-term gains, from other sales this year.

Mester said there could be tapering of the bond buying program if there is a stronger second half than she expects.
U.K.'s May and ECB's Draghi: The European Central Bank left its key interest rates steady, as expected. Draghi at his press conference in Frankfurt said there's still no sign of a convincing upward trend in underlying inflation, although headline inflation will probably continue to rise because of higher energy prices.

The Georgia Senate race could result in an initial decline if Democrats sweep, as investors start to price in higher taxes on the wealthy. But, he says, increased investment in infrastructure, education and health care will take the economy, and stocks, higher in that scenario.
The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.03% , which measures the buck against a basket of six rival currencies, gave up 0.1% to 89.215. The moderate selloff reversed Monday's recovery in which the index inched up 0.4% and partly retraced last week's drop that sent it to a three-year low.
But here's another critical point that gets lost in the social-media scrum: Just because you're in a 24% tax bracket doesn't mean your entire income is taxed at 24%. Under current tax law, if you were a single person, you would only pay that 24% rate in 2019 on income between $84,201 and $168,400.
With state and local budgets squeezed by the pandemic and economic downturn — limiting the funding they can provide to schools — Walsh said it's likely schools will be laying off teachers in the coming months. Indeed, employment in local education, which includes teachers and others who work for schools, like custodians and cafeteria workers, has already dropped.
Investor optimism was further reinforced by comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who said during a Friday morning appearance that the jobs report didn't materially increase concerns over rising inflation, while reiterating that the central bank would continue to keep an open mind about how much it will raise interest rates in 2019 and how aggressively it will shrink its balance sheet, based on incoming data about the U.S. and global economy, including recent weakness in equity markets.
If you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. The federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels. The add-on 3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT) can also bite at high income levels. So, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised NIIT.

The ECB will meet in 10 days, and unless Mario Draghi finds a way to convince markets that the unwinding of stimulus will be very slow, I think the euro will be marching towards 1.25 by end of Q1, Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.

The overnight rate has a definite, albeit unquantifiable, effect on financial-asset prices, economic activity (via its influence on aggregate demand) and ultimately inflation. And while monetary policy is more potent than fiscal policy, the impact of any given change in the funds rate and, hence, the money supply varies from business cycle to business cycle. Which is why even the best monetary rule argues for a bit of discretion in its implementation.
He noted that fourth-quarter GDP is expected to come in below 1% and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index has been signaling a contraction in the sector for two months.
North Dakota and Alaska increased higher education spending by 38% and 6% respectively between 2008 and 2014, according to a report released Thursday by Young Invincibles, a nonprofit millennial advocacy group, which has pushed a platform for debt-free college that includes increased state investment. Every other state cut higher education funding during the same period, the report found. On average, states cut per student spending by 21% during that period.

According to my analysis, however, bitcoin is forming another triangle pattern and is likely to make another big move once a breakout occurs, wrote Colombo.

Our first step in this research was to consider which factors might be responsible for movement in the stock market in aggregate. Each firm that is represented in the stock market index produces a stream of revenues. After paying a portion to workers, the rest is left over as profits that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends. The stock price will rise whenever the rewards to the shareholders increase, which can be caused by one of three separate forces:

President-elect Joe Biden's incoming administration and the Democratic-run House of Representatives now won't face the same checks on their policy priorities that they would have faced with a Republican-controlled Senate, though analysts have said the slim Democratic majority in the chamber could mean more power for moderate senators from either party.
The narrow framing of what it means to be an educator combined with relatively low pay — the median pay for a high school teacher was $61,660 in 2019 — and decades of political battles over curriculum, the role of standardized testing and other issues have combined to create an environment where, teachers at the national level don't get the respect that they should, Starr said.

Treasury yields declined on Wednesday as details about President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy proposals weren't forthcoming at the President-elect's first news conference since the election. Instead, Trump addressed recent allegations that his campaign staff had been in contact with the Russian government, and that Russia's spy agencies had compromising information on the president-elect. A Trump lawyer also focused on how Trump would handle several conflicts of interest related to his business holdings. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note [s:TMUBMUSD10Y] fell two basis points to 3.658%, while the two-year yield [s:TMUBMUSD02Y] fell 1.4 basis point to 1.179%.

Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citi, who trimmed his 2019 target for the S&P 500 to 2,850 from 3,000, believes this is a good time to jump back into the market, in part given that stocks have the potential to rise 16% over the next 12 months on valuations alone.

A 2011 paper Clayton was involved in drafting for the New York City Bar Association complains about the federal government's broad enforcement of that law. The paper — titled The FCPA and its Impact on International Business Transactions: Should Anything Be Done to Minimize the Consequences of the U.S.'s Unique Position on Combating Offshore Corruption? — states that foreign companies are leery of deals that would bring them under the act's jurisdiction, such as listing on a U.S. exchange in an initial public offering or acquiring a U.S. company in a stock-for-stock exchange.

Trump proposed extending for three years protections for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, a step that early reports, including by the Wall Street Journal, was seen as a major concession inside the White House. Democrats have advocated for a path to permanent citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, although the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program so far provides temporary protections; it was created by President Obama via executive order after no action in Congress that frustrated the then-president. Pelosi reiterated this desire for permanency on Saturday, as has Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democrat who wrote the BRIDGE legislation that would extend this status.

Treasury yields cemented their fourth straight weekly drop on Friday, the longest winning streak since July, as attractive valuations and uncertainty over the details of President-elect Donald Trump's policies caused traders to rethink their positions.
Draghi insisted on the need for monetary policy to stay accommodative until inflation nears the central bank's target of 2%. He also added officials have yet to discuss how the ECB would go about ending quantitative easing, and that rate increases would only follow after the process had begun.
Call options represent bets that the level or price of a given asset or index will rise during a given time—in this case, the period between Friday and Feb. 15, when these options expire.
ECB President Mario Draghi did spell out concerns over the strengthening euro, saying the recent volatility represents a source of uncertainty and a risk to the region's growth outlook. He reiterated, however, that the bank doesn't target an exchange rate for competitive purposes, seen as a rebuke to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who in recent days have stated a weak dollar is good for U.S. trade.
In fact, having a capital loss carryover could turn out to be a pretty good deal. The carryover can be used to shelter both short-term gains and long-term gains recognized next year and beyond. This can give you extra investing flexibility in those years, because you won't have to hold appreciated securities for over a year to get a lower tax rate. You'll pay 0% to the extent you can shelter gains with your loss carryover. If there are future tax rate increases (which I think are unlikely through at least 2022), capital loss carryovers into future years could turn out to be really valuable.
The standstill in hiring female CEOs comes as women worldwide are sharing stories of how sexual harassment and assault has shaped their working lives, in some cases stopping their careers completely.

If anything, the strong euro will dampen inflation pressures and squeeze earnings. Anglo-American companies are more likely to pass along currency developments to customers, while Continental and Japanese businesses appear to put more emphasis on market share than short-term profitability are less likely, they said. The euro's 2.5% appreciation on a trade-weighted basis is tantamount to a 40 basis points tightening of monetary policy.
No, Mr. President-elect, the dollar is not too strong.
Gender pay gap figures don't adjust for job choice and duration, which all influence pay. Women dominate fields like education, which are not typically high-paying. Men dominate fields like IT, math, engineering and sciences, which tend to have higher-paying jobs. But as more women have achieved a college education and entered the workforce over the last half-century, the gender wage gap has improved. In 1960, women were paid around 61 cents on the dollar compared with men.
There appears to be some momentum for reversing the ban. The Obama administration launched a pilot program in 2015 to provide access to Pell grants for some prisoners as a way to test the impact of a possible policy change.

If you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. The federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels. The add-on 3.8% net investment income tax (NIIT) can also bite at high income levels. So, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised NIIT.

My answer is: most likely. Corrections can happen at any time, but to get a real bear market we need a recession, and no recession is in sight for the U.S. economy in 2017. A recession may very well happen during the first term of the Trump presidency, since the present economic expansion will be eight years long (or 96 months) this June. After that point, there would have been only two expansions longer than 96 months: March 1991 to March 2001 (120 months) and February 1961 to December 1969 (106 months; please see this table).

She was also critical that the Trump plan did not give priority to reopening the partially closed government first, before resuming border security talks.

President Donald Trump said privately several times last year that he wanted to withdraw the U.S. from NATO, the New York Times reported Monday night. Citing senior administration officials, the Times said the idea was expressed around the tumultuous NATO summit last summer in Brussels, with Trump saying he didn't see the point of the U.S. belonging to NATO. Sources told the Times that they worry Trump could again seek to withdraw from NATO now that the calming influence of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is gone and as European military spending continues to lag. Experts told the Times that withdrawing from NATO would be a catastrophe for U.S. foreign policy, sabotaging 70 years of U.S. efforts and handing a huge victory to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has repeatedly sought to undermine NATO.

So far, that's been the case with the partial shutdown that began on Dec. 21 and entered its 26th day on Wednesday with no end in sight with congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump at an impasse over his demand for funding for a $5.3 billion border wall. The closure has far exceeded the prior record, a 21-day shutdown during the Clinton administration that began in December 1995.

The 2008 global financial crisis, coupled with the disappointing recovery in the advanced economies that followed, injected a new urgency into China's efforts to shift its growth model from one based on investment and external demand to one underpinned by domestic consumption. Navigating such a structural transition without causing a sharp decline in economic growth would be difficult for any country. The challenge is even greater for a country as large and complex as China, especially given today's environment of sluggish global growth.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. energy sector will see more bankruptcies, mergers and restructurings this year given the outlook for continued low oil prices, said Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan on Monday. The overall tone in the oil and gas sector has soured, as expectations have decidedly shifted to an 'even lower for even longer' price outlook in the wake of the December OPEC meeting, Kaplan said in a speech in Dallas. Economists at the Dallas Fed forecast that global excess inventories aren't likely to begin falling until 2017, and there is a risk that it will take longer, he said. Given the various cross-currents, the ultimate timing of reaching market production/consumption balance remains uncertain, he added. Kaplan is not a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year. He said he was in favor of the December interest-rate increase, the first since 2006.

Overall, Fed officials re-affirmed at this meeting that they anticipate raising interest rates three times in 2018, matching the tightening in 2017, but we still anticipate that a slightly faster than expected rebound in core inflation will mean we eventually see four rate hikes in 2018, said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in a Wednesday note following the release of minutes.

4. Growth stocks are much more significantly overvalued at present, relative to value stocks. And large-cap stocks have outperformed small-cap stocks over about the last five years, as well. Given this, a long-term allocation of part of an investment portfolio to U.S. small cap value stocks makes sense. Emerging markets stocks are another area that appears to have lower values, relative to other stocks. While volatile, an allocation to emerging markets stocks for a small part of an investment portfolio could significantly add to returns over the long term (10 years or more), provided rebalancing of the portfolio occurs periodically.
There's detailed data on the drop in enrollment in teacher preparation programs, but we don't have the other side of the equation, which is the demand side, Partelow said.

Taxpayers reporting income in those ranges would see their marginal tax rate rise from 28% under current policy to 33% under the plan Trump proposed during his campaign.

In Europe, stocks rose, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, +0.88% edging up 0.1%.
The index fell to 57.6% in December, from 60.7%, and below economists expectations of 58.7%, according to a MarketWatch poll. Nevertheless, any reading of 55% or more is considered exceptional, so the report reflects brisk business even as conditions have worsened slightly.
Furthermore, the torrid equity rally that followed the election has effectively stalled. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , which only recently came within a hair's breadth of 20,000, has retreated.
Parkey's profile was public but has since been made private, and Venmo does not show the total number of payments made for a particular reason, even if the person in question has privacy settings on public.
For now China has abandoned its experiment with new circuit breakers that triggered the wider panic. As Nomura comments, the circuit breakers were well-intended but functioned as super-charged accelerators for investor fears and market volatility.
 It may be tempting to fault the savers for this sad state of affairs, but it is wrong to blame the victim. 
The biggest issue [for the Treasury market] is going to be when Trump comes in what policies will we get and how quickly will we get them in place, said Larry Milstein, managing director of government and agency trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co.
U.S. stocks closed down Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 600 points as Apple Inc. posted its biggest percentage drop since 2013 while investors reacted badly to a weaker-than-expected reading on manufacturing activity.
As the 2020 campaign for president (and other offices) heats up, addressing student debt may provide an opportunity for both Democrats and Republicans to lure voters who may feel more of a sense of urgency surrounding their student loan bill than addressing college costs for their future children, Huelsman added.
Stein: In public policy I think about how can I create incentives, and avoid disincentives, for people to engage in certain behavior. It is very difficult to discover, investigate and bring enforcement actions in the accounting area, for example in complex accounting fraud.
He also took a shot at Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +1.53% , which Apple has been in litigation with over patent rights. The issue that we have with Qualcomm is that they have a policy of no license, no chips. This is, in our view, illegal, he said, claiming there have not been any settlement talks — a comment that Qualcomm later called misleading.
In many ways, it is this recognition that has underpinned the U.K.'s post–World War II policy of constructive engagement. Notwithstanding an initial reluctance to join the EEC, the U.K. helped to foster the development of modern institutions in Germany. It supported the 1970s democratisation of Spain, Portugal, and Greece and, ultimately, the unification of Germany.
Spoofing is when traders place large bids or offers in the futures market with the intent to cancel before execution after another smaller bid or offer is placed on the opposite side of the same market. The purpose of the scheme is to create the false appearance of market depth, which in turn creates the impression of greater buying or selling interest than legitimately exists.
The big lie is that it will lead to restaurants sharing these tips with back of house, said Shierholz, senior economist and director policy at the Economic Policy Institute. Instead, she said employers will be able to control tips and take a big chunk of them as long as they pay the minimum wage. The proposal would require staff to make minimum wage, but allow tips to be pooled beyond that. (A spokesman for the Department of Labor said it intends to publish an informed cost benefit analysis as part of any final rule.)

Jason Furman, who was President Obama's chief economist, said Blanchard's comments were groundbreaking.
The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average logged fresh records on the back of robust earnings but both indexes finished off intraday highs in volatile trading as the buck rebounded following President Donald Trump's dollar-supportive comments.

Elsewhere, Chinese President Xi Jinping made a strong defense of global trade on Tuesday at the Davos gathering, curiously--some say--positioning Xi as the bigger advocate of economic orthodoxy, including globalization.
Tesco PLC TSCO, +0.18% TSCDY, -0.43% fell 4.3%. Britain's largest supermarket chain said it's confident in its outlook for fiscal 2018, after like-for-like U.K. sales rose 1.9% during the Christmas period. But slower sales of general merchandise and tobacco dragged on overall performance.
China on Monday announced its economy expanded by 6.6% over a year earlier, down from 2017's 6.9%. Growth in the three months ending in December cooled to 6.4% from the previous quarter's 6.5%. China's communist leaders are trying to steer China to slower, more self-sustaining growth based on consumer spending instead of trade and investment. But the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting Beijing to ease lending controls and step up government spending to shore up growth and avoid politically dangerous job losses. The lackluster data raised hopes for more policy action.
The choice to offer a full refund was somewhat unusual on Royal Caribbean's part, as a result. Cruise lines look at this sort of thing on a case by case basis and how disruptive this was to passengers, McDaniel said. Given that Oasis of the Seas had to skip two ports of call and return a day early, McDaniel said it was abundantly clear to Royal Caribbean that the illness outbreak adversely affected passengers' experience even if they weren't sick.
15. Rick Fleming, the Securities and Exchange Commission's investor advocate, said in a report to Congress that financial advisers should be authorized to protect clients from elder fraud. Financial firms should have the ability to pause disbursements of funds, contrary to the explicit instructions of a customer, if there is a reasonable belief that financial exploitation is occurring, he said. A strong suspicion of elder fraud should trigger an obligation to notify adult protective services, Fleming wrote. ThinkAdvisor

In a move showing House Democrat interest in moving beyond Obamacare, the chairman of the House Budget Committee is asking the Congressional Budget Office to set out the parameters of how a single-payer system would work.
Beijing is now walking a delicate path, as the more expectations grow of currency weakness, the greater the risks of a stampede in capital outflows. And today China's currency markets are much more plugged into global markets than its stock indices after efforts to internationalize the yuan USDCNY, +0.07% , meaning the potential contagion here is more obvious.
The study analyzed U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances data from 1989 to 2019 on households with at least one resident member under 18. The sample included 19,013 households.
The request, from House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth, is notable in that it's not asking the CBO to provide a cost estimate. A controversial study from the Mercatus Center estimates a $32.6 trillion cost over a decade.

Perhaps those analysts predicting greater future volatility are simply suffering from recency bias — the behavioral-finance phenomenon involving extrapolating the recent past into the future. It may serve investors well to look a little further back into history before forming expectations following the Fed rate hike. Returns may indeed be lower in the near future, but it may not be as volatile a ride as many anticipate.
Knowing the market might close, investors were rushing to sell, leading to a mere 15-minute trading session on Thursday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% has been whiplashing in the past couple of weeks as trade-war related headlines, speculation over the Fed's policy stance and economic data have played havoc with market sentiment. In perhaps the most dramatic sign of what investors are having to contend with, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% went from having the worst start to a year since 2000 on Jan. 3 to posting year-to-date gains of more than 3% Wednesday.
Addressing student debt is probably more analogous to addressing housing affordability or addressing health care or addressing anything that is impacting a family's bottom line, Huelsman said.
In early 2020, John Larson, the president of Oregon Education Association, the state's teacher's union, was preparing to head to Minneapolis for a national conference on what he and fellow teacher advocates were worried was becoming, as Larson put it, a crisis: Too few teachers to meet the needs of the nation's schools.
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard warned against additional rate increases in the absence of inflationary pressure, citing the recession risk being telegraphed by the long end of the bond market, which is driving the yield-curve flattening.

Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation, says that most people assume reducing the number of tax brackets is one way to simplify the U.S.'s extraordinarily complex tax code — which has been a rallying cry for politicians, particularly on the Republican side of the aisle. The tax code contains about 4 million words — longer than the Bible, as Sen. Ted Cruz famously noted.

Warnock then made comments on CNN just before 8 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday.
A Federal Reserve that was viewed as being overly ambitious in its attempt to normalize rates from crisis-era policy also was seen as a point of friction for investors, perhaps, amplified by dread that the U.S.-China trade spat would help to further gum up global economic expansion.

This all points to two possibilities: Romaine lettuce may not be the source of the outbreak. Or, perhaps more concerning, it could be an indication of manufacturing-related issues, Marler said. Either that, or the food that caused the outbreak was produced on a farm that had a contamination, Marler said.
I'm glad that you finally realized that you cannot live her life for her. You deserve a happy life, one where you are free to enjoy the small moments and look forward to a secure future. That's nothing to feel guilty about. Plenty of children would have walked away. You didn't. This is something that your mother was either unable or unwilling to provide for you. In the face of remarkable odds, you provided it for yourself. And yet you are still thinking of others.
2. Interest rate rises are likely to be modest, but will still affect bond returns. As interest rates rise, the value of bonds fall. The longer the duration of the bond, the more likely its fall in price. Since fixed income investments are a defensive part of a portfolio, designed in part to offer some stability to the overall value of the portfolio, retirees might consider instituting a ladder of CDs, purchased directly from banks (and keeping within FDIC limits). Most CDs over 1 year in maturity can be redeemed early with a 180-day interest penalty; if interest rates rise significantly, retirees can exercise this put, in essence, when it makes sense to incur the penalty to reap the higher interest rates for the remainder of the original CD term. A short-term bond fund may be added to the fixed income part of the portfolio, to provide some liquidity. Never forget the threat of inflation; while inflation has been low over the past decade, in particular, it could come roaring back at any time; a ladder of inflation-protected securities held in a tax-deferred (401(k) or IRA) account, or a bond fund containing TIPS, might be a prudent part of a person's fixed income portfolio, to help guard against inflation risk.
And, if that's not bad enough, here's another one.
Though Ocasio-Cortez added that the 70% rate wouldn't apply to all of that income, that detail seemed to get lost in the contentious aftermath. Her comments were widely interpreted as meaning that she wanted the federal government to take 70% of Americans' income in taxes, a view Scalise broadcast on Twitter TWTR, -1.47% .
It seems the one constant in gold pricing throughout last year that continues to this day is that dollar strength or weakness has been the strongest force affecting its movement, wrote analyst Gary Wagner of The Gold Forecast, in a Thursday post.
The students' perception of what's going on now, how that will drive them and help them decide that they want to help students — that's yet to be seen, Barber said.

AUD/JPY in particular is worth watching. Beyond representing a global proxy for risk appetite and the carry trade, the pair also has a strong correlation with major equity indices and so far, the outlook appears bleak. With today's drop, AUD/JPY has fallen conclusively below the four-month bullish trend line off the August lows, carving out a potential large Bearish Marubozu Candle* in the process. For the uninitiated, this pattern shows strong selling pressure and often portends more weakness in the coming days.

Shares of Ford Motor Co. F, -5.38% fell 0.6% in premarket trade Wednesday, after the automaker reported preliminary 2018 earnings that were below expectations, and outlined its plan for a global redesign of its vehicle lineup. The company said 2018 earnings per share was 92 cents, compared with $1.90 a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, Ford said adjusted 2018 EPS was $1.30, below the FactSet consensus of $1.33. Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said the external challenges the company faced included commodity costs, unfavorable currency exchange effects, policy changes, a decline of business in China and higher warranty costs in North America. As part of its plan to redesign its lineup, Ford said it will refresh 75% of its lineup in North America over the next 24 months, including increasing the mix of its SUVs and fortifying its truck franchise. In addition, Ford said it will introduce 10 new Ford and Lincoln products in China this year, and more than 30 products by 2021. We are bolstering our portfolio to capture a healthy share of higher growth and higher profit segments and partnering where appropriate to improve profitability and returns, said Jim Farley, president of global markets. Ford's stock has gained 0.5% over the past three months through Tuesday, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% has lost 7.1%.

Borrowers choose ARMs because the initial rates on adjustables are lower than the rates on fixed-rate mortgages. This gives borrowers lower monthly payments in the first few years. ARM borrowers take the risk that their rates and monthly payments could climb when the rate-adjustment period begins.

An increasingly urban society requires better commuter-mass transit and intercity connections. Financing infrastructure runs smack into the exorbitant costs imposed by cumbersome regulations and costly delays imposed by federal, state and local agencies. Engaging Trump on regulatory reform and encouraging a special dialogue with governors about prohibitive delays could help.
9. Save with purpose, says Malani. Rather than have one big savings account for everything, you should have different accounts for different goals: In 2019, put purpose behind your savings. Start by deciding what you're saving for (i.e. trip to Portugal, new West Elm couch, etc.). Then set up a separate savings account for each thing or experience you're saving for. Finally, nickname the savings account in accordance with its designated purpose. You'll be much less likely to 'borrow' money from your Portugal vacay account than just a general savings account, she explains.
The biggest risk to the outlook according to Fed officials was a continued drop in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate dropped to a nine-year low of 4.6% in November.

It is suddenly popular in the central banking community to suggest the Federal Reserve should adopt a new interest-rate approach, known as price-level targeting, especially after it was given the thumbs-up by none other than Ben Bernanke.
Taking a cue from market sectors, the Nasdaq 100 NDX, -3.13% made an all-time high last week (see chart). This suggests that investors' appetite for risk is alive and well. This time the move in the Nasdaq 100 is very different than the move that culminated in the technology bust of 2000, as today it is driven by earnings. While the technology sector did initially underperform when the Trumpnado hit the stock market right after the election (denoted in the dip at the end in the relative chart here), that appears to have ended as the relative action of the Nasdaq 100 compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has now turned up.
Growth in Germany's manufacturing sector slowed, according to Markit's purchasing manager's index, which fell to a 33-month low of 51.5, further raising concerns about a global economic slowdown that investors worry could spill over into the U.S.

Of course, history is never destiny, and Coolidge is only one observation — hardly a solid basis for a forecast. Moreover, unlike Trump, both Coolidge and Mellon were level-headed and temperate in their manner.
Bond traders pay close attention to inflation data because investors typically demand higher returns to offset rising consumer prices. Rising inflation erodes the value of a bond's fixed payments, particularly in longer-dated paper.
The U.S. dollar rebounded from an initial dip against its rivals following the December jobs report, but still registered its third consecutive weekly loss. The employment report came in below expectations and showed that wage growth remained sluggish, turning the greenback negative before it bounced back.

Like letgo, OfferUp connects buyers and sellers through its app, which it claims is the largest mobile-only marketplace of its kind. Upload photos of products to the service and use the app's chat feature to arrange a meet-up and sale. Like other classified services, it runs the risk of scams and safety issues when users meet up to make sales and has a number of safety tips on its website to decrease these risks. The app offers users the option to verify their identity through their state ID and Facebook log in.

The S&P 500 SPX, -0.16% and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.39% are both tentatively higher at the year's start, but that comes after a disastrous month resulted in both benchmarks producing their worst Decembers since 1931.

In a nationwide report released Thursday, Generation Progress, the youth-focused arm of the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, noted that Connecticut is the first state to pass a student loan bill of rights with an ombudsman, the servicer licensing requirement and other consumer protections for borrowers. The report highlighted Connecticut's efforts as one of the ways states can take action on the student debt crisis without waiting for the federal government. Other states are attacking the student loan crisis in different ways, the report noted, including, working to help borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates, holding for-profit colleges accountable and reversing laws that penalized student loan borrowers behind on their payments by taking away their driver's or professional license.

Buy the rumor, sell the news: This saying is more relevant to day traders than long-term investors. There are occasionally short-term trading opportunities surrounding rumors — be it economic reports, company-specific announcements or other developments. Buying when the rumor surfaces (and prices are still low) can benefit traders when the news appears and lifts prices.

Aside from the beginning of Trump's first 100 days in office, a period where investors expect Trump to begin implementing his plans for infrastructure spending, trade and deregulation, there are no clear market-moving catalysts, Bier said.
At the moment, the Fed targets an inflation rate. Under price-level targting, the Fed would target the level of prices. If the price level is low for a time, the Fed would need to allow inflation to run hot to get back to the price-level target.
Left unaddressed, poverty among the elderly could drive up federal income tax rates by 10 percentage points. The expenses of poor or near-poor older Americans will inevitably be passed on to other citizens, from higher Medicaid entitlements (for nursing homes and assisted living costs) to the taxpayer burden from a spike in homelessness.
As Democrats take control of the House, one of the party's big pushes is to resurrect the so-called Gephardt Rule, which in past decades has helped lawmakers limit fights over raising the debt ceiling.

The dollar was whacked lower as the market reacted to the weaker-than-expected jobs report. The U.S. added only 148,000 jobs in December, compared with the MarketWatch consensus forecast of 195,000. Wages grew by 2.5% in the 12 months leading up to December, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. Wages are also used as a gauge for inflation, which has been stubbornly low.
And the opposite seems to be true too. If you were tall throughout most of high school (as many tall people were) you were even more likely to participate in the stock market as an adult. Addoum says that those who were tall in high school tended to have higher self-esteem in high school.

Many market strategists believe the August devaluation convinced the Federal Reserve to delay its first interest-rate increase in nearly a decade.
Last week I wrote that as the value of both China's currency and equity markets are so dependent on government intervention, this presents an important and hard-to-quantify risk factor.
Because of the time the hybrid process saves, Chen said that the hybrid approach has resulted in a 26% savings on average for mortgage borrowers. Appraisals can cost anywhere from $315 to more than $1,000 depending on the complexity of the project, according to HomeAdvisor.
It feels like a brand new day, the New York lawmaker said. For too long, much-needed help has been stalled or diluted by a Republican-led Senate and President Trump. That will change with a Democratic Senate, Democratic House, and a Democratic President.
Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. equity strategist at Citi, who trimmed his 2019 target for the S&P 500 to 2,850 from 3,000, believes this is a good time to jump back into the market, in part given that stocks have the potential to rise 16% over the next 12 months on valuations alone.
Fitch's sanguine assumption of the central government stepping in depends on how much capital China's banks may need. Analyst Charlene Chu at Autonomous Economics, estimates this figure could be as high as $7.7 trillion of new capital in the next three years.

If the challenges of climate change are not met today, huge burdens will be imposed on the next generation. It is just wrong for this generation to pass these costs on to the next. It is better to leave a legacy of financial debts, which our children can somehow manage, than to hand down a possibly unmanageable environmental disaster.
Meanwhile, weak readings on consumer sentiment and retail sales didn't have much of an impact on the market, analysts said.

European stocks finished lower Monday, weighed as the euro continued to march up further into three-year highs, giving a key regional benchmark its third drop in four sessions.
Meanwhile, silver enjoyed a gain, outperforming its sister metal. March silver US:SIH7 added 12.6 cents, or 0.7%, to $17.274 an ounce.
If anything, the strong euro will dampen inflation pressures and squeeze earnings. Anglo-American companies are more likely to pass along currency developments to customers, while Continental and Japanese businesses appear to put more emphasis on market share than short-term profitability are less likely, they said. The euro's 2.5% appreciation on a trade-weighted basis is tantamount to a 40 basis points tightening of monetary policy.
European stock markets erased earlier gains and turned firmly lower on Thursday, yanked lower by a euro rally after the European Central Bank said eurozone growth was surprisingly strong and offered only limited pushback against the Trump administration's embrace of dollar weakness.
Stock movers: Pandora shares PNDORA, +4.12% tumbled 10.7%, their worst session since August, according to FactSet.

Oil futures rose, with the U.S. benchmark US:CLG9 emerging from a bear market, and closed well above $50 a barrel, while gold futures US:GCG9 settled higher and the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.07% traded sharply lower.
Rising college costs also mean that these recent graduates who may not be working in a job that uses their degree are likely faced with student loans. About 44 million Americans are coping with $1.4 trillion in student debt.
Crude-oil futures US:CLG9 rose more than 1%, while gold prices US:GCG9 settled slightly higher and the dollar DXY, +0.07% fell.
* Finally, consider accelerating elective medical procedures, dental work, and expenditures for vision care. For 2020, you can deduct medical expenses to the extent they exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI), assuming you itemize. Next year, the deduction threshold is scheduled to rise to 10% of AGI, but I doubt Congress will allow that to happen.

Traders now estimate the chance of three rate hikes this year to have risen above 50%, according to fed fund futures data. That's in line with the so-callled dot plot, an aggregate of senior Fed officials' projections for interest rates, which showed a median forecast of three hikes in 2018.
We will use the revenue from this tax to make public colleges and universities tuition free. During the financial crisis, the middle class of this country bailed out Wall Street. Now, it's Wall Street's turn to help the middle class.
Energy and consumer discretionary stocks have been the biggest outperformers of the year so far, with both sectors up nearly 6%. Broadly, markets have been supported by improving economic data and an accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The recently passed tax bill, which will cut corporate-tax rates, has also been cited as a tailwind driving markets. Separately, corporate earnings have been strong both in the U.S. and internationally.
And nearly 80% of the tips that would be taken from employees would come out of the pockets of female tipped workers, according to the Economic Policy Institute. An economic analysis showing these negative effects of the change was scrubbed by the Department of Labor, a new report from the Economic Policy Institute reported, showing the lengths to which the Trump administration ... will go to hide the fact that they are taking steps to actively make workers' lives worse, it said. (The Department of Labor did not respond to request for comment.)
The other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of Dow 20,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has been above 19,000 since November, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier, which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published. Whatever happens, Dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.
A move in this direction would require considerable debate and reflection, but might also confer substantial benefits to the U.S. economy if it could be implemented effectively, Bullard said.

Democrats try to rein in Ocasio-Cortez: Politico reports some members of the House Democratic caucus are mounting an operation to bring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into the fold, after becoming exasperated with the anti-establishment democratic socialist.
The Republicans, not surprisingly, are fighting and will continue to fight against all of the structural reforms that would democratize this country, and that would thereby vastly reduce their chances of holding national power. Together with the policy differences between the parties, this reality will remain the long-run, material basis for an increasing partisan divide, until these structural problems are resolved.
Investors are most immediately saying this is going to mean more money spent in support of individuals and a greater likelihood of an infrastructure deal, she said. But buried in all this is probably also an assumption that it will be easier to get money to states for a more efficient rollout of the vaccine.

Gold rose around 0.5% last week, and 6.3% in December, and nearly 25% in 2020, with gains slowed to a mere 0.3% rise in the last three months of 2020.
A measure of volatility on Wall Street on Monday rose to its highest level in more than 5 months as U.S. equity benchmarks dipped and as the yield in a benchmark Treasury note climbed to its highest level in more than three years. The CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% was up about 18% at 13.03, marking its highest level since Aug. 18, 2017, according to FactSet data. The VIX uses bullish and bearish option bets on the S&P 500 index to reflect expected volatility over the coming 30 days, and it typically rises as stocks fall. However, the gauge, sometimes referred to as the fear index, has been abnormally low, trading below its historical average at around 20. To be sure, it is still holding at a level below that historic mean but its recent pick up suggests that investors are betting that volatility will accelerate over the coming days and months. A rise in 10-year Treasury note yield TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% above 2.71% also has drawn attention, because rising rates can undercut appetite for stocks if government paper offer richer yields than risk assets like stocks. Rising yields, President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve's updated policy statement on Wednesday and a bevy of earnings set to be released throughout the week could induce choppy trade in an otherwise subdued market.

For the pound, investors will be keeping an eye out for debates in U.K. parliament over Brexit, due to take place Tuesday and Wednesday. The U.K. currency continues to draw support from last week's news that Spanish and Dutch finance ministers may be backing a soft Brexit, which would keep the U.K. from being shut out of trading with its biggest partner.
Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +2.43% said profit fell in the fourth quarter, the first full quarter after a sales-tactics scandal forced the resignation of longtime chief executive John Stumpf.
The risk, as underlined by Boone, is that governments might panic at the size of their debt loads relative to GDP once the recovery is really in sight — in the second half of the year. And, as she explains, governments should try to avoid the mistakes they made right after the global financial crisis of 2008, by rushing into austerity much too soon.
Yet, all of her work and the work of other so-called side hustlers or gig workers who typically take on multiple jobs, is essentially invisible in the eyes of the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. Though the agency is a key source of information about the labor market, it doesn't keep tabs on how much people make in what the government calls non-primary work.

But Stanley said that further out, the incoming Biden administration could struggle to win very many legislative victories on controversial bills given the razor-thin majorities in both chambers of Congress.
It used to be that the stock market was almost exclusively for the wealthy. Regular working folk didn't own stocks, but the destruction of defined-benefit pensions and the advent of do-it-yourself retirement savings changed all that. Now, although the top 1% still owns more than a third of all shares, and the top 10% owns more than 80%, about half of Americans own at least a few shares.
With job growth and wage growth continuing to beat investor expectations, it makes it very difficult to argue that the Fed should come to a complete halt in hiking interest rates, or that the economy is meaningfully weakening, Willie Delwiche, investment strategist with R.W. Baird, told MarketWatch.
We do worry about affordability, particularly in some areas that have lower inventory of homes for sale, says Randy Hopper, senior vice president of home lending for Navy Federal Credit Union. The places with low inventory tend to be places where home prices rise fastest, as the demand for homes exceeds supply.
The Bank of Japan, meanwhile, is thought of as having the most accommodative monetary policy among its peers. Still, a decision to reduce its purchases of government bonds, also known as JGBs, earlier this month and comments about the negative effects of prolonged quantitative easing late last year, have analysts wondering when the BOJ will take action and push the yen USDJPY, -0.01% higher.
Headlines such as Volatility Is the Name of the Game Heading Into 2016, and How to Navigate Volatile Stock Markets in 2016 have appeared in the past week. A recent Gallup poll indicated that 62% of U.S. investors are concerned with stock market volatility, up from 53% in February.
At nine of the 14 colleges studied by the GAO, officials and students had difficulty fully understanding the rules around college student SNAP eligibility.

That compares with a 0.6% gain in November.

Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Australia, didn't take Friday's gains as a total turnaround just yet. It needs to carry into next week for a rebound to be confirmed, he said. For now, the drop shouldn't be looked at anything but a minor pullback.
It wasn't just equities that showed lower volatility in restrictive monetary conditions. Treasury bonds, high-yield bonds, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) also experienced less volatility in the past when the Fed was hiking rates.

Mortgage lenders learned an enduring lesson in the housing crisis a decade ago: Make sure borrowers can repay their loans. So lenders tightened mortgage standards, partly on their own and partly in response to a regulatory crackdown on risky mortgages. These changes made it harder to get a home loan.
Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, takes a contrary view, noting that what happens in Shanghai has tended to have very little to do with what happens in New York. And he has the charts to back it up (see below).

The monthly premium for the current year depends on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), as reported on your Form 1040 for two years earlier. Strange but true. For example, your 2019 premiums depend on your 2017 MAGI. MAGI means the adjusted gross income (AGI) amount shown on page 1 of your Form 1040 plus any tax-exempt interest income.
But getting an ARM can be a good strategy for borrowers who don't plan to overstay the initial interest rate. A 3/1 ARM, for example, has a lower introductory rate that lasts three years and then adjusts annually afterward. Someone getting, say, a 5/1 ARM is betting that they'll refinance or sell the home within five years or so, before the rate potentially adjusts upward.
Looking into 2021 and beyond, regardless of age, health or status, more Americans are acknowledging their own mortality and the importance of protecting their loved ones.

Divorce can be one of the most financially devastating life events, so get an up-to-date assessment of your spouse's accounts. Opening someone else's mail is illegal, Slowiaczek says. You can, however, make a note of the financial institution that mails statements. If you give us those names, we can subpoena that information. (Most financial statements arrive between the 3rd and 8th of the month, he says, as they're usually mailed at the end of every month.) Accountant records are also a fertile ground for information on a spouse's financial affairs, he adds, and can also be subpoenaed.
(According to PCAOB audit standards, auditors are required, under section 10A(b)1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to make a report to the SEC if a client's illegal act has a material effect on the financial statements and if the firm is prevented from investigating the impact of the illegal act on the financial statements or informing the client's audit committee. It may be also be necessary for the auditor to resign if the company's board of directors does not take appropriate action.)
As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton's proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street's excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can't be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.
The same CDC data through May 2020 show that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are driving the increases. Given that men have a larger share of fentanyl-overdose deaths than prescription-opioid-overdose deaths, this suggests that men would be disproportionately represented among 2020 NCEDs, he concluded.

That step — which places the renminbi on par with the major global currencies (the U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen) — will enhance public- and private-sector acceptance of China's currency in the international monetary system. At the same time, it created the expectation — though not the obligation — that China will refrain from aggravating global financial instability.
Still trillions more dollars are needed but the federal deficit is already too big and someone has to pay. Many members of Congress reflexively balk at higher gas taxes and user-fees solutions but Leaders Pelosi and Chuck Schumer could triangulate the issue with Trump.

The Fed also said it would no longer preemptively hike its benchmark interest rate to ward off expected inflation, which had been standard Fed policy going back to the 1950s. Under the new commitment, the Fed won't move until it actually sees rising inflation.
Deaths from opioid-related overdoses are still rising. Prescription opioids are involved in 40% of all opioid overdoses, according to a report published by the CDC last year, and they're frequently the first opioids that people encounter before eventually moving on to illicit opioids.

So far, Connecticut is leading the charge on these efforts, but Lesser said he's heard from lawmakers in other states interested in introducing similar legislation. In addition to the Bill of Rights, Lesser worked with his colleagues on the higher education committee to lower interest rates on state-sponsored student loans and to create a vehicle to allow borrowers to refinance their debt at lower interest rates, a step other states and localities are taking as well.
All this may disappoint the combative political instincts of Pelosi and Trump but winning long-term majorities—holding power by governing effectively—requires moving to where the American people really stand—in the pragmatic center.
At the moment, the Fed has a 2% inflation target. But inflation has been mostly below that level since 2012. This has led to soul searching among some policy-makers, and those who track their actions, for a new approach, Bullard noted.

Ranney and Gold argue that drawing a line between deaths of despair and political policies to reduce social distancing is a crude one. It is also wrong to imply that reopening the country will, in and of itself, stop deaths of despair. Jobs may or may not rebound when social distancing rules are relaxed. Much of the decline in travel and eating in restaurants predated formal rules about social distancing.

Since then, it has moved up to 2.63%, and yields are expected to continue rising alongside interest rates. Goldman Sachs expects the 10-year yield to end 2018 at 2.9%, and for it to continue climbing for the foreseeable future, hitting 3.3% in 2019 and 3.5% in 2020. This would mean a decline in the price of the 10-year over the next three years, as prices and yields move inversely to each other.

When monetary policy tightens, it has an immediate negative influence on economic growth, while fiscal-policy improvements take a long time to work their way through the system.

Rosengren: I think there are some advantages of having a Fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.

Inflation would still be, I think, in a range that it wouldn't be affecting decision-making by households or firms but would give you a little more flexibility to reduce the probability that you hit zero during recessions. So if we were to have a recession right now, most recessions we move interest rates by much more than 300 basis points. If you look at where the [Fed forecasts] in December had the fed funds in the long run, [2.8%] it is low enough that more than likely in most recessions we'd hit zero. That is a concern.

The one bright spot from the bloodletting at the end of 2018 is that expectations have been diminished, leading Wall Street to expect slower revenue and earnings growth. With much more subdued results now expected for many tech companies, strong growth is likely to be rewarded and slowing growth may not be punished as harshly as it was late last year. As was the case last quarter, all companies will likely be judged more on their outlook than their past results, as investors try to get a handle on where the tech boom will go from here.

That means if the S&P 500 remains at its Friday close of 2,532 and earnings estimates in 2019 pan out accurately, the index should trade at multiple of 14.6 times earnings in 2019. But if earnings fail to grow altogether, the index would trade at a price-earnings multiple, a popular way of valuing stocks, of 15.6 times earnings in 2019. To be sure, that would mark a substantial drop from around 20 times 12-month trailing earnings at the start of the year.

The U.S. central bank should be able to avoid drama like the infamous taper tantrum of 2013, said Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, on Friday. We've learned the lessons of the past and are being thoughtful and watchful as the year unfolds, Harker said. While it should be a year of developments, it should also be a boring one, he said. Harker said the Fed has never before faced a need to shrink its balance sheet from $4.5 trillion, but said the process should remain slow and mechanical. The Philadelphia Fed President, who is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate committee this year, said he thinks two rate increases this year would be the appropriate path of policy.
It's not that the Fed is here to save the markets from volatility,' he added. But the magnitude of the pullback we've had, around 20%, tells you something about what the market believes about the underlying economy.

Despite the European Central Bank not changing its outlook or interest rates, the euro soared during today's lunchtime press conference. The market had expected Mario Draghi to come out and temper expectations by talking down the recent euro appreciation, as he has done in the past.

The hallmark of Trump's plan, which the Tax Foundation has estimated could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade in lost tax revenue, is lowering the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 33%.

The currency was lower ahead of the overnight release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes after hitting fresh 14-year highs Tuesday.

And it's why it is a mistake to look at long-term rates in isolation. What matters is their interaction with the policy rate. The fed funds/10-year spread has narrowed from an ultra-wide 365 basis points in 2010 to 120 basis points today, which still provides an incentive to depository institutions. The failure of long rates to match the Fed's rate increases means the Fed has less room to tighten policy, especially as the effects of balance-sheet reduction start to kick in.
The researchers estimate that if 50% of the eligible prisoner population took advantage of the program and took post-secondary classes while behind bars their likelihood of employment after release would on average jump by nearly 10%. The employment rate among all formerly incarcerated workers would also rise 2.1%.
The report also suggests FNS work more closely with SNAP agencies to make it easier for eligible college students to access food stamps.

The rule establishes a test for determining independent contractor status under the Federal Labor Standards Act, giving more weight to two of five factors, which critics say are favorable to gig companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. UBER and Lyft Inc. LYFT: the nature and degree of the worker's control over the work, and the worker's opportunity for profit or loss based on initiative and/or investment. The other factors are skill, permanence of the working relationship and whether the work is part of an integrated unit of production.
As mentioned before, 2019 will remain a seller's market, where would-be buyers outnumber the supply of homes they can afford. But that doesn't mean home sellers can expect bidding wars from desperate buyers.

Another reason for the lack of certainty with the government estimates: There are big gaps in the Contingent Worker Supplement.

An ugly, year-end stock-market selloff and the return of volatility has put the economic expansion, soon to be the longest on record, under the microscope. Cyclical sectors, such as housing, are slowing, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
From the beginning of 2018 to mid-December, 30-year fixed mortgage rates went up a little less than three-quarters of a percentage point, to around 4.75%. Forecasters expect mortgage rates to rise again in 2019 — but at a slower pace.

The current spread between the effective funds rate and 10-year Treasury is about 30 basis points. Historically, a spread that narrow has been either a precursor to inversion (the Fed ignores the signal and keeps raising rates) or the start of a capitulation (the Fed realizes the error of its ways and begins to ease aggressively).

The chart also shows the MY ratio back to 1900 against the inflation-adjusted S&P 500 SPX, -1.48% . Alejandra Grindal, Senior International Economist for Ned Davis Research, writes that the MY ratio has had a pretty good track record in the U.S., helping define the beginning and end of some secular bull and bear equity markets. The stock market's 1981 low and the 2000 high are some of the MY ratio's most spectacular successes.

The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.8% in November, surpassing expectations for a 0.5% rise.
The evidence on returns is fairly clear and expected. From 1966 through 2013, we found that the S&P 500 Index returned 15.2% during expansive monetary policy periods (when interest rates were falling) and only 5.9% during restrictive periods (when interest rates were rising). Falling rates have buoyed equity returns. While the magnitude of the return differences may surprise some people, the fact that equities have performed better when rates were trending downward is intuitive.

The BLS does not have an explicit definition for a gig worker, or a formal way of tracking them. It comes closest in a survey called the Contingent Worker Supplement, which studies contingent workers in temporary working arrangements that they don't expect to last more than a year.
As the U.S. population continues to simultaneously grow and gray, and traditional pensions become relics of the past, elderly people living in deprivation will become a progressively greater share of the population. This wave of older poor Americans will strain our social safety net programs, from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to Medicaid. It will devastate federal, state, and local budgets.
A move in this direction would require considerable debate and reflection, but might also confer substantial benefits to the U.S. economy if it could be implemented effectively, Bullard said.
Trump extended his offer, which critics stressed only restored some protections the president had recently taken away by executive order, as the government remained partially shuttered for a 29th day, its funding hung up over border security and other immigration matters.

The piece notes no one has ever been charged with violating the Antideficiency Act.

This is not the first time a reader has suggested giving step-relatives the short shrift when it comes to inheritance. In November, Elsee in Vancouver, Wash., wrote to the Moneyologist to say that her late mother had effectively cut her step grandchildren out of her will before she died by transferring assets beyond the reach of probate, even though her mother's late husband wanted to divide his estate between Elsee and his grandchildren. In this case, she could have kept the lot. But I advised her to divide it.

While playing to those emotions might look like a winning strategy in any given year, sticking with a long-term methodology tends to be the victor for investors who stay with it.
Whatever your methodology, Nasgovitz said, hopefully it helps you handle and weather the extremes of fear and greed, so you don't get excited at the top when everybody else is buying like crazy and, visa versa, you don't get too depressed and sell everything out — and we all know people who have, reacting to the past and perhaps making the bottom, because they are fed up and fearful the world is coming to an end.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.58% , S&P 500 SPX, +0.29% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.40% had a tumultuous 2020, and were lower Friday as investors effectively sold the news of Biden's more generous stimulus proposal, which had been widely anticipated. The market was also dampened by worries over the potential for tax increases and increased risk of more political unrest after last week's siege on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump.
On a different note, even though I expect 2017 to be an up year for stocks, I think it may turn out to be more volatile overall, with bigger swings up and down. Trump is hell-bent on making many rapid and abrupt changes, which are likely to rock share prices. He is also the first president to use his Twitter TWTR, -4.96% account as a major policy tool. There is only so much one can say with a 140-character limit.

The choice to offer a full refund was somewhat unusual on Royal Caribbean's part, as a result. Cruise lines look at this sort of thing on a case by case basis and how disruptive this was to passengers, McDaniel said.

Trump proposed extending for three years protections for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, known as Dreamers, a step that early reports, including by the Wall Street Journal, was seen as a major concession inside the White House. Democrats have advocated for a path to permanent citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, although the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program so far provides temporary protections; it was created by President Obama via executive order after no action in Congress that frustrated the then-president. Pelosi reiterated this desire for permanency on Saturday, as has Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democrat who wrote the BRIDGE legislation that would extend this status.

There is, in short, a gross mistrust in governments and politicians, which means that asking for sacrifices today in exchange for the promise of a better life tomorrow won't pass muster. And this is especially true of trickle down policies: tax cuts for the rich that eventually are supposed to benefit everyone else.
2.Savings are pooled and invested to achieve higher returns. Workers select a guaranteed retirement account, or GRA, pension manager who invests in relatively high-return, well-diversified strategies. People can change managers annually. Pension managers have a fiduciary duty to GRA holders and pro- vide a layer of protection between them and Wall Street.

What does that mean? Here's the key distinction: Marginal tax rates are only applied to part of someone's income, not to all of their earnings. In other words, someone making $10 million would not lose 70% of that money to taxes under Ocasio-Cortez's proposal. A 70% marginal tax rate on earnings above $10 million would only apply to the portion of income above $10 million.
North Dakota and Alaska increased higher education spending by 38% and 6% respectively between 2008 and 2014, according to a report released Thursday by Young Invincibles, a nonprofit millennial advocacy group, which has pushed a platform for debt-free college that includes increased state investment. Every other state cut higher education funding during the same period, the report found. On average, states cut per student spending by 21% during that period.

S&P Global Ratings on Thursday cut Brazil's long-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings by one notch to 'BB-' from 'BB'. The outlook on the ratings is stable. The stable outlook reflects our view that there is a less than one-in-three likelihood that we could raise or lower the ratings on Brazil over the coming year, said credit analyst Lisa Schineller in a statement. It also is indicative of Brazil's stable external position and the strength of its monetary policy that help to offset fiscal weakness and lower economic growth outlook than its peers. BB- is generally viewed as speculative by lenders.

For students born in the early 1980s, each extra year of school pushed their wages up about 7% on average, according to a working paper distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research this week. However, what you do with all that extra time is critical. After researchers stripped out variables such as demographics, whether students had accumulated work experience while in school and other unobservable characteristics, the wage premium went down to just 1%, the study found.

The evidence on returns is fairly clear and expected. From 1966 through 2013, we found that the S&P 500 Index returned 15.2% during expansive monetary policy periods (when interest rates were falling) and only 5.9% during restrictive periods (when interest rates were rising). Falling rates have buoyed equity returns. While the magnitude of the return differences may surprise some people, the fact that equities have performed better when rates were trending downward is intuitive.

Even as the economy recovers, states' level of funding for their higher education institutions hasn't bounced back, the report found. The reasons for the cutbacks (or in two cases, the growth) in spending on colleges and universities vary based on state budget constraints, revenues and other factors. For example, it's likely North Dakota and Alaska were able to boost their higher education spending in part thanks to increased oil revenues, a resource not available in every state, said Tom Allison, the report's author.

More than one-third of the American workforce are freelancers and independent contractors and they're expected to be the majority by 2027, according to the Freelancers Union. But in most states, they have no recourse if they want to take action against a sexual harasser. That's because protections against workplace harassment fall under federal anti-discrimination laws that only cover full-time employees. In April 2018, New York became the latest state to extend sexual harassment protections to freelance workers and contractors.

Still, the shutdown could impact some borrowers trying to manage their debt. Borrowers who want to take advantage of the government's income-driven repayment plans, which allow them to pay off their debt as a percentage of their income, need to show proof of income to their student loan servicer. They also need to recertify their income every year to stay on the plans.

Shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.88% slumped $2.58, or 1.1% in morning trade Tuesday, enough to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% into negative territory, after analyst Keith Horowitz at rival bank Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% turned bearish on Goldman, on the belief that investors may be too optimistic about revenue growth potential. The price decline was shaving 18 points off the Dow, which was down just 7 points. Horowitz downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral, saying the current stock valuation implies revenue growth of 18% off the 2016 base, while the FactSet revenue consensus for 2017 implies 7.6% growth. While we expect [Goldman] to see improved trading revenues going forward, the path is relatively uncertain and the bar is relatively high, Horowitz wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, Horowitz raised his stock price target to $225, which is 6.4% below current levels, from $200. The stock has rocketed 32% since the election, on optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's policy promises to slash regulation and boost fiscal stimulus, which would boost longer-term Treasury yields.

That means if the S&P 500 remains at its Friday close of 2,532 and earnings estimates in 2019 pan out accurately, the index should trade at multiple of 14.6 times earnings in 2019. But if earnings fail to grow altogether, the index would trade at a price-earnings multiple, a popular way of valuing stocks, of 15.6 times earnings in 2019. To be sure, that would mark a substantial drop from around 20 times 12-month trailing earnings at the start of the year.

Marler further suggested consumers avoid everything from sprouts (a notable E. coli outbreak stemming from sprouts sickened roughly 3,000 people in Germany in 2011), raw juices and milk. And consumers should certainly steer clear of under-cooked meat, unpasteurized raw eggs and raw shellfish. And pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems may want to put the fork down where cantaloupe is concerned, since it is a common source of listeria — a 2011 listeria outbreak tied to the melon was responsible for more than 30 deaths.

Helping the youngest workers today understand the importance of securing their long-term financial well-being is an investment that will yield significant benefits. How soon and for how long an individual saves is important because of the power of compound interest. For example, compare a person saving $100 a month starting at age 27 with a person saving the same amount starting at age 37. The first will have contributed just one-third more by age 67, but would accumulate twice as much in savings, assuming a 6% annual rate of return.

The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% , sometimes viewed as a proxy for risk appetite, was trading 0.3% lower at 7,483. That said, the uptrend for stocks remains intact with all three benchmarks looking at a monthly return of more than 7%.

At nine of the 14 colleges studied by the GAO, officials and students had difficulty fully understanding the rules around college student SNAP eligibility. At one school, officials said they believed college students weren't eligible for the program. Officials at three colleges said they would like information from FNS about college student eligibility for SNAP, but that targeted information isn't available.

Trump has said that extending existing border barriers is needed to curb illegal immigration along the southern border and he used Saturday's address to stress immigrant-linked crime accusations, statistics that data agencies have refuted. Trump asked for $800 million each for humanitarian care at the border, which he said targets children and vulnerable travelers brought over to help the status of other adults crossing alongside the minors and $805 million for drug trafficking prevention efforts.
If you have insurance, the best way to find prices is to call your insurance company directly. If you don't, the CDM numbers may be a more accurate representation of what you actually have to pay, but in many cases you can also obtain financial aid from the hospital. Many hospitals will have a patient advocate or price-transparency officer you can speak with to find the exact cost of a procedure before going in to the facility.

The Biden tax plan would: (1) eliminate the $25,000 exemption from the passive loss rules for rental real estate losses incurred by middle-income individuals, (2) eliminate Section 1031 like-kind exchanges that allow deferral of capital gains taxes on swaps of appreciated real property, (3) eliminate rules that allow faster depreciation write-offs for certain real property, and (4) eliminate qualified business income (QBI) deductions for profitable rental real estate activities.
Why is the ECB leaving the QE taps on while inflation and growth [are] showing signs of picking up?

The bottom line is that our colleges — and their students more importantly — are really in many places in a very difficult situation in terms of financing, Baime said.
What is clear is the number of students studying to become teachers is down. More than one-third fewer students enrolled in teacher preparation programs in 2018 than in 2010, according to an analysis published in 2019 by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. In some states, enrollment in these programs dropped more than 50%, the analysis found.

Asian and European stocks rallied, with U.S. oil prices climbing above $50 a barrel, on optimism over trade talks between the U.S. and China. The latest round of talks wrapped up Wednesday, with investors zeroing in on some positive chatter.
Responsible for more than $150 billion in investor money, the hedge-fund manager showed concerns bond investors could be blindsided by an aggressive Federal Reserve willing to ratchet up interest rates as the economy kicks into higher gear.
Increasing interest-rate expectations, as well as Trump's promise to allow U.S. corporations to repatriate foreign earnings free of tax, have helped boost the dollar.
For example, if you were getting paid $11 million at your current job, only the last $1 million would be taxed at 70%, said Mark Mazur, director of the Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. The remainder would be taxed at lower tax rates used for lower incomes.

U.S. Treasury yields rose overnight after early vote counts suggested that Democrats were on track to win both U.S. Senate seats in Georgia and thus control of Congress, an outcome that gives President-elect Joe Biden administration more room to roll out more debt to achieve his policy agendas.
Why people should avoid romaine lettuce (and other foods) anyway
Blitz expects the U.S. and China will reach a lasting truce, the Fed will recalibrate the pace of its balance-sheet runoff and the government, of course, will reopen. What matters is the timing of these developments in determining how quickly markets respond before greater damage is done to the economy, he said.
Analysts are questioning the cost to China's state-owned yet overseas-listed banks, which have once again been called up for national service. The concern is that by acting as a buyer of last resort to prop up the stock market, this sets up China's banks to be the next fault line in the economy.

All in all, market breadth does seem to be slumping a bit, which is often a preamble to weakness in the major averages, and we could start to see traders position themselves for [a] short-term trading top coinciding with the inauguration, Adams said, in a note.
Our first step in this research was to consider which factors might be responsible for movement in the stock market in aggregate. Each firm that is represented in the stock market index produces a stream of revenues. After paying a portion to workers, the rest is left over as profits that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends. The stock price will rise whenever the rewards to the shareholders increase, which can be caused by one of three separate forces:
Rankings can be a strong motivator for younger alumni
Gold has rallied sharply over the past three weeks in what MarketWatch's Mark DeCambre called one of the clearest signs that a rally inspired by President-elect Donald Trump is starting to stall.
That means Saudi Arabia will carry a greater burden of the oil-output cuts in the next two months, as Russia and Kazakhstan are allowed to boost production by a combined 75,000 barrels a day.
If the Fed sticks to its projected rate increases in the face of stable or declining long-term rates, the recession forecast becomes a real possibility. As I explained in my Dec. 23 MarketWatch column, a failure of long rates to cooperate could upend the Fed's best-laid plans. The yield curve could invert this time at exceptionally low levels. And an inverted yield curve, with the benchmark rate higher than the long rate, has been a reliable harbinger of recession.
In April, nearly 12 million low-wage workers were laid off, while some 6 million workers who were earning between $18 to $29 an hour were laid off. By November, all but 400,000 of those workers earning $18 to $29 an hour had returned to work, Raj Chetty, a Harvard economics professor, said. Meanwhile, some 6 million workers who earned less than $13 an hour have yet to return to work.
The Biden tax plan would restart the 12.4% Social Security tax on wages and net SE income above $400,000. This is the so-called donut hole approach to increasing the Social Security tax. Over the years, the donut hole would gradually close as the lower edge of the hole is adjusted upward for inflation while the $400,000 upper edge of the hole remains static.
Wielding influence in Europe is not yet a lost cause. There is respect in Europe for Britain for its past contributions; for its commitment to democracy; for its understanding of, and place in, world markets; for the competence of its military.

The Gephardt Rule has tended to result in automatic increases to the debt ceiling and less attention for that issue, but it doesn't always deliver.
The majority on the Fed believes that domestic demand in the U.S. economy is strong enough now to power through global weakness. At the December meeting, when the Fed raised interest rates from the near-zero level that had existed since late 2008, officials said downside risks from global economic and financial developments had diminished since late summer, according to minutes of the meeting released Wednesday.
Despite the European Central Bank not changing its outlook or interest rates, the euro soared during today's lunchtime press conference. The market had expected Mario Draghi to come out and temper expectations by talking down the recent euro appreciation, as he has done in the past. However, he stated that the economy was vastly improving and the recovery was now 'robust and broad-based', which is far more positive language than he used last year, said Hamish Muress, currency analyst at OFX, in a note.

There will need to be a significant increase in core inflation and wages before the ECB would consider a further, faster or earlier reduction of QE, said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist, at ING in a note. In our view, even a hint at 2018 tapering will not come before the summer, after the Dutch and French elections and the first possible impact of new U.S. economic policies.
Opponents are optimistic that President-elect Biden's incoming administration could stop the rule from taking effect and eventually rescind it. Biden has expressed support for different criteria for determining worker classification, the so-called ABC test, which is law in California but not for gig companies, which successfully backed a ballot measure to exempt them from the law in November.
Most European benchmark were stuck in the red while the euro headed toward $1.2300, a level that hasn't been seen since December 2014, according to FactSet data. A stronger euro can make products produced by European exporters more expensive for their overseas customers to purchase.
J.P. Morgan & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon said he isn't concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies will hurt the economy by pushing for tariffs and adopting a protectionist stance. During a call with reporters on Friday following the bank's quarterly results, Dimon said despite Trump's rhetoric and frequent use of Twitter, which indicate the real-estate mogul would retool trade agreements with Mexico and hold a hard line with countries like China, he expects the coming president's administration to do the right thing. Putting aside the one-liners and election rhetoric, I am comforted by the fact that he's putting real players on the playing field, Dimon said. Trump, for example, has repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency and has threatened to place tariffs on its goods. Critics fear that such a tacked would backfire as China would likely retaliate with tariffs of its own. The U.S. is the biggest market for China, accepting about a fifth of its exports. Shares of J.P. Morgan JPM, +1.65% were up nearly 2% on Friday, following its better-than-expected results, which were giving a lift to financials XLF, +0.52% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% . Give him some time, Dimon said of Trump. The J.P.

The Biden plan would create a new refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 for eligible first-time homebuyers. The credit could be collected when a home is purchased, rather than later at tax-return filing time. Biden would also establish a new refundable tax credit for low-income renters. The credit would be intended to hold rent and utility payments to 30% of monthly income.
On top of that, a wave of Treasury issuance could swamp bond investors. The Fed's reduction of its balance sheet and the deficit-widening tax cuts could ramp up the federal government's borrowing needs.

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (Project Syndicate) — Speculative markets have always been vulnerable to illusion. But seeing the folly in markets provides no clear advantage in forecasting outcomes, because changes in the force of the illusion are difficult to predict.

Of course, in addition to a wage gap within occupations, there is also a wage gap between occupations. Previous Institute for Women's Policy Research analysis has found that more than one in four employed women in the U.S. are concentrated in low-wage service work, such as teaching young children, cleaning, serving, and caring for elders. Workers in these majority-female jobs are also disproportionately women of color, Hegewisch said.
So, now the labor market discussion will move on to a) how far is the unemployment rate going to shoot past its long-run equilibrium and b) how quickly are wages accelerating, he said in a research note.
Indeed, women accounted for 18% of chief executive officer replacements in 2017, unchanged from the year before, according to recent data from global outplacement consultancy firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

U.S. stocks ended the day with substantial losses Wednesday. A combination of plunging crude-oil prices CLG26, +0.10% and hand-wringing over China's sluggish economy and fears about North Korea's nuclear capabilities unsettled investors. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve meeting minutes, released at 2 p.m. Eastern Time, showed some policy makers had reservations about raising interest rates. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.37% closed 26.39 points, or 1.31%, lower at 1,990. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.38% fell 251.8 points, or 1.47%, to 16,906. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.27% ended the day down 55.67 points, or 1.14%, at 4,835.

On Thursday evening, President-elect Joe Biden said he will call for $1,400 stimulus checks and more vaccine funds in a $1.9-trillion coronavirus economic relief package when he takes office this month. One note of caution: Analysts say that after the proposal is debated in Congress, the final COVID-19 rescue package is unlikely to be as generous as currently proposed.

There are four federal funds rate increases expected by the market in 2018, for about 100 basis points in tightening by the Federal Reserve. If the federal funds rate were to rise by 100 basis points from 1.5% at present to 2.5%, then the two-year Treasury note yield would be at 3% or higher, as historically the correlation between the two has been very close. That means that if the 10-year Treasury yield stays below 3% — and that is the $4.4 trillion question — then the yield curve would likely invert in 2018.
Also kicking off Monday trade was news that Carillion CLLN, -28.95% will enter liquidation after crisis talks failed over the weekend. The construction giant, which also runs public services at prisons, hospitals and schools, couldn't work out a deal with the government and its creditors. Carillion employs 20,000 in the U.K. and uses thousands of subcontractors. Its shares have been halted.

Wilson said if bitcoin breaks below $10,000, then it could retest the January 17 low of $9,200, and from there, $8,000 would be the next level that could be taken out. Going the other way, he said if it can move above $12,000, then the next level of resistance is $13,200.

To be sure, I'm focusing on the economy as a whole, which doesn't mean that every individual's retirement prospects are brightening.

Treasury yields declined on Wednesday as details about President-elect Donald Trump's fiscal policy proposals weren't forthcoming at the President-elect's first news conference since the election. Instead, Trump addressed recent allegations that his campaign staff had been in contact with the Russian government, and that Russia's spy agencies had compromising information on the president-elect. A Trump lawyer also focused on how Trump would handle several conflicts of interest related to his business holdings. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note [s:TMUBMUSD10Y] fell two basis points to 3.658%, while the two-year yield [s:TMUBMUSD02Y] fell 1.4 basis point to 1.179%. The 30-year yield [s:TMUBMUSD30Y] fell two basis points to 2.948%.
While we don't know the full extent to which loan repayment policies will change, it's possible that everything from income-driven repayment to full on debt cancellation is in play.

Furthermore, it's worth adding, even with the Fed's boost the stock market this century has been a well-below-average performer. Consider the inflation-adjusted return of various stock market averages from their early-2000 highs to the end of 2016, which is when the MY ratio hit bottom: The S&P 500 produced just a 0.1% annualized real return over that period, while the Nasdaq COMP, -3.02% produced an annualized 0.7% loss.

My answer is: most likely. Corrections can happen at any time, but to get a real bear market we need a recession, and no recession is in sight for the U.S. economy in 2017. A recession may very well happen during the first term of the Trump presidency, since the present economic expansion will be eight years long (or 96 months) this June. After that point, there would have been only two expansions longer than 96 months: March 1991 to March 2001 (120 months) and February 1961 to December 1969 (106 months; please see this table).
By his group's estimations, removing the tip credit would require restaurants to increase hourly wages of servers by 220% as long as they still received the standard tip rate of 20% from most customers — an unsustainable amount of pay for restaurants. This rise in wages for servers has led to more restaurants closing and fewer jobs for people in the service industry, Chaisson argues.
The big lie is that it will lead to restaurants sharing these tips with back of house, said Shierholz, senior economist and director policy at the Economic Policy Institute. Instead, she said employers will be able to control tips and take a big chunk of them as long as they pay the minimum wage. The proposal would require staff to make minimum wage, but allow tips to be pooled beyond that. (A spokesman for the Department of Labor said it intends to publish an informed cost benefit analysis as part of any final rule.)

Corporate debt was another horizontal cloud mentioned by the Bogle.
J.P. Morgan & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon said he isn't concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's trade policies will hurt the economy by pushing for tariffs and adopting a protectionist stance. During a call with reporters on Friday following the bank's quarterly results, Dimon said despite Trump's rhetoric and frequent use of Twitter, which indicate the real-estate mogul would retool trade agreements with Mexico and hold a hard line with countries like China, he expects the coming president's administration to do the right thing. Putting aside the one-liners and election rhetoric, I am comforted by the fact that he's putting real players on the playing field, Dimon said. Trump, for example, has repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency and has threatened to place tariffs on its goods. Critics fear that such a tacked would backfire as China would likely retaliate with tariffs of its own. The U.S. is the biggest market for China, accepting about a fifth of its exports. Shares of J.P. Morgan JPM, +1.65% were up nearly 2% on Friday, following its better-than-expected results, which were giving a lift to financials XLF, +0.52% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% . Give him some time, Dimon said of Trump. The J.P.

However, that still leaves a chunky deterioration in underlying growth momentum, not in Germany, but possibly globally, they said. After stripping out one-time factors, the economists found the slowdown in German output remained slightly below, but within its usual range, around the signal coming from global momentum, which has weakened and suggests growth very close to zero.

But Connecticut's approach to the problem is one of the most comprehensive of any state, said Maggie Thompson, the campaign manager of CAP initiative Higher Ed, Not Debt and one of the authors of the report. Connecticut's legislation includes three main components: The creation of a borrower education and information course so families can have a better sense of their obligations before they take on a loan, an ombudsman — paid for by fees levied on servicers — to help track and field complaints about the loan repayment process, and a requirement that servicers handling Connecticut borrowers' loans be licensed by the state's banking department to ensure they live up to basic consumer protections.

WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) - The market's expectation that the Federal Reserve will only raise interest rates twice in 2016 are too low, said Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer on Wednesday. We think they're too low, Fischer said in an interview with CNBC. The Fed's own forecast in its dot plot' are for four rate hikes this year. Fischer said this was more in the ballpark. He added that policy is not on automatic pilot. We don't know enough now to know how many [rate hikes] there will be, Fischer said, because the Fed will have to respond to events.

The Fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.
The pandemic and recession were associated with a 10% to 60% increase in deaths of despair above already high pre-pandemic levels, according to a working paper by Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago.

The one bright spot from the bloodletting at the end of 2018 is that expectations have been diminished, leading Wall Street to expect slower revenue and earnings growth.

As was the case last quarter, all companies will likely be judged more on their outlook than their past results, as investors try to get a handle on where the tech boom will go from here.

The first round of quarterly earnings every year is normally an exuberant time for tech companies, which get to show off how many devices they put under Christmas trees, how many ads for those goodies they sold, or services that will be enjoyed on the new iPhones, PCs and more.

But Connecticut's approach to the problem is one of the most comprehensive of any state, said Maggie Thompson, the campaign manager of CAP initiative Higher Ed, Not Debt and one of the authors of the report. Connecticut's legislation includes three main components: The creation of a borrower education and information course so families can have a better sense of their obligations before they take on a loan, an ombudsman — paid for by fees levied on servicers — to help track and field complaints about the loan repayment process, and a requirement that servicers handling Connecticut borrowers' loans be licensed by the state's banking department to ensure they live up to basic consumer protections.

Inadequate savings is only one problem with relying on the stock market to fund our retirements. A far greater problem with relying on 401(k)s is that the stock market is extremely volatile.

It is true that adjustments in the overnight rate, up or down, generally drive long-term interest rates in the same direction. But not always. Long-term rates have other priorities to consider, including the path of the overnight rate going forward, inflation expectations, and the perceived risk of holding a 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 1.710% versus rolling over a short-term T-bill TMUBMUSD03M, 0.012% .

Gold futures held onto their gains in electronic trading late Wednesday after settling at a more than three-week high. Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's December meeting revealed that officials from the central bank saw the possibility that they might have to raise interest rates faster than the gradual pace that they have stressed for some time. Higher interest rates can be a negative for gold, which tends to benefit from looser monetary policy, but the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.41% extended its decline after the minutes, offering dollar-denominated gold some support. February gold gcg7 was at $1,165.90 an ounce in electronic trading. It had settled at $1,165.30 an ounce, up $3.30, or 0.3%, for the session.

The dollar was whacked lower as the market reacted to the weaker-than-expected jobs report. The U.S. added only 148,000 jobs in December, compared with the MarketWatch consensus forecast of 195,000. Wages grew by 2.5% in the 12 months leading up to December, compared with 2.4% in the previous month. Wages are also used as a gauge for inflation, which has been stubbornly low.

President-elect Donald Trump has already hinted at some aggressive trade tariffs, for example threatening Japanese car maker Toyota 7203, +4.12% with a big border tax if it builds a plant in Mexico for cars to the U.S. market. In the same vein, Ford F, -1.58% in a surprising turnaround last week said it's canceled plans for a $1.6 billion Mexico plant after facing criticism from Trump for more than a year.
Still, some market observers cautioned against reading too much into the oil market's rebound.
Nonetheless, this was the first time Trump named Japan as benefiting from a trade imbalance with the U.S., raising some concern among investors in the Asian country, and contributing to a 1.2% slump in the Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +1.01% on Thursday.
Economists also appear to be taking the idea of student-debt cancellation more seriously, which could provide some intellectual backing to candidates interested in campaigning on the issue. A study released last year by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in Annandale-On-Hudson, N.Y. found that wiping out the nation's student debt could have a positive impact on the economy.
The government's unemployment rate hovered at 6.7% in December, and the number of unemployed workers was 10.7 million. However, the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank, argues that a breakdown of government figures and other estimates based on those paint a far bleaker picture due to the business closures and public-health restrictions related to COVID-19: 26.8 million workers are being negatively affected — or nearly 16% of the workforce.
15. Take a home inventory. Take out that smartphone and photograph EVERYTHING in your house, garage, attic, etc. Open up drawers. Take photos of closet contents. Take close-ups. Then save all of these photos to a flash drive, and put the flash drive in a safe-deposit box (or have a relative who resides somewhere else) hold it. In the event of fire, flood or other natural disaster, having such pictures really helps to secure a greater settlement with the insurance company over personal property items.
Furthermore, it's worth adding, even with the Fed's boost the stock market this century has been a well-below-average performer. Consider the inflation-adjusted return of various stock market averages from their early-2000 highs to the end of 2016, which is when the MY ratio hit bottom: The S&P 500 produced just a 0.1% annualized real return over that period, while the Nasdaq COMP, -3.02% produced an annualized 0.7% loss. The two-century average inflation-adjusted return for equities, according to the Wharton School's Jeremy Siegel, is between 6% and 7% annualized.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday jumped to a fresh peak as a trio of bankers, headlined by current Chairman Jerome Powell, underscored the health of the U.S. economy but also expressed an attentiveness to a market that has grown fragile amid a spate of interest-rate increases. The Dow DJIA, -0.39% was up 616 points, or 2.7%, at 23,291, the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.16% climbed 2.8% at 2,515, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.09% advanced 3.2%, producing the best intraday gains, to reach 6,671. The moves follow a better-than-expected job report that showed that 312,000 jobs were created in December, with the unemployment rate rising to 3.9%, as more workers entered the workforce. Against that backdrop, Powell, during an panel discussion featuring former Fed bosses, Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at an event in Atlanta, said the employment report underlined the economy's health. He also said that the central bank would be willing to adjust policy if it disrupted the market or created adverse financial conditions, running against the central bank's statutory goals. The Fed has raised interest rates nine times since the end of 2015.

That's a problem because the gig economy matters. All that missing data could help economists understand the state of our economy and the changing nature of the workforce, and — in a climate of stagnant wage growth — shed more light on how much money people earn.

If earnings climb, stocks usually go up too, even though this situation is never a linear relationship.

And, let's not kid ourselves. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department didn't just bail out shadow banks. As a result of an amendment that I offered to audit the emergency lending activities of the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis, we learned that the Fed provided more than $16 trillion in short-term, low-interest loans to every major financial institution in the country including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, not to mention large corporations, foreign banks, and foreign central banks throughout the world.

I don't believe the Trump administration is going to be supportive of a strong dollar, said Brien Lundin, editor of Gold Newsletter. In fact, it seems the opposite will be true…This will be bullish for gold, as will the fact that real interest rates will remain low or negative for some time to come.

Assets themselves are more sensitive, a 1% rise in bond yields will produce the largest bear market in bonds since the 1980-1981 period, said Dalio. At the turn of the 1980s, a rare combination of high unemployment and inflation stalked the devastated U.S. economy, driving the 10-year yield to a record high of 15.68% in October 1981.
And skeptics question whether the perceived positives are as bullish as investors assume.

Oil prices fell 45% in 2014 and another 16% in 2015—on a combination of increasing production and oversupply, waning demand from China and a strengthening dollar. Over the first six trading session of the new year, crude prices fell another 15% to below $32 a barrel. Morgan Stanley joined other banks forecasting oil to fall to $20 a barrel as the dollar is likely to rise due to tighter monetary policy.

MarketWatch: There has been a lot of discussion in recent weeks about a new framework for monetary policy. Where do you stand?
The Fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. A Google Ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. The idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. Lawrence Summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.

The overnight rate has a definite, albeit unquantifiable, effect on financial-asset prices, economic activity (via its influence on aggregate demand) and ultimately inflation. And while monetary policy is more potent than fiscal policy, the impact of any given change in the funds rate and, hence, the money supply varies from business cycle to business cycle. Which is why even the best monetary rule argues for a bit of discretion in its implementation.
The monthly premium for the current year depends on your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI), as reported on your Form 1040 for two years earlier. Strange but true. For example, your 2019 premiums depend on your 2017 MAGI. MAGI means the adjusted gross income (AGI) amount shown on page 1 of your Form 1040 plus any tax-exempt interest income.

Apple Inc. AAPL, +1.27% shares rebounded, rising 3.9%, following Thursday's 9.9% decline spurred by the company cutting its revenue guidance, citing weaker iPhone sales in China.
The problem for policy makers is outflows are hard to control, as it let so much foreign capital in during the good times when the policy-driven yuan pegged to the greenback was a safe-haven.

So far at least China's offshore bond markets have proved resilient despite equity falls, which would be an indicator of greater unease.

Meanwhile, home-builder stocks lost ground after a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors survey found U.K. house-price growth slowed in December, for the first time since July.
Like last year, though, we doubt that this latest bout of renminbi strength will continue for much longer. After all, the recent rally in the dollar means that the renminbi has appreciated in trade-weighted terms. And with the euro EURUSD, -0.03% and yen USDJPY, +0.03% likely to weaken against the dollar during the course of this year on account of diverging monetary policies in Europe and Japan relative to that in the US, the renminbi would need to weaken against the dollar just to simply tread water in trade-weighted terms. Indeed, given that we forecast the euro to weaken to $0.95/€ and the yen to head towards ¥130/$, the renminbi would need to depreciate to around 7.3/$, from 6.89/$ currently, in order to hold its ground in trade-weighted terms (see chart below).

Yields have been in a steady uptrend over the past six months, ever since the 10-year touched an all-time low around 1.36% in July, though the move accelerated after the November election of Trump, whose policies, include ramping up fiscal spending, are expected to stoke inflation. Rising inflation erodes the value of a bond's fixed payments. Typically, when inflation is on the rise, bond investors demand higher yields to compensate for the corrosive effect that higher prices have on real returns.
For instance, raising the Fed's inflation target above 2%, an idea proposed by Olivier Blanchard, the former IMF chief economist, may lead to higher swings in inflation, which could have damaging consequences for the economy, Fischer said.

The economy has improved broadly and for young people specifically, but recent college graduates still face challenges. Young people who graduated college in 2017 faced an underemployment rate of 11.9%, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank focused on labor issues. That's up from 9.6% in 2007 and 7.1% in 2000. Workers are typically defined as unemployed if they're unwillingly working part-time or in a job that they're overqualified for.
In his speech over the weekend to the AEA's annual conference in Atlanta, Blanchard argued that in the new-low-inflation environment, the real interest rate will remain lower than a countries growth rate.

To make matters more complicated, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer left in October for personal reasons (most likely because he realized he had no chance of ever becoming Fed chairman). Janet Yellen did not get nominated for a second term, and the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William Dudley, is retiring this year. That means the top three people at the Fed are leaving more or less at the same time, just as the Fed is getting ready to unwind its $4.4 trillion balance sheet (see chart).

Taking a cue from market sectors, the Nasdaq 100 NDX, -3.13% made an all-time high last week (see chart). This suggests that investors' appetite for risk is alive and well. This time the move in the Nasdaq 100 is very different than the move that culminated in the technology bust of 2000, as today it is driven by earnings. While the technology sector did initially underperform when the Trumpnado hit the stock market right after the election (denoted in the dip at the end in the relative chart here), that appears to have ended as the relative action of the Nasdaq 100 compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% has now turned up.

Don't miss:Here's why the U.S. dollar could soar by another 30%
There are good reasons for today's disgruntlement: four decades of promises by political leaders of both the center-left and center-right, espousing the neoliberal faith that globalization, financialization, deregulation, privatization, and a host of related reforms would bring unprecedented prosperity, have gone unfulfilled.
There is also a lower average education among the obese — studies show that individuals who are obese are more likely to have lower levels of educational attainment — which may also explain part of the reason why they are less likely to invest in the stock market.
U.S. stocks closed lower Friday, snapping a five-day streak that helped to drive the Dow and the S&P 500 out of correction territory.

Many of the people doing the in-person work for Clear Capital are real-estate agents and brokers, Chen said.
Ratings for emerging market corporate debt are seeing an uptick Fitch Ratings
The current spread between the effective funds rate and 10-year Treasury is about 30 basis points. Historically, a spread that narrow has been either a precursor to inversion (the Fed ignores the signal and keeps raising rates) or the start of a capitulation (the Fed realizes the error of its ways and begins to ease aggressively).

Nearly two million students may be walking around college campuses hungry and aren't getting access to the resources to which they're entitled.
This time around, there has been such intense focus on the curve, both instructive (Fed research on the powerful signal inherent in the term structure) and frivolous (market chatter that attaches some importance to a short-lived inversion between, say, 3- and 5-year notes), that the Fed may be more circumspect about tapping the brakes if the next adjustment in interest rates is certain to push the funds rate above the yield on the 10-year Treasury.
Krawcheck wants Ellevest, which has secured $19 million in funding, to become the go-to place for investment advice for women. She hopes to do that in part by distinguishing Ellevest from what she thinks is a mistaken stereotype of the robo adviser. I've never been a fan of the term, she said.
Rising college costs also mean that these recent graduates who may not be working in a job that uses their degree are likely faced with student loans. About 44 million Americans are coping with $1.4 trillion in student debt.
That's not always, or even mostly, the case. Stock-market turbulence, both in the U.S. and China, is widely thought to have been the main reason why the Fed didn't raise interest rates this September, for instance. Traders have long speculated about a Greenspan, and then a Bernanke, and then a Yellen, put, referring to the option designed to protect investors from losses. The notion is that when stock markets get rough, Fed officials will rush to the rescue.

Students set foot on a college campus often the hope that their education will help them climb the economic ladder and sustain themselves and their families.
Rosengren: The [Fed forecasts] in December had three tightenings. I actually think we'll probably need a little bit more than that. I'm hopeful that we can continue to do it gradually. Doing it gradually probably requires us to continue to be doing it though. So if we were to slow down for some reason, I would be worried that at some point we would have to start moving more quickly. I would be worried about moving quickly at a time when asset prices were already at very high valuations. I think being able to do it more leisurely is one reason why we haven't had as much of a slowdown and probably has reduced the probability of having a recession. In addition, fiscal policy being so stimulative is a period where you wouldn't expect an economic downturn either.
The ECB has adopted an aggressive easing program and negative deposit rate to try to get inflation back to a target of around 2%.

You are approaching the distribution season of your cycle. There is a psychological shift that takes place when you are no longer working for the money that comes into your life.
Rosengren: No, I wouldn't phrase it that way. Our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. The unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. My own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. If you look at the Blue Chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. So we are actually moving in the opposite direction. I do think that we have to gradually tighten and I don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.
Yet, all of her work and the work of other so-called side hustlers or gig workers who typically take on multiple jobs, is essentially invisible in the eyes of the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics.

Last year, President-elect Joe Biden proposed creating more stringent standards for housing appraisals to ensure that professionals in the field do not hold implicit bias that influence their work.

In 1980, Congress passed legislation to require credit unions to cap interest rates on their loans at no more than 15 percent. And, that law has worked well.

The Justice Department on Tuesday said it's filed an appeal against a case brought by the state of California, and is seeking a direct review in the U.S. Supreme Court, after a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security's decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. It defies both law and common sense for DACA-an entirely discretionary non-enforcement policy that was implemented unilaterally by the last administration after Congress rejected similar legislative proposals and courts invalidated the similar DAPA policy-to somehow be mandated nationwide by a single district court in San Francisco, said Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in a statement.

The study adds to the body of research and debate surrounding the merits of working while in school. There's evidence to indicate that college students who work about 15 to 20 hours a week do better in school, but that working more than 20 hours a week can put students in danger of taking longer to finish college or not completing at all. The latest study shows that on average, working while in school may also help students earn more money after they leave.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the U.S. central bank can now be patient about further monetary policy and wait to see how conflicting signals from the market and the economy resolve themselves. In a conversation at the American Economics Association meeting in Atlanta, Powell said the central bank was open to changing course on rate hikes and reducing its balance sheet depending on how the economy evolves. In a brief opening remarks, Powell pushed back on the market's DJIA, -0.39% pessimism about the outlook, saying most of the hard data remain quite solid and suggest ongoing momentum going into 2019.

10. Other than keeping fees (and there are many hidden fees in investment products) and costs low, the next most important decision relates to strategic asset allocation—i.e., what is the target allocation to various asset classes (U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, fixed income investments, etc.) over the long term. Many retirees have investment portfolios that are either too aggressive or too conservative. And most risk tolerance questionnaires lack true insight into how much investment risk you NEED to take on, as opposed to how much risk you can tolerate. Developing a strategic asset allocation, as part of an overall investment policy, is an area that a fee-only, expert financial planner/investment adviser can help a retiree with.

We were going to meet and start talking about strategies for encouraging people to go into the teaching profession, Larson said. Those tactics include fostering interest in teaching as a second career or creating an affordable path to a teaching license for professionals with an aptitude for teaching.

It's not that the Fed is here to save the markets from volatility,' he added. But the magnitude of the pullback we've had, around 20%, tells you something about what the market believes about the underlying economy. It would be the height of hubris for Powell to disregard that, and markets are taking solace in Powell's suggestion that monitoring large swings in equity valuations are important part of data dependence, Chiavarone said.

And it matters even more to the U.K., with its particularly large financial services sector.

I would have felt a lot better if the people that grew this enormous balance sheet were there when the unwinding process got going in earnest. This is because of a concern that Powell, then a Fed governor, voiced in 2012, which was on my mind throughout this whole quantitative-easing business. Powell was quoted by ZeroHedge last week (from the transcripts of the Oct. 23-24, 2012, FOMC meeting):
Ahead of the Fed meeting, many economists thought the Fed would decide to concentrate more on the longer-end of the yield curve, but the actual support for the support for the move in the meeting was small.

It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don't vote. They don't believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don't think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.

People may have reason to care less about the recent stock-market volatility, but perhaps for all the wrong reasons. Just over half of Americans own stocks, a Gallup report recently concluded. That includes 401(k) plans, shares in an equity mutual fund and/or an IRA account. Worse, two-thirds of Americans do not even participate in or have access to a 401(k) plan, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In other words, they simply don't have a vested interest.
But the risk here is that it can be difficult to maintain control when expectations build that the currency is set on a depreciation path. This can lead to a snowball effect with capital outflows, says Daiwa.

A sustained rise in global inflation is likely only if there is a widespread shift to expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, said Kenningham. For now, there are few signs that policy makers outside the U.S. will unveil a major fiscal stimulus or that central banks will resort to more radical options…The upshot is that for much of the world, there is still a greater risk of inflation being too low than too high.

Millennials have a lower level of financial literacy than older workers. Many of the most important financial decisions, including investing in higher education, saving for retirement, and purchasing a home, are made early in adult life. Addressing common budget challenges young workers might face such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and credit card debt, could help them save for retirement. For example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. While it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan. Providing opportunities to focus on the bigger picture of financial wellness can help workers better navigate these competing financial demands while encouraging planning and budgeting for unexpected expenses.

The mechanical technical recommendations continue to sour quickly as momentum remains frustratingly unsustainable; our advice (remember we have over nine years of following this strategy and can recognize when it makes recommendations that are at that point in the cycle unlikely to be wise advice) is still to hold 100% in cash.

Trump has left it to states to administer the vaccine program — tweeting that it was up to the states to administer and then calling some states very slow — meaning that stressed state health departments, which have already had to deal with testing, contact tracing, public information campaigns and deciding when or whether schools or businesses should be open or closed, are now tasked with handling the biggest public health effort in decades.

12. I urge retirees to use caution when purchasing fixed annuities, and another newer type of (fixed) annuity—the longevity annuity. If interest rates do, in fact, increase, then better annuitization rates will likely appear, resulting in greater payouts from the annuities. While fixed annuities have a place to play for some retirees, purchasing one should likely be done with the aid of a fee-only adviser who possesses expertise in evaluating the strength of the life insurance company, the vitality of the state insurance guarantee fund which might be available in case of insurance company default, whether to structure the annuity with a CPI (inflation) rider or equivalent, whether to ladder fixed annuities over time, and to secure the better rates through shopping for no-load or low-load annuities.

Here's the plan. If your total itemizable deductions for 2020 will be close to your standard deduction amount, consider making enough additional expenditures for itemized deduction items before year-end to exceed the standard deduction. Those prepayments will lower this year's tax bill. Next year, your standard deduction might be a bit bigger thanks to an inflation adjustment, and you can claim it then. Or it could be smaller, if major tax-increase legislation passes, which I think is unlikely.
Talk of 'global reflation' seems wide of the mark, said Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist with Capital Economics.
Another factor: Because the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act greatly increased the standard deduction amounts for 2018-2025, fewer individuals will be itemizing. But having significant medical expenses (including those for Medicare health insurance premiums) may allow you to itemize and collect some tax savings.
