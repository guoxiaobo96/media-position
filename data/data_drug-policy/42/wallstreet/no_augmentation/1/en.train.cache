rosengren: i think there are some advantages of having a fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. my own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. i would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. and that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that i would actually like a higher level of inflation so i would like to be higher in the range during that period. and during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. and the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. and i do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and i also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. so i would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so i think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.
the fed knows it will probably revisit the zero lower bound sometime in the future and it is a matter of prudent planning to shore up their tool kit now, said julia coronado, president of macropolicy perspectives.

1) chinese policy makers have enacted a shift in recent days. over the first four trading days of the year, beijing allowed the yuan to weaken 0.8%, which is the largest slide over such a period since august, according to goldman. that was back when the authorities first started to devalue the currency and triggered a global market selloff.
it isn't surprising to me that we're tightening up at the short-end but the fact that monetary policy both here and abroad has been pushing down on the long rate means that this is going to be a little bit different exit strategy than what we've historically seen. we haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. people who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, i think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that europe, japan and the united states have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. so the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly i can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. i'm not advocating that. but i think it is an intentional policy. it is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.

there are four federal funds rate increases expected by the market in 2018, for about 100 basis points in tightening by the federal reserve. if the federal funds rate were to rise by 100 basis points from 1.5% at present to 2.5%, then the two-year treasury note yield would be at 3% or higher, as historically the correlation between the two has been very close. that means that if the 10-year treasury yield stays below 3% — and that is the $4.4 trillion question — then the yield curve would likely invert in 2018.

fear is on the rise. wall street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the cboe volatility index vix, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since nov. 3, 2016, according to factset data. the spike comes as the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% , the s&p 500 index spx, -1.48% and the nasdaq composite index comp, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. the dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since october. the pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by president-elect donald trump, which include looser regulations on wall street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost u.s. economic growth. however, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at trump's news conference on wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. the vix is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the s&p 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. still, current levels of the vix at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.

the other is a naturally occurring illusion: the proximity of dow 20,000. the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.46% has been above 19,000 since november, and countless news stories have focused on its flirtation with the 20,000 barrier, which might be crossed by the time this commentary is published. whatever happens, dow 20,000 will still have a psychological impact on markets.

rosengren: no, i wouldn't phrase it that way. our dual mandate goal would be that we have to get to 2% inflation and get to what we believe is a sustainable unemployment rate. the unemployment rate right now is at 4.1% so we're already lower than where we think we need to be. my own view is what the sustainable unemployment rate would be more like 4.7%. if you look at the blue chip forecasts, which just came out, they are actually getting it down to 3.7% in 2019. so we are actually moving in the opposite direction. i do think that we have to gradually tighten and i don't want to overshoot on the unemployment rate so much that it becomes very difficult to get back to a sustainable unemployment rate without having a recession.

we cannot educate people out of this crisis. given the reality on the ground, the most sophisticated among us would be hard-pressed to master the complex machinery of personal finance. yet instead of focusing on reforms to fix our train wreck of a retirement system, our policy makers are distracted by campaigns for partial stopgap measures. as lawmakers grapple with payday loans and usurious credit card interest rates, retirement security goes by the boards. the world economic forum (wef) estimates that the united states had a $28 trillion retirement savings gap in 2015—the largest in the world. by 2050, they project this will grow to $137 trillion. this is almost a $3 trillion annual increase—five times the annual u.s. defense budget.

the overnight rate has a definite, albeit unquantifiable, effect on financial-asset prices, economic activity (via its influence on aggregate demand) and ultimately inflation. and while monetary policy is more potent than fiscal policy, the impact of any given change in the funds rate and, hence, the money supply varies from business cycle to business cycle. which is why even the best monetary rule argues for a bit of discretion in its implementation.

to switch from a tax-deferred retirement savings accounts to a potentially tax-free roth ira savings account. waiting to do so will only require that you pay higher income taxes in the future on hopefully additional savings (you can't believe federal income tax rates will fall); they will most likely rise, and you can manage the state income tax bill on your tax-deferred savings by relocating, if appropriate, as soon as possible, then converting. if that involves a change of employer, you have an ideal opportunity to convert all of your 401(k) and/or 403b balances to roth accounts at the time.

allow me to put your credit-card debt into perspective. a $7,000 credit balance with an 18% annual rate, with a minimum payment of 2% of the balance, or $10, whichever is greater, would take 188 months or just nearly 16 years to pay off. making minimum payments on your credit card is a long road to nowhere, and making no payments will lead to debt collectors and more stress.

china on monday announced its economy expanded by 6.6% over a year earlier, down from 2017's 6.9%. growth in the three months ending in december cooled to 6.4% from the previous quarter's 6.5%. china's communist leaders are trying to steer china to slower, more self-sustaining growth based on consumer spending instead of trade and investment. but the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting beijing to ease lending controls and step up government spending to shore up growth and avoid politically dangerous job losses. the lackluster data raised hopes for more policy action.
the choice to offer a full refund was somewhat unusual on royal caribbean's part, as a result. cruise lines look at this sort of thing on a case by case basis and how disruptive this was to passengers, mcdaniel said. given that oasis of the seas had to skip two ports of call and return a day early, mcdaniel said it was abundantly clear to royal caribbean that the illness outbreak adversely affected passengers' experience even if they weren't sick.
the biden tax plan would increase the maximum refundable child credit to $4,000 for one qualifying child or $8,000 for two or more qualifying children. families making between $125,000 and $400,000 would receive reduced credits. apparently, the same rules would apply to an enhanced credit for expenses to care for qualifying dependents.

millennials have a lower level of financial literacy than older workers. many of the most important financial decisions, including investing in higher education, saving for retirement, and purchasing a home, are made early in adult life. addressing common budget challenges young workers might face such as paying off student loans, mortgages, and credit card debt, could help them save for retirement. for example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. while it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan. providing opportunities to focus on the bigger picture of financial wellness can help workers better navigate these competing financial demands while encouraging planning and budgeting for unexpected expenses.

most democrats say extending the wall is an ineffective and expensive measure, stressing that most alleged immigration policy abuse comes from immigrants who overstay their legal permissions. some have pointed to the vulnerabilities of a wall without boosting security technology or manpower; others argue that trump is clinging to a vanity campaign promise whose funding plans have shifted. the white house's plan was seen as particularly vulnerable in a now democrat-controlled house.

we've clawed back from the december downturn, which was disconnected from economic reality, he said. with inflation not rising convincingly above 2%, markets are right to think that the fed will be their friend, he said, adding that friday's subdued inflation reading will give the central bank even more reason to take the patient approach powell has outlined in recent speeches.

the study adds to the body of research and debate surrounding the merits of working while in school. there's evidence to indicate that college students who work about 15 to 20 hours a week do better in school, but that working more than 20 hours a week can put students in danger of taking longer to finish college or not completing at all. the latest study shows that on average, working while in school may also help students earn more money after they leave.

this strategy also coincides with a long-established tendency of republican party leadership, since the 1970s, to run up federal budget deficits when they are in power and then return to fiscal conservatism when the democrats take office. and finally, there are also some true believers in high republican places; mitch mcconnell used some of these in the senate to tell trump no can do just before the election, when trump leaned on republican senators to reach a deal with the democrats on the heroes 2.0 covid stimulus bill. trump backed off, perhaps calculating that a fight with senate republican leadership just before the elections was not worth the risk.

if you have insurance, the best way to find prices is to call your insurance company directly. if you don't, the cdm numbers may be a more accurate representation of what you actually have to pay, but in many cases you can also obtain financial aid from the hospital. many hospitals will have a patient advocate or price-transparency officer you can speak with to find the exact cost of a procedure before going in to the facility.
since investors have been conditioned to focus on fees, many fund managers have an almost myopic focus on keeping costs low. in fact, 95% of the $70 billion in net target-date fund flows in 2017 went to passively managed funds.
on a different note, even though i expect 2017 to be an up year for stocks, i think it may turn out to be more volatile overall, with bigger swings up and down. trump is hell-bent on making many rapid and abrupt changes, which are likely to rock share prices. he is also the first president to use his twitter twtr, -4.96% account as a major policy tool. there is only so much one can say with a 140-character limit.
a realistic first step would be to ditch any lingering nostalgic belief that the u.k. has a special relationship with the u.s. the u.k. is, of course, able to wield some influence, from time to time, in specific areas; but there is no escaping the basic fact that the u.k. oday accounts for just 2.5% of global gross domestic product.

why is the yield curve shrinking? simply put, federal reserve policy (see chart). the two-year note is most sensitive to fed policy and heavily correlated to the federal funds rate, as both are deemed to be short-term, risk-free rates. if the yield on the 10-year treasury note tmubmusd10y, 1.710% , which is more sensitive to economic growth and inflation, does not rise as much as the yield on the two-year treasury note tmubmusd02y, 0.165% , the yield curve shrinks (see chart).
analysts said movements in the u.s. dollar continue to be among the biggest factors for gold, with the currency in turn taking its cue from expectations around the federal reserve's rate plans. the dollar has weakened this month on expectations the fed will be less aggressive than previously thought in tightening monetary policy.
lenders must also be responsible in extending credit, including by considering a borrower's ability to repay a loan through an analysis of debt-to-future-expected income. for graduate and professional education this ability to repay requirement should guide both private lenders and the federal government.

perhaps those analysts predicting greater future volatility are simply suffering from recency bias — the behavioral-finance phenomenon involving extrapolating the recent past into the future. it may serve investors well to look a little further back into history before forming expectations following the fed rate hike. returns may indeed be lower in the near future, but it may not be as volatile a ride as many anticipate.

major proposals by the biden campaign would raise $1.6 trillion to $1.9 trillion over a decade from corporations, $1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from high earners through the income tax, and $800 billion to $1 trillion from social security payroll taxes on high-wage earners. biden also supports a fee on banks, which we believe will raise $100 billion, tax credits for renters and first-time homebuyers that we estimate will cost $300 billion, and an increase of the child and dependent care tax credit, which we estimate will cost $100 billion.

furthermore, it's worth adding, even with the fed's boost the stock market this century has been a well-below-average performer. consider the inflation-adjusted return of various stock market averages from their early-2000 highs to the end of 2016, which is when the my ratio hit bottom: the s&p 500 produced just a 0.1% annualized real return over that period, while the nasdaq comp, -3.02% produced an annualized 0.7% loss. the two-century average inflation-adjusted return for equities, according to the wharton school's jeremy siegel, is between 6% and 7% annualized.

a measure of volatility on wall street on monday rose to its highest level in more than 5 months as u.s. equity benchmarks dipped and as the yield in a benchmark treasury note climbed to its highest level in more than three years. the cboe volatility index vix, +12.22% was up about 18% at 13.03, marking its highest level since aug. 18, 2017, according to factset data. the vix uses bullish and bearish option bets on the s&p 500 index to reflect expected volatility over the coming 30 days, and it typically rises as stocks fall. however, the gauge, sometimes referred to as the fear index, has been abnormally low, trading below its historical average at around 20. to be sure, it is still holding at a level below that historic mean but its recent pick up suggests that investors are betting that volatility will accelerate over the coming days and months. a rise in 10-year treasury note yield tmubmusd10y, 1.710% above 2.71% also has drawn attention, because rising rates can undercut appetite for stocks if government paper offer richer yields than risk assets like stocks. rising yields, president donald trump's state of the union speech on tuesday, the federal reserve's updated policy statement on wednesday and a bevy of earnings set to be released throughout the week could induce choppy trade in an otherwise subdued market.

economists are not very good at predicting how large deviations will be. and there are some underlying reasons for why you might see valuation differences. one would be that if you really think we're in a low-interest-rate environment. that means valuations, will, on average, be higher. so the question is, do you think that is a permanent phenomenon or a temporary phenomenon? and obviously when you are talking about stocks, but also to some extent commercial real estate, the tax code matters, and we've just had a tax code change. so those kinds of effects can have an impact on valuation. but i would say that real estate, like other asset classes, are now showing to be a bit higher than what they've been historically and that continues to be a little bit of a concern for me.

so when it is time for us to sell, or even to stop buying, the response could be quite strong; there is every reason to expect a strong response. so there are a couple of ways to look at it. it is about $1.2 trillion in sales; you take 60 months, you get about $20 billion a month. that is a very doable thing, it sounds like, in a market where the norm by the middle of next year is $80 billion a month. another way to look at it, though, is that it's not so much the sale, the duration; it's also unloading our short volatility position. when you turn and say to the market, 'i've got $1.2 trillion of these things,' it's not just $20 billion a month — it's the sight of the whole thing coming. and i think there is a pretty good chance that you could have quite a dynamic response in the market.

2. interest rate rises are likely to be modest, but will still affect bond returns. as interest rates rise, the value of bonds fall. the longer the duration of the bond, the more likely its fall in price. since fixed income investments are a defensive part of a portfolio, designed in part to offer some stability to the overall value of the portfolio, retirees might consider instituting a ladder of cds, purchased directly from banks (and keeping within fdic limits). most cds over 1 year in maturity can be redeemed early with a 180-day interest penalty; if interest rates rise significantly, retirees can exercise this put, in essence, when it makes sense to incur the penalty to reap the higher interest rates for the remainder of the original cd term. a short-term bond fund may be added to the fixed income part of the portfolio, to provide some liquidity. never forget the threat of inflation; while inflation has been low over the past decade, in particular, it could come roaring back at any time; a ladder of inflation-protected securities held in a tax-deferred (401(k) or ira) account, or a bond fund containing tips, might be a prudent part of a person's fixed income portfolio, to help guard against inflation risk.

borrowers whose circumstances have changed since they last filed their tax return — information that won't be reflected in the data retrieval tool — can use other documentation to prove their income, like pay stubs or a letter from their employer. but because those documents typically show net income and not gross income — which is available through tax documents and on which the calculation for income-driven repayment plans are usually based — borrowers' loan payments could wind up being higher, kantrowitz said.

10. other than keeping fees (and there are many hidden fees in investment products) and costs low, the next most important decision relates to strategic asset allocation—i.e., what is the target allocation to various asset classes (u.s. stocks, foreign stocks, fixed income investments, etc.) over the long term. many retirees have investment portfolios that are either too aggressive or too conservative. and most risk tolerance questionnaires lack true insight into how much investment risk you need to take on, as opposed to how much risk you can tolerate. developing a strategic asset allocation, as part of an overall investment policy, is an area that a fee-only, expert financial planner/investment adviser can help a retiree with.

that doesn't mean that we set new speculative-market records every day. stock-price movements tend to approximate what economists call random walks, with prices reflecting small daily shocks that are about equally likely to be positive or negative. and random walks tend to go through long periods when they are well below their previous peak; the chance of setting a record soon is negligible, given how far prices would have to rise. but once they do reach a new record high, prices are far more likely to set additional records – probably not on consecutive days, but within a short interval.

the one bright spot from the bloodletting at the end of 2018 is that expectations have been diminished, leading wall street to expect slower revenue and earnings growth. with much more subdued results now expected for many tech companies, strong growth is likely to be rewarded and slowing growth may not be punished as harshly as it was late last year. as was the case last quarter, all companies will likely be judged more on their outlook than their past results, as investors try to get a handle on where the tech boom will go from here.

finally, fluctuations in productivity play little role over any time frame. certainly, improvements in technology are important, and changes in productivity may be central to the performance of individual stocks. but for explaining why the market as a whole rose more in one period than another — be it a quarter, year, or decade — differences in aggregate productivity growth are rarely the story.
the government's unemployment rate hovered at 6.7% in december, and the number of unemployed workers was 10.7 million. however, the economic policy institute, a progressive think tank, argues that a breakdown of government figures and other estimates based on those paint a far bleaker picture due to the business closures and public-health restrictions related to covid-19: 26.8 million workers are being negatively affected — or nearly 16% of the workforce.

the first step to reduce the balance sheet would be to end reinvestment.
the problem is that the yield curve was a fine indicator of economic performance when the 10-year treasury note yield was driven by market forces. with quantitative easing, this is not so much the case. when the fed begins to unwind its balance sheet in earnest, it could also push the 10-year treasury note yield higher — as it is happening now — in effect, controlling the yield curve and pushing against an inversion, which has preceded every one of the last five recessions.
 'if you're creating a false advertisement of yourself online through airbrushing, the only outcomes are frustration for you — when your date isn't interested in the real you — and annoyance for the other person who invested their time with a you who doesn't truly exist.'  — abby rodman, a psychotherapist in boston
16. plan for 2025. that's about the time we should have self-driving cars. and, as you get older, time proceeds faster (in your perception), which slows your reaction times. these and other factors tend to make driving skills decline over time. with self-driving cars will come far fewer accidents, and car ownership will change. more and more people will have shared cars (just call up a car, using an app), which should cut the cost of car ownership and use dramatically. and, it will aid many older retirees to maintain mobility. so, if you plan to purchase a car anytime soon, plan to keep it for 10 years, and realize that this might be the last car you purchase in your lifetime, as you will rent self-driving cars in the future.

still, some market observers cautioned against reading too much into the oil market's rebound.
rosengren: we've intentionally pushed long-term rates down by having a big balance sheet. we've chosen a path which will not disrupt financial markets which means that our balance sheet comes down quite slowly. until we have more normalized the balance sheet, it is not surprising that long rates are lower than they otherwise would be and it is not just what the u.s. is doing, it is what japan and europe are doing. so they are still expanding their balance sheets, even though we've been pulling back, and so that also is pushing down long-term rates as well.

it is always possible that trump will break the record and manage to engineer the longest economic expansion in history, surpassing 120 months. it is also possible that his policies misfire — such as starting a trade war with china — cutting the present economic expansion short. trump will be the least predictable u.s. president in history, so we just don't know what might happen, but we have to be mindful of the statistical distribution of recessions listed in the table, below. based on all the historical data, i think the probability of a recession during trump's first term is close to 100%.
the current spread between the effective funds rate and 10-year treasury is about 30 basis points. historically, a spread that narrow has been either a precursor to inversion (the fed ignores the signal and keeps raising rates) or the start of a capitulation (the fed realizes the error of its ways and begins to ease aggressively).

the technology sector, when it's not crashing 2000-style, tends to outperform the dow jones industrial average over time as its member companies grow faster; so the present renewed leadership of the nasdaq 100 is a positive sign for the stock market, and i would certainly be looking for the broader market (as represented by the s&p 500) to make new highs too.

the hallmark of trump's plan, which the tax foundation has estimated could cost as much as $6 trillion over the next decade in lost tax revenue, is lowering the number of tax brackets from seven to three: 12%, 25% and 33%. this would squeeze many taxpayers into a lower bracket than their current one, and some would move into a higher marginal tax bracket.

aud/jpy in particular is worth watching. beyond representing a global proxy for risk appetite and the carry trade, the pair also has a strong correlation with major equity indices and so far, the outlook appears bleak. with today's drop, aud/jpy has fallen conclusively below the four-month bullish trend line off the august lows, carving out a potential large bearish marubozu candle* in the process. for the uninitiated, this pattern shows strong selling pressure and often portends more weakness in the coming days.
draeger said in an email that colleges were ecstatic about the new guidance and eager to get students out of the financial aid limbo they've been experiencing since the irs transcript request services went down, unannounced, a few weeks ago.
the fhfa is also exploring the value of appraisal waivers. amid the covid-19 pandemic, federal regulators and housing authorities, along with fannie mae and freddie mac, have relaxed requirements for appraisals on certain loans. while most new loans backed by fannie and freddie during the covid emergency featured traditional appraisals these flexibilities provide a way to protect the health and safety of industry participants, comply with local restrictions throughout the country, and continue to provide liquidity and stability to the market. one of the considerations the fhfa is exploring is whether to allow more permanent waivers for appraisals.

the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% has been whiplashing in the past couple of weeks as trade-war related headlines, speculation over the fed's policy stance and economic data have played havoc with market sentiment. in perhaps the most dramatic sign of what investors are having to contend with, the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% went from having the worst start to a year since 2000 on jan. 3 to posting year-to-date gains of more than 3% wednesday.
other countries have had to do this — australia and new zealand, for example, when in the 1970s the u.k. progressively scaled back its food imports from them under pressure from the european economic community. the british may be instinctively suspicious of grand visions; but some sort of framework of thought is necessary.
longer-term positive influences from fiscal-policy improvements, instead of monetary-policy stimulus, are clear. still, those positives won't be immediate.
eurozone troubles: core inflation is very subdued in the eurozone, particularly outside of germany, and there is a lot of spare capacity in most countries. european central bank policy makers, in minutes from the december meeting that helped explain the decision to extend its bond-buying program, said that while inflation is expected to rise significantly over the coming months due to higher energy prices, underlying inflation had failed to show any clear signs of a convincing upturn.
gender pay gap figures don't adjust for job choice and duration, which all influence pay. women dominate fields like education, which are not typically high-paying. men dominate fields like it, math, engineering and sciences, which tend to have higher-paying jobs. but as more women have achieved a college education and entered the workforce over the last half-century, the gender wage gap has improved. in 1960, women were paid around 61 cents on the dollar compared with men.

this isn't a gripe about the recent selloff, because the market fails when the s&p 500 spx, -0.37% is up and when it's down. specifically, it is failing at three primary functions our society has handed over to the stock market: allocating capital wisely, funding a secure retirement and creating jobs.

bad times tend to be better for women to be given a chance to be ceos, said ariane hegewisch, program director of employment and earnings at the institute for women's policy research. when a company isn't doing well and everyone shies away from it, companies think 'we've tried the usual, now let's give an outsider a chance.' taking the helm during tumultuous times is often riskier for person's career, she added.

for example, we estimate that if there had been no redistributive shifts since 1980, which mostly went in favor of shareholders, the level of the stock market in 2012 would have been only 56% of its observed value. however, these changes do not always favor shareholders. case in point: the period from 1960 to 1980 saw substantial gains for workers at the expense of lower stock returns.

and it's why it is a mistake to look at long-term rates in isolation. what matters is their interaction with the policy rate. the fed funds/10-year spread has narrowed from an ultra-wide 365 basis points in 2010 to 120 basis points today, which still provides an incentive to depository institutions. the failure of long rates to match the fed's rate increases means the fed has less room to tighten policy, especially as the effects of balance-sheet reduction start to kick in.
left unaddressed, poverty among the elderly could drive up federal income tax rates by 10 percentage points. the expenses of poor or near-poor older americans will inevitably be passed on to other citizens, from higher medicaid entitlements (for nursing homes and assisted living costs) to the taxpayer burden from a spike in homelessness.

in some cases, the negative consequences of the proposed changes could depend on how they are enacted. with waivers, trice expressed concerns that more privileged homeowners could have easier access. it's mostly white, wealthy people who get a waiver, and minority and the affordable housing sector don't get waivers, she said. this could lead to disparate impact, she argued, and could drive costs higher for the latter group if appraisers need to make up for lost business.

the 2008 global financial crisis, coupled with the disappointing recovery in the advanced economies that followed, injected a new urgency into china's efforts to shift its growth model from one based on investment and external demand to one underpinned by domestic consumption. navigating such a structural transition without causing a sharp decline in economic growth would be difficult for any country. the challenge is even greater for a country as large and complex as china, especially given today's environment of sluggish global growth.
i would have felt a lot better if the people that grew this enormous balance sheet were there when the unwinding process got going in earnest. this is because of a concern that powell, then a fed governor, voiced in 2012, which was on my mind throughout this whole quantitative-easing business. powell was quoted by zerohedge last week (from the transcripts of the oct. 23-24, 2012, fomc meeting):

an increase in wage growth, however, provided support for the argument that the employment market remains on a solid footing. average hourly wages jumped 0.4% to $26 last month, while hourly pay increased 2.9% from december 2015 to december 2016, marking the fastest 12-month increase since a recovery that began in mid-2009.

the fed, like the world's other central banks, is steadily debasing the currency, in order to create inflation. a google ngrams search of books shows that use of the term inflation targeting began growing exponentially in the early 1990s, when the target was typically far below actual inflation. the idea that we actually want moderate positive inflation — price stability, not zero inflation — appears to have started to take shape in policy circles around the time of the 1990-1991 recession. lawrence summers argued that the public has an irrational resistance to the declining nominal wages that some would have to suffer in a zero-inflation regime.

if you hold investments in taxable brokerage firm accounts, consider the tax advantage of selling appreciated securities that have been held for over 12 months. the federal income tax rate on long-term capital gains recognized in 2020 is only 15% for most folks, although it can reach the maximum 20% rate at high income levels. the add-on 3.8% net investment income tax (niit) can also bite at high income levels. so, the true maximum rate for high-income individuals is 23.8%: the advertised 20% top rate plus 3.8% for the unadvertised niit.

the only thing that goes up in falling markets is correlation (when stock and bond markets decline everything declines in value especially riskless investments) the smart money on wall street, and even main street, invests in only one type of investment: what they feel are undervalued securities. today there are well over 1000 different sector funds and etfs available. sector funds (in which we recommend you invest) allow you to scan the horizon for rallying sectors. when the smart money investors identify an undervalued sector, their investment money start to invest in that sector, they will drive up the price of that sector; the more narrow the sector the more profound the market rise. a diversified portfolio of five or more sector funds allows diversification, liquidity and profit potential for investors. if you have gone to cash before the correction, you will have more money to invest in the recovering markets and you can afford to diversify among a number of sector funds increases the odds of finding a few sectors that generate significant capital gains. given the longer-term momentum of well-undervalued securities in a down market, you have greater odds of earning tax-preferred long-term capital gains as we did with most of our largest portfolio allocations in 2013 and 2014. lower long-term capital-gains profits reduce total return-oriented risk. remember you only have to hold on for a year to qualify for long-term capital gains treatment.

that's why we call ourselves investors when we open a 401(k) or a brokerage account. but in the vast majority of cases, we aren't actually investing anything at all in the company that only happens when a company sells new shares in an initial or secondary public offering. for most of us, the money we supply to buy shares simply goes to earlier shareholders who sold us our shares. we aren't really investors; we are speculators.
