For example, it is not necessarily true that a young worker cannot or should not save for retirement if they carry any debt. While it certainly makes sense to pay off a high-interest loan, a young adult may be better off in the long run putting some money away for retirement while also paying down a low-interest student loan.

That is a very doable thing, it sounds like, in a market where the norm by the middle of next year is $80 billion a month. Another way to look at it, though, is that it's not so much the sale, the duration; it's also unloading our short volatility position. When you turn and say to the market, 'I've got $1.2 trillion of these things,' it's not just $20 billion a month — it's the sight of the whole thing coming.

If a horse carries more weight (similar, for example, to investments with higher fees), the horse still might manage some smart strategy and win a short race, but for longer races the extra weight is definitely going to slow that horse down. By far the largest single factor affecting investor returns in mutual funds, variable annuities, ETFs and other pooled investment vehicles are the fees and costs incurred.

{"original": "Rosengren: I think there are some advantages of having a Fed-led discussion about how we should think about the framework. My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.", "augmented": []}

The longer the duration of the bond, the more likely its fall in price.

Most CDs over 1 year in maturity can be redeemed early with a 180-day interest penalty; if interest rates rise significantly, retirees can exercise this put, in essence, when it makes sense to incur the penalty to reap the higher interest rates for the remainder of the original CD term. A short-term bond fund may be added to the fixed income part of the portfolio, to provide some liquidity. Never forget the threat of inflation; while inflation has been low over the past decade, in particular, it could come roaring back at any time; a ladder of inflation-protected securities held in a tax-deferred (401(k) or IRA) account, or a bond fund containing TIPS, might be a prudent part of a person's fixed income portfolio, to help guard against inflation risk.", "augmented": []}

People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve.

The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed.

We haven't had a bloated balance sheet around the world in previous periods. People who are taking a lot of meaning from the slope of the yield curve, I think, need to consider what it means to be in a different monetary policy framework — which is that Europe, Japan and the United States have a balance sheet that intentionally was suppressing long rates. So the signal value probably isn't quite the same, but it is a reason to your earlier question about why financial conditions haven't tightened more because the balance sheets are likely to only come down gradually over time. Now you could do it differently, and if you want to see the long end of the market go up quickly I can certainly imagine policies of central banks in some part of the world deciding to sell long-term securities would have the impact of pushing up the yield curve. I'm not advocating that. But I think it is an intentional policy. It is not as if this is an unanticipated outcome.", "augmented": []}

Wall Street's most popular measure of uncertainty and anxiety in the stock market, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +12.22% , climbed more than 11% Thursday, marking its sharpest daily rise since Nov. 3, 2016, according to FactSet data. The spike comes as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% , the S&P 500 index SPX, -1.48% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -3.02% have staged their worst declines in weeks. The Dow, for example, is on track for its steepest daily drop since October. The pullback comes as investors rethink a rally in the equity market that has been supported by a raft of policy proposals by President-elect Donald Trump, which include looser regulations on Wall Street, tax cuts and an increase in fiscal spending-- all factors that are expected to boost U.S. economic growth. However, a lack of details on his legislative agenda at Trump's news conference on Wednesday may have raised concerns about his ability to make good on his promises. The VIX is used as a way for investors to bet declines in the S&P 500, and its levels of late have suggested that traders haven't been wary of a big drop in stocks, which means a sudden tumble in equities could catch investors flat-footed. Still, current levels of the VIX at about 12.54 may not immediately raise red flags because readings of about 20 are seen as the clearest indication that fear is taking hold in the market.", "augmented": []}

My own view is that we would be better off having a little more flexibility than having a specific inflation target. I would much rather have an inflation range – something more like 1.5%-3%. And that during times where interest rates were likely to be low because labor force growth was quite low and productivity was quite low, that would be a time that I would actually like a higher level of inflation so I would like to be higher in the range during that period. And during periods of very high productivity then we could be lower. And the reason for that is – and it is partly a financial stability concern – that the current framework where we have low productivity and low population growth and not much immigration, is an environment where we are going to hit the zero lower bound too frequently. And I do think that has significant consequences – both because monetary policy becomes less effective when we can't move short-term interest rates, and I also think that it changes investor and household behavior when you start having periods of prolonged interest rates that are very low and unchanged. So I would like to avoid those kind of outcomes occurring in future recessions and so I think it is a good time to be discussing what is the right framework to reduce that probability.", "augmented": []}

GS, +0.88% slumped $2.58, or 1.1% in morning trade Tuesday, enough to push the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.46% into negative territory, after analyst Keith Horowitz at rival bank Citigroup Inc. C, +0.33% turned bearish on Goldman, on the belief that investors may be too optimistic about revenue growth potential. The price decline was shaving 18 points off the Dow, which was down just 7 points. Horowitz downgraded Goldman to sell from neutral, saying the current stock valuation implies revenue growth of 18% off the 2016 base, while the FactSet revenue consensus for 2017 implies 7.6% growth. While we expect [Goldman] to see improved trading revenues going forward, the path is relatively uncertain and the bar is relatively high, Horowitz wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, Horowitz raised his stock price target to $225, which is 6.4% below current levels, from $200. The stock has rocketed 32% since the election, on optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's policy promises to slash regulation and boost fiscal stimulus, which would boost longer-term Treasury yields.

More generally, Fed officials agreed on the importance of communicating clearly if the future rate policy path became shallower due to a weaker economic outlook or steeper if activity and inflation surprised to the upside."}
