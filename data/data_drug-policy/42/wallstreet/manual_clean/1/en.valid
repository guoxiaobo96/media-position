those four interrelated trends are weighing on aggregate demand in the u.s. and global economies, forcing companies to scale back their investment plans. it's already visible in the data and in surveys of business expectations.
this breakdown in the regular appropriations process coincides neatly with the earmark moratorium, although before the 2011 moratorium, the process did not always go smoothly.
hard data also show that capital spending is softening. real business investment surged at a 10% annual pace in the first half of the year, but slowed to 2.5% in the third quarter. core capital equipment orders and shipments slowed through november, and private nonresidential construction spending has also weakened.
since 2018, many have argued for a return to earmarking to grease the wheels for appropriations bills. pro-earmark arguments have come from members of congress of both parties and president donald trump.
for decades, earmarks paid for pet projects back in lawmakers' districts, with the tacit aim to earn those lawmakers votes. in turn, the awards encouraged legislators to vote for large spending bills. they have long been seen by many members of the public as well as some lawmakers as wasteful and distasteful, and they were banned in 2011.
efforts to revive earmarking over the past few years have been driven by an additional factor: congress' near total inability to pass individual spending bills in a timely manner since the ban was adopted.
unfortunately, the government shutdown means this key data isn't being reported or collected. it's never a good time to fly blind, doubly so now.
there's good reason to believe that the tax cut had almost no impact on business investment. rather, it was strong demand, especially for oil, that encouraged businesses to expand capacity. now investment is softening along with aggregate demand.
it used to be that changes in oil prices mainly affected consumption — lower prices boosted the economy by making energy consumers richer, while higher prices frequently led to recessions. but since the fracking revolution earlier in this decade, changes in oil prices have become highly correlated with changes in investment.
earmarks are vulnerable to other criticisms as well, not least of which is the disproportionate share awarded to the states and districts of the most powerful members.
in addition, the majority party gets disproportionately more earmarks than the minority, although the minority gets enough to make it harder for them to use earmarks as a campaign issue.
traditional oil production is based on long-lasting projects requiring huge investments of hundreds of millions of dollars. the analysis of the profitability of, say, an offshore drilling project doesn't depend on spot crude oil prices us:clg9, but on prices expected for the duration of the project's life. temporary fluctuations in oil prices won't affect this kind of investment.
although the senate has appeared more committed to its ban, senate appropriations chairman richard shelby, r-ala., and other senate republicans and democrats are also receptive to reviving earmarking.
instead, congress has funded government agencies in massive omnibus appropriations bills, and partial- and full-year continuing resolutions, making it virtually impossible for members to know what they were voting for.
but there is evidence that constituents are more likely to reward democrats than republicans. this is not entirely surprising, given that earmarks are consistent with democrats' commitment to activist government, whereas for republicans committed to minimizing the cost of government, bringing home earmarks could be painted as hypocritical.
the continued softening in the index indicates restrained capital spending activity in 2019 as the shine of tax stimulus fades, and slower global growth, uncertainty around trade policy, and tighter financial conditions weigh on investment plans, said morgan stanley economist molly wharton in a note to clients.
the late sen. john mccain, for example, called earmarks the gateway drug to corruption and overspending.
now, hopes that the investment boom would continue into 2019 are in tatters, victim to four factors that are dragging on the economy: reduced fiscal stimulus (including the shutdown), a weakening global economy, the uncertainty of donald trump's trade policy and soft oil prices.
another staffer blamed the failure of leaders to punish disloyal members by removing their earmarks.
businesses invest when they believe demand for their products will rise. right now, fewer companies are confident of that future revenue. most of the leading indicators of demand are slumping as the new year begins.
before 2011, earmarks were regularly and – until 2007 – in increasingly large numbers inserted into appropriations and highway funding bills.
but overspending is in the eye of the beholder. at their peak, earmarks amounted to approximately 3% of the discretionary budget, which itself is about one-third of total federal spending. (discretionary spending is money over which congress has direct control, unlike social security or medicare, for example.) as a result of earmark reform in 2007, reforms that democrats intend to retain, spending on earmarks dropped to 1.3% of the budget.
a month ago, white house economist kevin hassett was insisting that everything was still going as planned. he declared that companies were investing more in equipment, software and facilities, enough to propel u.s. potential growth from an anemic 2% to a stellar 3% or more.
for instance, ihs markit is predicting that u.s. gross domestic product will fade from 2.9% in 2018 to 1.4% in 2023. the federal reserve, the congressional budget office, the imf and other forecasters agree that the tax cut was a temporary jolt, not a game-changer.
while earmarks have been condemned as frivolous at best and corrupt at worst, research on their uses and effects paints a more complex picture of their dynamics. my own research, as well as that of frances lee, shows that such projects helped transportation committee leaders pass three massive highway bills, overcoming significant policy controversies.
after a study of county-level economic data, seth carpenter, chief u.s. economist at ubs securities, concluded that the increase in oil prices was responsible for much of the rebound in fixed investment in 2017, including investments in drilling equipment, storage tanks, pipes, machinery, vehicles, worker housing, and the equipment needed to supply the required sand and water.
my interviews with committee staff members suggested various reasons for this diminished effectiveness. prominent among them, according to one staffer, was the fact that votes were increasingly … on highly charged substantive policy matters. senators needed to vote on those issues in a partisan manner, regardless of earmarks.
the current impetus among house democrats also may be driven by their losses in the 2020 election. the democrats' new majority is currently at 222, compared with 211 for the republicans, with two seats still undecided.
manufacturers in the dallas and kansas city federal reserve districts have noticed, morgan stanley's wharton points out. declining oil prices are a concern going into the first quarter of 2019, one fabricated metal product manufacturer told the dallas fed in december. about half of energy firms in the district have lowered their capital spending plans for 2019.
it's important to define terms from the start. when economists talk about investment, they aren't talking about putting money into the stock market. they are talking about building and maintaining productive assets that will continue to create value for years.
given that the party of the president almost always loses seats in midterm elections, democrats could lose their majority altogether in the 2022 congressional elections. earmarks could help endangered democrats shore up their support among voters back home.
these differences could help explain why, in my research, earmarks provided leaders with less leverage over members' votes in republican-controlled congresses.

that creates a lot of volatility in oil-field investment. high prices attract a lot of investment, but when prices fall, as they did in 2014 and 2015, investment collapses. the dip in u.s. growth rates in 2015 and 2016 was largely due to the impact of lower oil prices on business investment.
that staffer said, people have no shame. they vote no and take the dough.
but producing oil from shale is different in an important way: the investments are much smaller (less than $10 million per well), production can ramp up quickly, and the productive life of any well is much shorter. this means the profitability of investing in a shale-fracking project depends on expected oil prices over the next few years.
most oil investments aren't profitable if the price falls much below $50 a barrel. dallas federal reserve
for earmarks to be effective tools, members might have to vote contrary to their own or their party's preferences. their willingness to do so would undoubtedly depend partly on the electoral consequences.
the u.s. economy needs a higher rate of productivity if we want living standards to improve. the tax cut didn't change the weak trend in business investment. maybe it's time to invest more public money into transportation, alternative energy, education and health care to increase the nation's capital stock and boost our growth rate.
the current level of oil prices puts energy investment on a cusp, wrote carpenter of ubs. further declines in the price of west texas intermediate are likely to have a substantively negative effect on energy's contribution to u.s. gdp.
the evidence for this effect is nuanced, however.
unfortunately, oil prices have fallen again. oil prices, which were near $70 in october, fell to $43 in mid-december and are now around $52. that's right at the midpoint of profitability for most fracking projects, according to the dallas fed's energy survey.
there are three broad classes of fixed investment: structures, such as factories, oil wells and housing; equipment, such as machinery, airplanes and computers; and intellectual property, such as software, new drugs, and blockbuster hollywood movies.
the investment boom that began in 2016 is fading fast, quashing the never-realistic hopes of republicans that the corporate tax cut had permanently transformed the economy for the better.
diana evans is a professor of political science at trinity college in hartford, conn. this was first published by the conversation — the 'gateway drug to corruption and overspending' is returning to congress – but are earmarks really that bad?
congressional earmarks – otherwise known as pork barrel spending – may be coming back.
alexander arnon of the penn wharton budget model estimated in a blog post titled the price of oil is now a key driver of business investment that firmer oil prices accounted for almost all of the growth in investment in 2018.
surveys of manufacturing executives show that the giddy optimism of early 2018 has turned to caution. the new orders component of the ism manufacturing index, for instance, plunged 11 points in december. company guidance, u.s. regional surveys and global purchasing managers surveys are telling the same story: companies are scaling back their plans for capital spending.
now, following the 2020 election, house democrats have apparently decided to return to the practice. majority leader steny hoyer of maryland announced on nov. 20 that the appropriations committee would soon begin soliciting member requests for earmarks, with a focus on projects that would benefit nonprofit organizations and state and local governments.
my own research shows that between 1994 and 2000, as congress went from democratic to republican control, earmarks, once highly effective in inducing members to vote for appropriations bills, became gradually less so.
in the normal appropriations process, congress would pass 12 individual spending bills each year, a process designed to give legislators a chance to examine the spending in each bill before voting.
a year ago, republicans were predicting that their big tax cut for businesses would create a virtuous cycle of higher fixed investment, leading to higher growth rates lasting for years.
earmarks can help members win reelection, especially when members claim credit for them.
nevertheless, earmarks have strong opponents. then-sen. claire mccaskill, d-mo., in 2018 called earmarks the washington swamp creature that just never seems to die. to supporters, on the other hand, earmarks are better seen as a legitimate use of congress' constitutionally conferred power of the purse. and not incidentally, members may benefit in the next election by bringing home the bacon.
as congress wrestles with the process of passing individual appropriations bills, congressional leaders are poised to once again allow earmarks in appropriations bills to ease the bills' passage and protect vulnerable democrats at the polls.
the incentives in the 2017 tax cut had almost nothing to do with the investment boom we saw in 2017 and 2018, which helps explain why many corporate executives and macro-economists don't think the tax cut transformed the economy at all.
likewise, oil and gas drilling activity in the minneapolis fed district slowed notably recently in response to a rapid decline in the price of crude oil, according to the latest beige book. an industry contact reported that expectations for capital expenditures in the bakken oil patch have shifted downward dramatically.
it is difficult to predict how returning to pork-barrel spending would work today.
there's something else going on besides weak aggregate demand: the impact of oil prices on u.s. investment is underappreciated.
economists at morgan stanley say their capex plans index (which is based on the regional fed surveys of capital-spending expectations) has fallen in eight of the past nine months to the lowest level in a year.
as political scientist david mayhew has argued, members believe that bringing home district benefits gives them something for which to claim credit, enhancing their chances for reelection and providing congressional leaders with leverage over their votes.
the negative effects of earmarking for republicans may have grown more powerful. over the past two decades, critics of earmarks have framed them as egregious government waste.
as he often is, hassett was too cheery.
data compiled by the pew research center show that between the 2011 earmark ban and fiscal 2018, only one individual appropriations bill was enacted, rather than the 84 appropriations bills congress should have passed. individual appropriations bills have fared just as poorly in more recent years.
federal spending bills normally allocate an amount of money for general purposes and often defer to federal agency officials or state leaders to determine which particular projects best meet the overall goals. earmarks are specific congressional instructions that carve out some of those funds, declaring directly that x amount of money must be spent on y project.
