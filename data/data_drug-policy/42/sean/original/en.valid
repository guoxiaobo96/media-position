judge jeanine pirro spoke with sean hannity thursday on elizabeth warren's wild policy proposals; saying -if elected- her new deals on healthcare, childcare, and climate would ultimately break this country.\n\nclearly, she has used this to her advantage. i wonder how many people have actually considered the fact that she lied to get ahead, she lied to get into harvard, she lied to make money off of harvard, said pirro on warren's claims of native american ancestry.\n\nunfortunately, the movement is going in her direction because now she's at 25%, edging in on joe biden… she now is smart enough to make all the tactical moves. her deals are going to break this country, it's just not going to work, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\npolling from earlier this month had warren tied with biden just months before democratic voters head to the polls.\n\nthe 2020 candidate pulled off a rare showing in an economist/yougov poll published wednesday, tying the largely untouchable former vice president joe biden with 26 percent support among registered voters. it marks one of the few polls where biden is within danger of losing his frontrunner status, and contains a dismal prediction for sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), reports the week magazine.\n\nbiden has only had a few close calls in previous polls, but warren's 2020 rise has seemingly been eating away at his support as well as sanders'. in a late august poll from monmouth university, sanders and warren topped the pool with 20 percent support, and biden was just behind at 19 percent. in this economist/yougov poll, biden is back up, but so is warren, both leaving sanders a full 10 points behind at 16 percent, adds the website.

new polling could spell big trouble for billionaire mike bloomberg; with data showing the former mayor of new york city widely unpopular with voters across the country.\n\nelectability is a central pillar of former new york mayor michael bloomberg's newly launched presidential campaign, but a poll released tuesday finds he is deeply unpopular with voters nationwide, reports the stamford advocate.\n\na monmouth university poll found about twice as many registered voters rated bloomberg negatively as positively — 54% unfavorable, 26% favorable. that margin was significantly worse than for five other democratic candidates, as well as for president trump. that same measure hampered hillary clinton's campaign in 2016, adds the website.\n\nan official fec complaint was filed against bloomberg news this week after owner michael bloomberg instructed the outlet to investigate president trump; not himself or fellow democrats during the 2020 election.\n\nthe media research center filed a complaint with the federal election commission (fec) against bloomberg media and namesake founder mike bloomberg for the organization's decision to investigate president trump, but not his political opponents, reports fox news.\n\nbloomberg news announced earlier this month that it wouldn't investigate mike bloomberg while he runs for president, or any other democratic presidential candidate for that matter, but would continue to investigate trump, adds fox.\n\nbloomberg news is making a mockery of legitimate journalism. they have consciously chosen to abandon their journalistic responsibilities in favor of what is politically convenient, mrc president brent bozell said in a statement.\n\nthis is a public declaration that bloomberg's newsroom is adopting media bias as an official policy, bozell continued. this is not only categorically unethical, but potentially illegal, which is why we are calling for an investigation.\n\nread the full report here.
a scathing report released this week from senate republicans is shedding new light on hunter biden's relationship with the ukrainian business community and government; stating his position was problematic during the obama administration.\n\nthe 87-page report stated that obama administration officials 'knew' that hunter biden's position on the board of burisma was 'problematic' and that it interfered 'in the efficient execution of policy with respect to ukraine,' reports fox news.\n\nthis investigation has illustrated the extent to which officials within the obama administration ignored the glaring warning signs when the vice president's son joined the board of a company owned by a corrupt ukrainian oligarch, the report's executive summary stated.\n\nwell, it looks like the one job that joe biden created in his 47 years in politics was really lucrative.https://t.co/8cfv2hsvdv — mike kelly for congress (@mikekellyforpa) september 23, 2020\n\neven though hunter biden's position on burisma's board cast a shadow over the work of those advancing anticorruption reforms in ukraine, the committees are only aware of two individuals who raised concerns to their superiors, the senate report stated. despite the efforts of these individuals, their concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nread the full report at fox news.
president bill clinton was the second president in the history of the united states to be impeached by the house of representatives.\n\nhe is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free.\n\nclinton's comments are a stark contrast to statement she made earlier this week, writing the president of the united states has betrayed our country. that's not a political statement—it's a harsh reality, and we must act. he is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. i support impeachment.\n\nfrom everything we know and we don't know much, this is an experienced person who saw things that bothered him. that's what the whole whistle-blower statute is for. and it is to protect their identity. and i understand he's going to testify and we'll let the process unfold, she added.\n\ni think the evidence concerning ukraine is so dramatic and irrefutable because it came right out of the white house . so let the impeachment inquiry proceed, clinton told abc news. i know that they will do a thoughtful, thorough job. nobody should jump to any conclusions.\n\ntwice-failed presidential candidate hillary clinton seemingly backed-off her latest calls for impeachment tuesday; warning fellow democrats to not jump to any conclusions on the ukraine.\n\ngiuliani on hannity: ukraine gave me 'substantial evidence of collusion with hillary clinton, dnc'\n\nposted by hannity staff - 10.03.19\n\nformer new york city mayor rudy giuliani stopped-by 'hannity' wednesday night to weigh-in on the democrats' latest impeachment push; saying ukraine has given him substantial evidence of collusion with hillary clinton and the dnc.\n\nthe big announcement was that the inspector general at the state department was going to give all these secret documents to the committee, and they were sitting there figuring out how they could do impeachment based on nothing, said giuliani.\n\nwhat they got shoved down their throats is a complete, total prosecutorial outline of why joe biden is so guilty… it's a joke for me even to have to describe it… the ukrainians brought me substantial evidence of collusion with hillary clinton and the dnc, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\ngiuliani's comments come one day after a spokesperson for rep. adam schiff confirmed he had advanced knowledge of the whistleblower complaint against president trump.\n\na spokesman for house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff, d-calif., acknowledged wednesday that the whistleblower alleging misconduct in the white house had reached out to schiff's panel before filing a complaint — prompting president trump, in an extraordinary afternoon press conference at the white house, to directly accuse schiff of helping write the document, reports fox news.\n\nit shows that schiff is a fraud. … i think it's a scandal that he knew before, said the president during a press conference at the white house. i'd go a step further. i'd say he probably helped write it. … that's a big story. he knew long before, and he helped write it too. it's a scam.\n\nadam schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of secretary of state mike pompeo. for a lowlife like schiff, who completely fabricated my words and read them to congress as though they were said by me, to demean a first in class at west point, is sad! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) october 2, 2019\n\nlike other whistleblowers have done before and since under republican and democratic-controlled committees, the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community, patrick boland, a spokesman for schiff and the house intelligence committee, told fox news. this is a regular occurrence, given the committee's unique oversight role and responsibilities. consistent with the committee's longstanding procedures, committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an inspector general and to seek legal counsel.
controversial congresswoman ilhan omar was ordered friday to pay-back over $3,000 and pay additional fines for violating campaign finance laws during her time as a state representative in minnesota.\n\nfreshman rep. ilhan omar has been ordered to reimburse her campaign account about $3,500 and to pay a fine of $500 after an investigation found she illegally used campaign funds in 2016 and 2017, reports the new york post.\n\nthe illegal donations date back to when omar, who represents a district in minnesota, served as a state representative, adds the post.\n\ni'm glad this process is complete and that the campaign finance board has come to a resolution on this matter, omar told the newspaper in a statement.\n\nomar made national headlines following her swearing-in last january on a series of issues; including anti-israeli remarks, flippant comments regarding the 9/11 terror attacks, vicious comments towards the president, and more.\n\nlast week, the far-left legislator claimed the white house was weaponizing the us census to target minorities.\n\nit's now explicit: trump is weaponizing the census to benefit 'republicans and non-hispanic whites.' this is an attack on democracy and in any other administration, it would be a multi-year scandal, posted omar on social media.\n\nit's now explicit: trump is weaponizing the census to benefit republicans and non-hispanic whites. this is an attack on democracy and in any other administration, it would be a multi-year scandal. https://t.co/euywt5p9vz — rep. ilhan omar (@ilhan) may 30, 2019\n\nthe far-left legislator found herself in hot-water earlier this month when she posted -then deleted- a tweet that claimed latin american migrants could never enter the united states using president trump's proposed merit-based immigration system.\n\na 'merit based' immigration policy is fueled by racism towards the latinx community, omar wrote. our immigration policies shouldn't be based on discrimination, fear, or bigotry. we should welcome immigrants to our country and offer a simple way to citizenship.\n\nsen. ted cruz, the son of a cuban immigrant who earned math degree and became a computer program, slammed omar's comments as deeply troubling.\n\nas the son of a cuban immigrant whose dad came to get a math degree & become a computer programmer, i'm troubled that dems seem to believe hispanic immigrants can't qualify for skills-based legal immigration. bringing in more scientists, engineers & doctors is good for us jobs, posted cruz.\n\nas the son of a cuban immigrant whose dad came to get a math degree & become a computer programmer, i'm troubled that dems seem to believe hispanic immigrants can't qualify for skills-based legal immigration. bringing in more scientists, engineers & doctors is good for us jobs. https://t.co/iugnizgjtl — ted cruz (@tedcruz) may 29, 2019
as the times noted, biden's memoir makes no mention of any such arrest. as far as we can tell, biden never mentioned this arrest before; neither can we locate any news accounts of him being arrested, adds the post .\n\njoe biden has told voters at least three times that he was arrested in south africa while trying to visit nelson mandela. he has also said mandela thanked him for being arrested. there's no evidence to back up either claim, ⁦ @glennkesslerwp ⁩ reports. https://t.co/itgkumsquh\n\nthis day, 30 years ago, nelson mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid. i had the great honor of meeting him. i had the great honor of being arrested with our u.n. ambassador on the streets of soweto trying to get to see him on robbens island, claims the former vice president.\n\nthe washington post shot-down joe biden's recent claims he was arrested alongside the us ambassador to the un while attempting to visit nelson mandela during a trip 30 years ago.\n\nbiden claims firearms have killed more than half of the u.s. population since 2007 pic.twitter.com/a679hcvbyg\n\n150 million people have been killed since 2007 when bernie voted to exempt gun manufacturers from liabilities. more than all the wars -including vietnam- from that point on. carnage on our streets. if i'm elected, the nra, i'm coming for you, said biden to applause.\n\nformer vice president joe biden continued his gaffe-filled campaign campaign during tuesday night's democratic debate in south carolina; telling the audience roughly 45% of the us population has been killed by gun violence since 2007.\n\nbiden on botched war story: 'details are irrelevant'\n\nposted by hannity staff - 9.03.19\n\ndemocratic frontrunner joe biden pushed-back against allegations he misstated multiple facts regarding his visit to afghanistan this week; saying the details of the trip are irrelevant.\n\nthat has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a healthcare policy, biden told npr following a series of speaking gaffes on the campaign trail in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nthe details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making, he added.\n\ni campaigned like the devil for hillary, but hillary had different positions than the president had, and she emphasized different aspects of what would have occurred had i been the nominee, said biden. that doesn't mean i would've won. i don't mean that.\n\nthe controversy began at a campaign stop in hanover, new hampshire, where the democratic presidential hopeful captivated an audience of more than 400 attendees; sharing with them a personal story about his trip to the kundera province in afghanistan in 2008. the only problem? the story wasn't true.\n\nthe navy captain, biden recalled friday night, had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an american comrade, carrying him on his back. now the general wanted biden to pin a silver star on the american hero who, despite his bravery, felt like a failure, according to ctpost.\n\nhe said, 'sir, i don't want the damn thing! biden said, his jaw clenched and his voice rising to a shout. 'do not pin it on me, sir! please, sir. do not do that! he died. he died,' adds the report.\n\nbiden continued, this is the god's truth. my word as a biden.\n\nalmost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect. based on interviews with more than a dozen u.s. troops, their commanders and biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened, reports the ctpost.\n\non numerous occasions biden has told this story, and it appears he plays loose and fast with the facts. the time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch, the rank of the recipient – even his own role in the ceremony – all subject to change.\n\nread the full report here.
