Secretary of State Mike Pompeo slammed John Kerry for undermining the Trump administration this week; telling his predecessor to get off the stage and cease all communications with Iran.\n\nPompeo made the comments in a Fox News Radio interview with Guy Benson on Thursday amid the increasing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, and the calls to investigate Kerry, the former secretary of state under President Obama, over the alleged violations of the Logan Act for meeting with Iranian officials, reports Fox News.\n\nIt is ahistorical and completely unhelpful when previous secretaries of state are continuing to engage in the tasks that they engaged in when they were the secretary of state … it's time to get off the stage for the previous administration, said Pompeo.\n\nI understand they have different views than we have, they are entitled to those views. But talking with senior leaders around the world and suggesting to them somehow that waiting out this administration is the best course of action for those countries is something that is unheard of, he added. It is fundamentally different than any previous administration has undertaken and they ought to leave the foreign policy to us.\n\n.@SecPompeo gave @guypbenson intel surrounding possible new threats from Iran. You can listen to the entire one on one interview during The #GuyBensonShow 6-8 PM ET https://t.co/uhVfsjEpSq pic.twitter.com/UJ9j6khRAo — The Guy Benson Show (@GuyBensonShow) May 16, 2019\n\nKerry is facing renewed criticism after revealing the former Secretary of State continued his communications with senior Iranian officials after President Trump's inauguration in January 2017.\n\nPresident Trump weighing-in on Kerry's ongoing meetings this week; saying the top Obama official should be prosecuted for violating the Logan Act.\n\nYou know John Kerry speaks to them a lot, and John Kerry tells them not to call. That's a violation of the Logan Act, and frankly he should be prosecuted on that, Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nBut my people don't want to do anything, only the Democrats do that kind of stuff. If it were the opposite way, they'd prosecute him under the Logan Act, he said.
President Trump continued his all-out war with Radical Democrats Tuesday morning; saying there's not a racist bone in his body and that progressive lawmakers hate our country.\n\nOur Country is Free, Beautiful and Very Successful. If you hate our Country, or if you are not happy here, you can leave! tweeted the Commander-in-Chief.\n\nThose Tweets were NOT Racist. I don't have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show 'weakness' and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country. Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said. Omar is polling at 8%, Cortez at 21%. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020! he added.\n\nOur Country is Free, Beautiful and Very Successful. If you hate our Country, or if you are not happy here, you can leave! — Donald J.

Horrible anti-Israel, anti-USA, pro-terrorist & public shouting of the F…word, among many other terrible things, and the petrified Dems run for the hills. Why isn't the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left, and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad! tweeted Trump.\n\n…..shouting of the F…word, among many other terrible things, and the petrified Dems run for the hills.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2019\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi is poised to introduce new legislation this week that directly condemns President Trump's xenophobic tweets regarding radical Democrats currently serving in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe House cannot allow the President's characterization of immigrants to our country to stand. Our Republican colleagues must join us in condemning the President's xenophobic tweets, Pelosi wrote in a letter.\n\nThis weekend, the President went beyond his own low standards using disgraceful language about Members of Congress, she added. Rather than attack Members of Congress, he should work with us for humane immigration policy that reflects American values.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer used Robert Mueller's 'No Collusion' final report Friday to attack President Trump's economic policy; bizarrely asserting that the special counsel's conclusions prove the President isn't working for middle class Americans.\n\nThe Mueller report shows how dense the Trump swamp is, how dishonest this president is, and how erratic this administration is, posted Schumer on social media. It's no wonder the middle class is not making progress under this administration.\n\nThe Mueller report shows how dense the Trump swamp is, how dishonest this president is, and how erratic this administration is.

Recently sworn-in Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez finally lifted the curtain on her 'Green New Deal' Thursday; calling for sweeping environmental and energy changes as House Speaker Pelosi dismissed the policy as a Green Dream.\n\nThe proposal calls for a 10-year transition from fossil fuels towards 100% renewable energy across the country, as well as sweeping social changes including new infrastructure, a revamped healthcare system, and a federal jobs program.\n\nThe Green New Deal fully tackles the existential threat posed by climate change by presenting a comprehensive, 10-year plan that is as big as the problem it hopes to solve while creating a new era of shared prosperity, says a summary of the legislation.\n\nIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive, Speaker Pelosi told Politico on Wednesday. The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\n\nRead the full report at Fox News.

Judge Jeanine Pirro spoke with Sean Hannity Thursday on Elizabeth Warren's wild policy proposals; saying -if elected- her new deals on healthcare, childcare, and climate would ultimately break this country.\n\nClearly, she has used this to her advantage. I wonder how many people have actually considered the fact that she lied to get ahead, she lied to get into Harvard, she lied to make money off of Harvard, said Pirro on Warren's claims of Native American ancestry.\n\nUnfortunately, the movement is going in her direction because now she's at 25%, edging in on Joe Biden… She now is smart enough to make all the tactical moves. Her deals are going to break this country, it's just not going to work, she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling from earlier this month had Warren tied with Biden just months before Democratic voters head to the polls.\n\nThe 2020 candidate pulled off a rare showing in an Economist/YouGov poll published Wednesday, tying the largely untouchable former Vice President Joe Biden with 26 percent support among registered voters. It marks one of the few polls where Biden is within danger of losing his frontrunner status, and contains a dismal prediction for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), reports The Week magazine.\n\nBiden has only had a few close calls in previous polls, but Warren's 2020 rise has seemingly been eating away at his support as well as Sanders'. In a late August poll from Monmouth University, Sanders and Warren topped the pool with 20 percent support, and Biden was just behind at 19 percent. In this Economist/YouGov poll, Biden is back up, but so is Warren, both leaving Sanders a full 10 points behind at 16 percent, adds the website.

The Coronavirus crisis crippled Hollywood and the US movie businesses this week, with theaters across North America recording a 97% plunge in box office receipts as viewers stay home and practice social distancing.\n\nAs theaters across the country close their doors due to government mandates prohibiting large gatherings, it means that ticket sales have been reduced to almost nothing. After hitting a 20-year low over the weekend, the box office has now sunk even lower, reports Fox News.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, on Wednesday box office sales were only $300,000. By contrast, at the exact same time last year, ticket sales in North America made up roughly $10.7 million in revenue. That marks a historic 97 percent year-over-year decline. To demonstrate how quickly the coronavirus situation impacted the industry, the outlet reports that this time last week the box office total was $7.7 million. It is estimated that only 440 theaters in the United States remained open throughout the week, adds Fox.\n\nThis is an unprecedented challenge to the business, said John Fithian, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners. We're looking to Congress and White House to understand this is a cultural institution where people gather.\n\nWe want our policy makers to know that at the end of this thing, when people have been cooped up in their house for several months, they'll need a break to go out and do something collectively that's affordable and fun and away from what they've just been through, he said. But we still need to be viable.\n\nRead the full report at Fox News.

When I talk about health care being a human right, the last time I heard that undocumented people are human beings, he fired-back.\n\nBernie Sanders' campaign released a new Democratic Socialist 'Economic Bill of Rights' weeks ago; saying all Americans should be provided with healthcare, education, a 'good job,' housing, secure retirement, and more.\n\nWe need a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights:\n\n– The right to health care\n\n– The right to education\n\n– The right to a good job\n\n– The right to affordable housing\n\n– The right to a secure retirement\n\n– The right to a clean environment#DemocraticSocialism, posted Josh Miller-Lewis, Sanders' Digital Communications Director.\n\nRead the full report here.

The Patriot and Avenger anti-missile defense systems are deployed to other locations in the Middle East, but not to the two Iraqi bases targeted by Iran. Officials say the American assets are in high demand and short supply around the world, reports Fox News.
The United States healthcare system is facing new challenges as the nation struggles under Obamacare's burdensome regulations, with many doctors changing careers over mounting costs and increasing uncertainty.\n\nAccording to a new report from NBC News, New York University unveiled its new policy of tuition free medical school for all incoming students; hoping to lure prospective doctors amid a growing crisis.\n\nRecently released data by the American Medical Colleges Association showed the United States will face a doctor shortage of 42,600 by 2030.\n\nThe stunning report blames the impending shortage on the growth of more lucrative high-tech jobs, escalating financial burdens, a bloated bureaucracy, and increasing uncertainty surrounding the future of Obamacare.\n\nThere are definitely fewer people going to [med school] and more going into careers like engineering, said an industry insider.

Democratic Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders offered a one-word answer when pressed on his controversial Medicare for All program Thursday; confirming no one in America should be able to keep their private insurance.\n\nI'm a math teacher and I love polling data… Based on recent polling, Democratic voters, more than half of them prefer to keep their private health insurance. If Medicare for All was an option, would you give them that choice? asked a member of the audience.\n\nNope, said Sanders.\n\nNope: Bernie Sanders refuses to even consider not eliminating all private health insurance planshttps://t.co/QriLCDzek5 pic.twitter.com/PwV0r7gVI4 — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 12, 2019\n\nRecent polling showed a major shake-up in the Democratic primary process this week, with Senator Elizabeth Warren surpassing Bernie Sanders for the second-place spot just behind former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that 26 percent of likely primary voters support Biden, while 19 percent support Warren. Trailing those two are Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders(I-Vt.), who are each backed by 13 percent, reports The Hill.\n\nThe only other contenders who receive support from more than 1 percent of voters are South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg with 7 percent, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke with 2 percent and former tech executive Andrew Yang with 2 percent, adds the site.\n\nWarren introduced a new plan this week that would essentially decriminalize those caught illegally entering the United States; raising serious new questions over the Democrat's immigration policy heading into the 2020 election.\n\nEntering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist Senator, it's also a criminal violation. This additional criminal provision is totally unnecessary for border security, and for a century, it was rarely enforced. But since the early 2000s, it has been used to build and sustain a massive immigration detention complex, writes Warren in an op-ed published by Medium.\n\nIn 2016, over half of all federal criminal prosecutions were for immigration violations — more than prosecutions for terrorism, organized crime, hate crimes, or financial fraud. This obsessive focus ties up federal prosecutors and overwhelms federal courts. It's costly and unnecessary. And under Trump, it has become increasingly abusive, she adds.\n\nWe should repeal this criminal prohibition to prevent future abuse. As president, I will immediately issue guidance to end criminal prosecutions for simple administrative immigration violations; end Operation Streamline, which subjects migrants to mass prosecutions; and refocus our limited resources on actual criminals and real threats to the United States, Warren concludes.
New polling could spell big trouble for billionaire Mike Bloomberg; with data showing the former Mayor of New York City widely unpopular with voters across the country.\n\nElectability is a central pillar of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's newly launched presidential campaign, but a poll released Tuesday finds he is deeply unpopular with voters nationwide, reports the Stamford Advocate.\n\nA Monmouth University poll found about twice as many registered voters rated Bloomberg negatively as positively — 54% unfavorable, 26% favorable. That margin was significantly worse than for five other Democratic candidates, as well as for President Trump. That same measure hampered Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016, adds the website.\n\nAn official FEC complaint was filed against Bloomberg News this week after owner Michael Bloomberg instructed the outlet to investigate President Trump; not himself or fellow Democrats during the 2020 election.\n\nThe Media Research Center filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against Bloomberg Media and namesake founder Mike Bloomberg for the organization's decision to investigate President Trump, but not his political opponents, reports Fox News.\n\nBloomberg News announced earlier this month that it wouldn't investigate Mike Bloomberg while he runs for president, or any other Democratic presidential candidate for that matter, but would continue to investigate Trump, adds Fox.\n\nBloomberg News is making a mockery of legitimate journalism. They have consciously chosen to abandon their journalistic responsibilities in favor of what is politically convenient, MRC president Brent Bozell said in a statement.\n\nThis is a public declaration that Bloomberg's newsroom is adopting media bias as an official policy, Bozell continued. This is not only categorically unethical, but potentially illegal, which is why we are calling for an investigation.\n\nRead the full report here.
A scathing report released this week from Senate Republicans is shedding new light on Hunter Biden's relationship with the Ukrainian business community and government; stating his position was problematic during the Obama administration.\n\nThe 87-page report stated that Obama administration officials 'knew' that Hunter Biden's position on the board of Burisma was 'problematic' and that it interfered 'in the efficient execution of policy with respect to Ukraine,' reports Fox News.\n\nThis investigation has illustrated the extent to which officials within the Obama administration ignored the glaring warning signs when the vice president's son joined the board of a company owned by a corrupt Ukrainian oligarch, the report's executive summary stated.\n\nWell, it looks like the one job that Joe Biden created in his 47 years in politics was really lucrative.https://t.co/8Cfv2HsvDV — Mike Kelly for Congress (@MikeKellyforPA) September 23, 2020\n\nEven though Hunter Biden's position on Burisma's board cast a shadow over the work of those advancing anticorruption reforms in Ukraine, the Committees are only aware of two individuals who raised concerns to their superiors, the Senate report stated. Despite the efforts of these individuals, their concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nRead the full report at Fox News.
President Bill Clinton was the second president in the history of the United States to be impeached by the House of Representatives.\n\nHe is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free.\n\nClinton's comments are a stark contrast to statement she made earlier this week, writing The president of the United States has betrayed our country. That's not a political statement—it's a harsh reality, and we must act. He is a clear and present danger to the things that keep us strong and free. I support impeachment.\n\nFrom everything we know and we don't know much, this is an experienced person who saw things that bothered him. That's what the whole whistle-blower statute is for. And it is to protect their identity. And I understand he's going to testify and we'll let the process unfold, she added.\n\nI think the evidence concerning Ukraine is so dramatic and irrefutable because it came right out of the White House . So let the impeachment inquiry proceed, Clinton told ABC News. I know that they will do a thoughtful, thorough job. Nobody should jump to any conclusions.\n\nTwice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton seemingly backed-off her latest calls for impeachment Tuesday; warning fellow Democrats to not jump to any conclusions on the Ukraine.\n\nGIULIANI ON HANNITY: Ukraine Gave Me 'Substantial Evidence of Collusion with Hillary Clinton, DNC'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 10.03.19\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani stopped-by 'Hannity' Wednesday night to weigh-in on the Democrats' latest impeachment push; saying Ukraine has given him substantial evidence of collusion with Hillary Clinton and the DNC.\n\nThe big announcement was that the Inspector General at the State Department was going to give all these secret documents to the Committee, and they were sitting there figuring out how they could do impeachment based on nothing, said Giuliani.\n\nWhat they got shoved down their throats is a complete, total prosecutorial outline of why Joe Biden is so guilty… It's a joke for me even to have to describe it… The Ukrainians brought me substantial evidence of collusion with Hillary Clinton and the DNC, he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiuliani's comments come one day after a spokesperson for Rep. Adam Schiff confirmed he had advanced knowledge of the whistleblower complaint against President Trump.\n\nA spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., acknowledged Wednesday that the whistleblower alleging misconduct in the White House had reached out to Schiff's panel before filing a complaint — prompting President Trump, in an extraordinary afternoon press conference at the White House, to directly accuse Schiff of helping write the document, reports Fox News.\n\nIt shows that Schiff is a fraud. … I think it's a scandal that he knew before, said the President during a press conference at the White House. I'd go a step further. I'd say he probably helped write it. … That's a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it too. It's a scam.\n\nAdam Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains, honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. For a lowlife like Schiff, who completely fabricated my words and read them to Congress as though they were said by me, to demean a First in Class at West Point, is SAD! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nLike other whistleblowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled Committees, the whistleblower contacted the Committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the Intelligence Community, Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff and the House Intelligence Committee, told Fox News. This is a regular occurrence, given the Committee's unique oversight role and responsibilities. Consistent with the Committee's longstanding procedures, Committee staff appropriately advised the whistleblower to contact an Inspector General and to seek legal counsel.
Controversial Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was ordered Friday to pay-back over $3,000 and pay additional fines for violating campaign finance laws during her time as a state representative in Minnesota.\n\nFreshman Rep. Ilhan Omar has been ordered to reimburse her campaign account about $3,500 and to pay a fine of $500 after an investigation found she illegally used campaign funds in 2016 and 2017, reports the New York Post.\n\nThe illegal donations date back to when Omar, who represents a district in Minnesota, served as a state representative, adds the Post.\n\nI'm glad this process is complete and that the Campaign Finance Board has come to a resolution on this matter, Omar told the newspaper in a statement.\n\nOmar made national headlines following her swearing-in last January on a series of issues; including anti-Israeli remarks, flippant comments regarding the 9/11 terror attacks, vicious comments towards the President, and more.\n\nLast week, the far-left legislator claimed the White House was weaponizing the US census to target minorities.\n\nIt's now explicit: Trump is weaponizing the Census to benefit 'Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.' This is an attack on democracy and in any other Administration, it would be a multi-year scandal, posted Omar on social media.\n\nIt's now explicit: Trump is weaponizing the Census to benefit Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites.

Ilhan Omar (@Ilhan) May 30, 2019\n\nThe far-left legislator found herself in hot-water earlier this month when she posted -then deleted- a Tweet that claimed Latin American migrants could never enter the United States using President Trump's proposed Merit-based immigration system.\n\nA 'merit based' immigration policy is fueled by racism towards the Latinx community, Omar wrote. Our immigration policies shouldn't be based on discrimination, fear, or bigotry. We should welcome immigrants to our country and offer a simple way to citizenship.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, the son of a Cuban immigrant who earned Math Degree and became a computer program, slammed Omar's comments as deeply troubling.\n\nAs the son of a Cuban immigrant whose Dad came to get a math degree & become a computer programmer, I'm troubled that Dems seem to believe Hispanic immigrants can't qualify for skills-based legal immigration. Bringing in more scientists, engineers & doctors is good for US jobs, posted Cruz.\n\nAs the son of a Cuban immigrant whose Dad came to get a math degree & become a computer programmer, I'm troubled that Dems seem to believe Hispanic immigrants can't qualify for skills-based legal immigration.

As the Times noted, Biden's memoir makes no mention of any such arrest. As far as we can tell, Biden never mentioned this arrest before; neither can we locate any news accounts of him being arrested, adds the Post .\n\nJoe Biden has told voters at least three times that he was arrested in South Africa while trying to visit Nelson Mandela. He has also said Mandela thanked him for being arrested. There's no evidence to back up either claim, ⁦ @GlennKesslerWP ⁩ reports. https://t.co/iTgKumSqUh\n\nThis day, 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid. I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested with our U.N. ambassador on the streets of Soweto trying to get to see him on Robbens Island, claims the former Vice President.\n\nThe Washington Post shot-down Joe Biden's recent claims he was arrested alongside the US Ambassador to the UN while attempting to visit Nelson Mandela during a trip 30 years ago.\n\nBiden claims firearms have killed more than half of the U.S. population since 2007 pic.twitter.com/a679hcVbYg\n\n150 million people have been killed since 2007 when Bernie voted to exempt gun manufacturers from liabilities. More than all the wars -including Vietnam- from that point on. Carnage on our streets. If I'm elected, the NRA, I'm coming for you, said Biden to applause.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden continued his gaffe-filled campaign campaign during Tuesday night's Democratic Debate in South Carolina; telling the audience roughly 45% of the US population has been killed by gun violence since 2007.\n\nBIDEN ON BOTCHED WAR STORY: 'Details Are Irrelevant'\n\nposted by Hannity Staff - 9.03.19\n\nDemocratic frontrunner Joe Biden pushed-back against allegations he misstated multiple facts regarding his visit to Afghanistan this week; saying the details of the trip are irrelevant.\n\nThat has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a healthcare policy, Biden told NPR following a series of speaking gaffes on the campaign trail in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making, he added.\n\nI campaigned like the devil for Hillary, but Hillary had different positions than the president had, and she emphasized different aspects of what would have occurred had I been the nominee, said Biden. That doesn't mean I would've won. I don't mean that.\n\nThe controversy began at a campaign stop in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the democratic presidential hopeful captivated an audience of more than 400 attendees; sharing with them a personal story about his trip to the Kundera province in Afghanistan in 2008. The only problem? The story wasn't true.\n\nThe Navy captain, Biden recalled Friday night, had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved the body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back. Now the general wanted Biden to pin a Silver Star on the American hero who, despite his bravery, felt like a failure, according to CTPost.\n\nHe said, 'Sir, I don't want the damn thing! Biden said, his jaw clenched and his voice rising to a shout. 'Do not pin it on me, Sir! Please, Sir. Do not do that! He died. He died,' adds the report.\n\nBiden continued, This is the God's truth. My word as a Biden.\n\nAlmost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect. Based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened, reports the CTPost.\n\nOn numerous occasions Biden has told this story, and it appears he plays loose and fast with the facts. The time period, the location, the heroic act, the type of medal, the military branch, the rank of the recipient – even his own role in the ceremony – all subject to change.\n\nRead the full report here.
