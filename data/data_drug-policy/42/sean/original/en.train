the top ten democratic presidential candidates will finally share the same stage in houston, texas thursday night; ending months of back-and-forth jabs between the top-three challengers.\n\nformer vice president joe biden, vermont senator bernie sanders, and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren will have a chance to press each other for the first time in the 2020 primary process.\n\ndespite the miles traveled, the tens of millions of dollars raised and the ceaseless churn of policy papers, the democratic primary has been remarkably static for months with joe biden leading in polls and elizabeth warren and bernie sanders vying to be the progressive alternative. that stability is under threat on thursday, reports the associated press.\n\nall of the top presidential candidates will share a debate stage, a setting that could make it harder to avoid skirmishes among the early front-runners. the other seven candidates, meanwhile, are under growing pressure to prove they're still in the race to take on president donald trump next november, adds the ap.\n\nthe debate marks the first time sen. warren is widely seen as a potential frontrunner; rising in recent polls that has her tied at 26% alongside joe biden.\n\nfor me, this is just a better chance to talk about why i'm in this fight, warren told reporters, adding the way i have all along. and that is, i'm someone who will fight for your family. i'm not here to fight for the rich and powerful.\n\nread the full report here.

the real collusion in the 2016 election was not between the trump campaign and the kremlin. it was between the clinton campaign and the obama administration.\n\n\n\nthe media–democrat collusion narrative, which paints donald trump as cat's paw of russia, is a studiously crafted illusion.\n\ndespite clinton's commanding lead in the polls, hyper-partisan intelligence officials decided they needed an insurance policy against a trump presidency. thus was born the collusion narrative, built on an anonymously sourced dossier, secretly underwritten by the clinton campaign and compiled by a former british spy. though acknowledged to be salacious and unverified at the fbi's highest level, the dossier was used to build a counterintelligence investigation against trump's campaign.\n\nmiraculously, trump won anyway. but his political opponents refused to accept the voters' decision. their collusion narrative was now peddled relentlessly by political operatives, intelligence agents, justice department officials, and media ideologues―the vanguard of the trump resistance. through secret surveillance, high-level intelligence leaking, and tireless news coverage, the public was led to believe that trump conspired with russia to steal the election.\n\nnot one to sit passively through an onslaught, president trump fought back in his tumultuous way. matters came to a head when he fired his fbi director, who had given explosive house testimony suggesting the president was a criminal suspect, despite privately assuring trump otherwise. the resulting firestorm of partisan protest cowed the justice department to appoint a special counsel, whose seemingly limitless investigation bedeviled the administration for two years.\n\nyet as months passed, concrete evidence of collusion failed to materialize. was the collusion narrative an elaborate fraud? and if so, choreographed by whom? against media–democrat caterwauling, a doughty group of lawmakers forced a shift in the spotlight from trump to his investigators and accusers. this has exposed the depth of politicization within american law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. it is now clear that the institutions on which our nation depends for objective policing and clear-eyed analysis injected themselves scandalously into the divisive politics of the 2016 election.\n\nthey failed to forge a new clinton administration. will they succeed in bringing down president trump?\n\npick up your copy of ball of collusion here

the heritage organization released a scathing report wednesday highlighting dhs secretary alejandro mayorkas misleading and flat-out false assertions about the spiraling crisis sweeping the us-mexico border.\n\nfrom the heritage foundation:\n\nclaim #1: the expulsion of single adults does not pose an operational challenge for the border patrol…\n\nrating: false\n\none wonders if mayorkas ran this line by the men and women of the border patrol before saying it publicly, because if he had, he would've been embarrassed to make such a claim. our border patrol agents are apprehending 4,500-6,000 illegal aliens per day. former dhs secretary jeh johnson said in 2019 that under the obama administration, 1,000 apprehensions was a crisis. we are at six times this volume today, and to suggest that dealing with this massive increase is not an operational challenge for the border patrol is to deny not just reality, but basic math. – former acting cbp commissioner mark morgan\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #2: we are expelling most…families.\n\nrating: false\n\nthe administration is not utilizing all of its authorities with regards to the surge of family units. the facts tell us that the administration is not expelling 'most' families under title 42 as they claim. according to dhs data, the administration expelled only 41% of family units in february, down from 76% in december under the trump administration. washington post reporter nick miroff pointed out this fact just this week. this is important, as the smugglers and cartels will capitalize on this fact and continue to push family units across the border, knowing that a majority will remain. – former acting dhs secretary chad wolf\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #3a: we are not expelling unaccompanied children.\n\nrating: false\n\nthe administration is expelling uacs who are from mexico every day. they have made a policy decision not to expel uacs from the northern triangle and the cartels and smugglers know this. the administration wants to have its cake and eat it, too, in wanting credit for supposedly treating unaccompanied minors more 'humanely' without any criticism for detention of increasing numbers of these minors. – former acting cbp commissioner mark morgan\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #3b: we are encountering six- and seven-year-old children, for example, arriving at our border without an adult.\n\nrating: misleading\n\nthe biden administration would have the american people believe most of the unaccompanied minors coming across the border are young children. this is false. the vast majority of uacs are between the ages of 15-17, with 75% over the age of 14. many of these young people are coming to the border hoping to gain illegal entry into the u.s. for economic reasons. minors should be treated humanely regardless of their age, but the administration's reliance on trying to pull the heart-strings of americans is just more evidence they are interested in manipulation, not facts.\n\nmayorkas' later accusation that the trump administration put more children at risk for trafficking is mind-blowing, as the biden administration's undoing of trump-era immigration policies has unleashed a historic flood of unaccompanied minors to the border, many of whom we know were trafficked or smuggled there. the biden administration has empowered the cartels and human traffickers after president trump severely cut their profit margins. – former acting cbp commissioner mark morgan\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #4: mexico does not have the capacity to receive families.\n\nrating: misleading\n\nthere are numerous misleading components to this answer. first, the surge in family units is a direct result of the biden administration's push for amnesty and undoing of effective trump-era immigration policies. mexico had been able to handle the return of family units under the trump administration's remain in mexico policy. second, mexico is not the only country that can receive these illegal aliens, as they can be deported back to their country of origin. third, the answer for mexico is to help them build capacity – which both the state department and other ngos can help enable. the answer is not release illegal aliens and let them into the u.s., knowing that 90% will not qualify for asylum. – former acting dhs secretary chad wolf\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #5: reasons for the border crisis.\n\nrating: misleading\n\ndhs blames the biden border crisis on violence in northern triangle countries, hurricanes, and the pandemic. to be clear, conditions are not so dramatically different in the northern triangle from years past to explain this historic surge. not once is responsibility taken for disastrous messaging and the removal of effective immigration policies without a clear plan in place. this is absurd. monthly apprehensions nearly doubled between summer of 2020 and february 2021, because the biden campaign and then the biden administration was sending a clear signal to the world – if you arrive soon, you will receive amnesty. –former acting dhs secretary chad wolf\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #6: the prior administration completely dismantled the asylum system.\n\nrating: false\n\nmayorkas' claims are simply false. u.s. citizenship and immigration services hired approximately 500 additional asylum officers to advance the trump administration's priority of reducing the asylum backlog. the administration also shifted resources to prioritize the asylum backlog and those seeking protection at our own border. the trump administration inherited a back-logged asylum system, and wisely chose to focus on reducing this backlog throughout his term. more individuals were granted asylum by dhs and doj during the four years of the trump administration than under the last four years of the obama administration. total asylum grants in 2019 alone – 46,508 – were the highest annual total since at least 1990. – lora ries, senior research fellow for homeland security & former acting dhs deputy chief of staff\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #7: the previous administration cut foreign aid funding to the northern triangle.\n\nrating: misleading\n\nunder the trump administration, we demanded results before handing over millions of dollars in foreign assistance funding. as a result, we signed over a dozen border security agreements and saw unprecedented cooperation and results from the northern triangle countries. these agreements helped slow the flow of illegal migrants through central america, especially massive caravans, to our southern border. the administration also made millions in funding available to these governments. – former acting dhs secretary chad wolf\n\n—————-\n\nclaim #8: there was no appropriate planning for the pandemic at all.\n\nrating: false\n\nthis statement is a slap in the face to the men and women at dhs, who worked tirelessly to put plans in place to deal with the challenge of a pandemic on top of keeping our immigration system running. we implemented extensive plans – to include vaccine distribution to frontline officers when the vaccine would be made available – to ensure our frontline workers would be protected. we worked with other federal agencies to ensure title 42 would be available to our immigration enforcement officials. we knew that putting illegal aliens in crowded border patrol facilities during covid was not the answer. unfortunately, the biden administration believes it is.\n\nwe provided the transition team with extensive briefings on the border and the tools we had in place to address illegal crossings. we warned them about the consequences of removing these policies. they heard it directly from cbp law enforcement officers. they heard that usbp stations did not have capacity, and they heard hhs did not have capacity. they knew it all and still rushed to dismantle the system for political reasons. – former acting dhs secretary chad wolf
the supreme court of the united states ruled tuesday that president trump's highly-contested 'travel ban' is within his constitutional rights to protect the citizens of the united states; adding the immigration restrictions did not amount to discrimination.\n\nthe 5-4 decision effectively ends multiple lower court decisions that blocked the revised guidelines just hours after the ban was to take effect.\n\nchief justice roberts said the restrictions fall within presidential power to regulate immigration and rejected critics claims of anti-muslim bias.\n\nthe 'travel ban' impacts travelers from iran, libya, somalia, syria, yemen, north korea, and venezuela.\n\nchallengers to the president's policy claim the restrictions were motivated by religious bias, while supporters claim the move was necessary to help protect the us from visitors without a proper vetting process.

'breakdown of civilization': la times slams city officials over homeless crisis, rat invasion, garbage piles\n\nposted by hannity staff - 6.10.19\n\na columnist with the los angeles times unloaded on city officials this week over the region's escalating homeless crisis, ongoing invasion of rodents, and sky-high garbage piles taking over the streets.\n\nlos angeles looks as if it's digging out from a hurricane, with hordes on the streets, tents everywhere and armies of rodents on the march, inciting fears of disease., steve lopez wrote in his column, which appeared online saturday night.\n\ni could give you a hundred breakdowns of what happened and what it all means, but it comes down to this: we're in troubled waters on a ship without a captain, and though there might be a few pretenders on the bridge, nobody trusts them, adds lopez.\n\nwe found out on tuesday that although the city and county spent $600 million last year to chip away at the number of homeless people, the total increased by 16% to nearly 60,000, adds the author.\n\ni naively invited readers last week to email me photos of trash heaps and encampments in their neighborhoods, and my inbox is about to explode, he wrote. i've got photos of half-clothed people passed out on pavement, sidewalks blocked by tents, bulky items, piles of poop and enough trash to fill the grand canyon.\n\nthe current rat invasion sweeping across los angeles extended into an unlikely place last week: city hall. experts are now blaming the infestation on homeless camps circling the public property.\n\nwhen faced with complaints earlier this year from city workers about rats infesting l.a. city hall, most city officials said little about whether the problem was connected to several homeless camps right outside, reports the los angeles times.\n\nbut a newly uncovered report from a pest control company hired by the city has raised fresh questions about whether officials wrongly downplayed that possibility during discussions at city council meetings, adds the newspaper.\n\naccording to the pest control company hired to clear city hall, workers found poor sanitary conditions including human waste, food, and needles throughout the property.\n\nthe homeless are using the grated areas above the pits as their bathroom and relieving themselves, wrote david costa, building construction and maintenance superintendent. this is also attracting the rats. custodial will need to do some hazmat cleaning of the grates and the pits. there are even hypodermic needles being tossed in the pits along with human waste and other garbage.\n\nthe invasion comes after two lapd officers were diagnosed with typhus and other serious diseases related to the city's rat population.\n\nread the full story at fox news.

iranian officials reportedly ordered a massive increase in the production of enriched uranium this week; openly defying the trump administration as tensions between tehran and washington rapidly escalate.\n\niran has quadrupled its production of enriched uranium amid tensions with the u.s. over tehran's unraveling nuclear accord, two semi-official news agencies reported monday, an announcement that came just after president donald trump and iran's foreign minister traded threats and taunts, reports the associated press.\n\nthis follows days of heightened tensions sparked by the trump administration's deployment of bombers and an aircraft carrier to the persian gulf over still-unspecified threats from iran. while trump's dueling approach of flattery and threats has become a hallmark of his foreign policy, the risks have only grown in dealing with iran, where mistrust between tehran and washington stretch back four decades, adds the author.\n\npresident trump issued a dire warning to iranian officials over the weekend; telling leaders in tehran any future acts of aggression against us interests would bring about the official end of their regime.\n\nif iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of iran. never threaten the united states again!, posted the commander-in-chief on social media sunday.\n\nif iran wants to fight, that will be the official end of iran. never threaten the united states again! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) may 19, 2019\n\nit's unclear exactly what prompted trump's posting, but news outlets reported explosions in iraq's capital and that a rocket launcher was discovered in eastern baghdad, an area that is home to iranian-backed shiite militias, reports the ny post.\n\nroads leading into the green zone were briefly closed and no casualties were reported, adds the article.\n\nthe president's comments come hours after secretary of state mike pompeo slammed the obama administration for refusing to get off the stage in ongoing talks with top iranian officials.\n\npompeo made the comments in a fox news radio interview with guy benson on thursday amid the increasing tensions between the u.s. and iran, and the calls to investigate kerry, the former secretary of state under president obama, over the alleged violations of the logan act for meeting with iranian officials, reports fox news.\n\nit is ahistorical and completely unhelpful when previous secretaries of state are continuing to engage in the tasks that they engaged in when they were the secretary of state … it's time to get off the stage for the previous administration, said pompeo.

the president is denying federal support for ventilators that are needed in hospitals treating coronavirus patients.\n\nin his message, the president recommended that states procure respirators and

vaccine\n\nwhat better way to increase the world's hatred of america, everyone's hatred of trump, and cause even more illegal aliens to crash into our country (seeking a vaccine) than to spread the fake news the american president is looking to monopolize any potential coronavirus vaccine?\n\nbut that is exactly what reuters, the guardian, business insider, and staffers at the new york times and msnbc did.\n\nthis lie doesn't even make sense.\n\nwhat good would it do america to corner the market on a vaccine? it costs us nothing to share the information so other countries can create their own vaccine. what good does it do the u.s. to sit around and watch everyone else die?\n\nnationwide curfew!\n\ngood ol' jim sciutto, one of the most infamous liars in the country, a former obama official hired by the serial liars at cnn to serial lie.\n\nnew: there are active discussions within the trump administration to encourage a possible 'curfew' across the nation in which non-essential businesses would have to close by a certain time each night, sciutto wrote on social media, citing cnn reporting.\n\nit's not true.\n\nand unless you're looking to sow panic, it also makes no

lied about the google website\n\ngoogle says it's not publishing a national-scale coronavirus site, cnn anti-trump activist jake tapper tweeted to his 2.3 million twitter followers last week.\n\nhe linked to a cnn story with the headline, google says it's not publishing a national-scale coronavirus site anytime soon. this was a story that smeared trump as a liar for announcing google will be building a national-scale coronavirus website.\n\nthe original and very fake cnn story can be found here.\n\nhere's the opener:\n\ngoogle will not be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon, contrary to claims made by president donald trump during a friday news conference.\n\ninstead, a health-focused subsidiary owned by google's parent company, alphabet, intends to launch a small-scale website next week to begin to triage california-based patients. the website will aim to serve a broader population only over time — not very quickly, as trump said.\n\nwhat we're building is a triage tool that will live on projectbaseline.com, and we plan to pilot it in california next week, said carolyn wang, a spokesperson for the alphabet subsidiary, verily.\n\nhere's the google search screencap which captured cnn's lie:\n\nbut now, if you click on that google link, the cnn story says the exact opposite of what the original story said. here's the new headline and opener:\n\ngoogle will partner with us government to develop a nationwide coronavirus website, company says\n\ngoogle now says it is working with the government on the creation of a national website containing information about coronavirus symptoms and testing information.\n\ngoogle is partnering with the us government in developing a national website that includes information about covid-19 symptoms, risk and testing information, the company said in a series of tweets saturday evening.\n\nthe company did not give a time frame of when such a website would be up and running.\n\non friday after the president said google was helping to develop a website and it would be available soon, the company declined to say it would be publishing a national-scale website for coronavirus testing anytime soon.\n\nnaturally, there is no editor's note informing readers the original story was a lie or has been retracted or updated, which is highly unethical.\n\ncnn spread a bald-faced lie to undermine the president, got caught, and did everything in its malevolent power to cover that lie up.\n\ntrump shut down the cdc's pandemic department!\n\ndo i even need to point out how virulent and widespread this talking point has been?\n\nsigh:\n\nno, the white house didn't 'dissolve' its pandemic response office. i was there.\n\nit has been alleged by multiple officials of the obama administration, including in the post, that the president and his then-national security adviser, john bolton, dissolved the office at the white house in charge of pandemic preparedness. because i led the very directorate assigned that mission, the counterproliferation and biodefense office, for a year and then handed it off to another official who still holds the post, i know the charge is specious.\n\n…\n\nit is true that the trump administration has seen fit to shrink the nsc staff. but the bloat that occurred under the previous administration clearly needed a correction. defense secretary robert gates, congressional oversight committees and members of the obama administration itself all agreed the nsc was too large and too operationally focused (a departure from its traditional role coordinating executive branch activity). as the post reported in 2015, from the clinton administration to the obama administration's second term, the nsc's staff had quadrupled in size, to nearly 400 people. that is why trump began streamlining the nsc staff in 2017.\n\nthe reduction of force in the nsc has continued since i departed the white house. but it has left the biodefense staff unaffected[.]\n\n…\n\nit is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented. if anything, the combined directorate was stronger because related expertise could be commingled.\n\nin other words, it wasn't dissolved, it was streamlined.\n\ntrump declared the coronavirus a hoax!\n\nthis desperate lie, launched by the far-left politico, was quickly debunked by fact-checkers, including the far-left washington post. that's how big of a lie it is — the washington post conceded it was a lie.\n\nnevertheless, cnn continues to spread this lie.\n\ncalling the wuhan virus the 'wuhan virus' is racist\n\nas has already been exhaustively pointed out, the naming of a virus or disease after a location — including a lily-white location like lyme, connecticut — is just how it's done and has been done forever.\n\nbut now it's racist, even though the very same media declaring it racist is the very same media that first called it the chinese virus or the wuhan virus, or some variation thereof.\n\nhere's a pretty comprehensive list that's been floating around. there are probably more examples, but this more than makes the point:\n\nnote: the photo in this article was on their cover for this issue.\n\nadditionally, the video below is nothing less than a devastating compilation of just how dishonest and unserious the media are:\n\nmrctv.org\n\n✔@mrctv\n\nliberal media pundits want you to think referring to the coronavirus as the wuhan or chinese virus is racist.\n\nhere's just a few of the times the liberal media did just that.\n\n18.8k\n\n3:34 pm – mar 12, 2020\n\ntwitter ads info and privacy\n\n12.7k people are talking about this\n\nto sum this up, the fake news media floods these words and terms into the american lexicon, and then sanctimoniously turns around and attacks those who repeat them as racist.\n\ntrump rejected who coronavirus test kits\n\neveryone from grandpa joe biden to cnn's dr. sanjay gupta to esquire to nbc news to, to, to… this is such a lie, the far-left politifact debunked it.\n\ntrump blocked testing because lower numbers are good for his reelection\n\nthis lie arrives courtesy of the welfare queens at npr and a newsweek staffer's hysterical amplification that has been retweeted almost a quarter-million times.\n\nand once again, i ask, how does this makes any sense?\n\nin the face of the facts, trump is doing back-flips to start testing. what's more, how does not testing benefit his re-election chances? it's not as if people who test positive won't eventually become symptomatic.\n\nthis is not just a lie (no other media outlet has confirmed it, which means even cnn couldn't find a lying source that has lied to them so many times before to lie about this one), it's by far the stupidest lie on this list.\n\nit's trump fault coronavirus testing was delayed\n\nnope:\n\ndr. anthony fauci, director of the centers for disease control and prevention's (cdc) national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said tuesday that the blame for the slow pace of testing for coronavirus in the u.s. does not lie with either president trump or the cdc.\n\nfauci told hugh hewitt on the hugh hewitt show that a technical glitch resulted in the delay in production of usable tests in the u.s., something fauci prescribed to random error.\n\n…\n\nthis has nothing to do with anybody's fault, certainly not the president's fault.\n\ntrump silenced dr. fauci\n\nthis lie spread like wildfire before fauci himself was given a chance to tell the truth.\n\nwe are plagued with a dishonest, unreliable, unserious, dangerous media, driven only by political calculation and naked greed.\n\nthe media are so evil and indecent, even a pandemic can't cure them.

i did universal health care when i was mayor– fully implemented, regardless of pre-existing condition, ability to pay, and regardless of your immigration status. san francisco is the only universal health care plan for all undocumented residents in america. very proud of that, newsom said. i'd like to see that extended to the rest of the state.\n\nnewsom was speaking on the left-leaning pod save america podcast when he weighed-in on his fellow democrats proposal for a medicare for all system; saying a universal healthcare scheme should apply to every person -regardless of immigration status- living in california.\n\ndemocratic candidate for governor of california gavin newsom raised eyebrows across the state this week; calling for a universal healthcare program to cover millions of illegal immigrants residing in the region.\n\ncalifornia schemin': gavin newsom 'pardons' immigrant felons to shield them from deportation\n\nposted by hannity staff - 5.15.19\n\ncalifornia's far-left governor gavin newsom continued his all-out-war with the trump administration over immigration this week; pardoning former felons and refugees the white house is seeking to deport.\n\nnewsom adopted a policy of his predecessor, former gov. jerry brown, to use his state constitutional authority to issue pardons to shield immigrants targeted by federal immigration officials, reports the los angeles times.\n\nthe pardons are an unmistakable rebuke to president trump, whose fiery anti-immigrant rhetoric and demands for a giant wall along the u.s.-mexico border have been central to the escalating political feud between newsom and the white house, adds the article.\n\ni'm constantly trying to understand the moment we're living in, the xenophobia, the nativism that marks the populism of this moment, newsom said. any of us who are students of history know that it's not without precedent. it's not novel. it's hardly new. it's very familiar.\n\none of the refugees -originally from cambodia- was arrested by federal immigration agents in march.\n\nthe man was convicted for solicitation to commit murder in 2001.\n\nthe pardons come just months after newsom vowed to sue the trump administration for declaring a national emergency along the us-mexico border.\n\npresident trump is manufacturing a crisis and declaring a made-up 'national emergency' in order to seize power and subvert the constitution, said newsom following the president's press conference. our message back to the white house is simple and clear: california will see you in court.\n\npresident trump got one thing right this morning about his declaration, when he said 'i didn't have to do this,' said california attorney general xavier becerra. in fact, he can't do this… this is a president showing his disdain for the rule of law and our u.s. constitution.\n\nread the full report at the los angeles times.

former vice president and democratic frontrunner joe biden released a statement friday afternoon regarding allegations of sexual abuse from a staffer that occurred nearly 30 years ago.\n\nread the full statement below:\n\napril was sexual assault awareness month. every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. that belief – that women should be heard – was the underpinning of a law i wrote over 25 years ago. to this day, i am most proud of the violence against women act. so, each april we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country – but how far we still have to go.\n\nwhen i wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. it was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. i didn't see it that way. to me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. and i knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture.\n\nso, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women – and we opened the eyes of the senate and the nation – and passed the law.\n\nin the years that followed, i fought to continually strengthen the law. so, when we took office and president obama asked me what i wanted, i told him i wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the office on violence against women at the department of justice and i wanted a senior white house advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. both of those things happened.\n\nas vice president, we started the it's on us campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence – and against the law.\n\nwe had to get men involved. they had to be part of the solution. that's why i made a point of telling young men this was their problem too – they couldn't turn a blind eye to what was happening around them – they had a responsibility to speak out. silence is complicity.\n\nin the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we're not done yet.\n\nit's on us, and it's on me as someone who wants to lead this country. i recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. so i want to address allegations by a former staffer that i engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.\n\nthey aren't true. this never happened.\n\nwhile the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. one is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. the second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny.\n\nresponsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways.\n\nbut this much bears emphasizing.\n\nshe has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. they – both men and a woman – have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. news organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one – not one – who corroborated her allegations in any way. indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way – as indeed i would not have.\n\nthere is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. the former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. but she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. the papers from my senate years that i donated to the university of delaware do not contain personnel files. it is the practice of senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills.\n\nthere is only one place a complaint of this kind could be – the national archives. the national archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the office of fair employment practices. i am requesting that the secretary of the senate ask the archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. if there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.\n\nas a presidential candidate, i'm accountable to the american people. we have lived long enough with a president who doesn't think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. that's not me. i believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. people need to hear the truth.\n\ni have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. i know how critical women's health issues and basic women's rights are. that has been a constant through my career, and as president, that work will continue. and i will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women's voices are heard.\n\nwe have a lot of work to do. from confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence.\n\nwe need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color.\n\nwe need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the united states and around the world a top priority.\n\ni started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the violence against women act. as president, i'm committed to finishing the job.

update***\n\na federal judge accused the biden administration of executive overreach this week after the white house attempted to halt all deportations of illegal immigrants for 100 days pending a nationwide review.\n\nu.s. district court judge drew b. tipton stated in a tuesday order that the directive from acting homeland security secretary david pekoske that halted removing those who already had final orders of removal against them appeared to run afoul of the administrative procedure act, which governs how federal agencies conduct rulemaking. the same law was used to block a number of trump administration actions as well, reports fox news.\n\nthe court finds that, by ordering a 100-day pause on all removals of aliens already subject to a final order of removal, it appears that the january 20 memorandum is clearly not in accordance with, or is in excess of, the authority accorded to the attorney general pursuant to 8 u.s.c. § 1231(a)(1)(a).\n\nfrom fox news:\n\na federal judge on tuesday temporarily blocked president biden's attempt to put a moratorium on deportations for 100 days.\n\nafter texas sued over the policy, the judge blocked biden, via a temporary restraining order, from moving forward for 14 days, as reported by reuters. texas' lawsuit claims that the administration would be violating an agreement it has with the department of homeland security – and would require at least 180 days' notice, as well as consultation, prior to implementing changes in immigration policy. it is unclear whether those terms are enforceable, but similar agreements were struck with several other states under the former administration. fox news exclusively reported over the weekend that an email sent last week to ice officers called for stopping all removals and to release them [undocumented immigrants] all, immediately. biden has pledged to move forward with a moratorium on deportations as his administration resets its approach toward u.s. immigration following the change in administration. noncitizens who have engaged in, or who are suspected to have engaged in, terrorism and espionage can still be deported. the moratorium – which took effect on friday – also does not apply to persons who were not physically present in the u.s. as of nov. 1, 2020. the biden administration was planning to announce further guidance on the issue by feb. 1.\n\nread the full report at fox news.

and well, was called the department for agitation and propaganda – or the ministry of propaganda whose sole function was shorthanded as agitprop. in those days there was only one official newspaper for the soviet population – pravda or truth.\n\nin today's american media world the truth comes from – and only from – the leftist state media.\n\nlong before cnn – when jeff zucker was barely out of diapers – then-vice president spiro agnew first discussed what he saw – way back there in 1969 – as a real problem with the media of the day. the vietnam war was raging, and president nixon had recently addressed the nation. nixon had been followed by a collection of liberal television commentators who proceeded to tell the american people what they thought nixon had really said.\n\nin a then-famous speech in, of all places, des moines, iowa, carried live by the television networks of the day (there were only three, and cable news did not yet exist) agnew said this:\n\nthe purpose of my remarks tonight is to focus your attention on this little group of men who not only enjoy a right of instant rebuttal to every presidential address, but more importantly, wield a free hand in selecting, presenting, and interpreting the great issues of our nation.\n\nfirst, let us define that power. at least forty-million americans each night, it is estimated, watch the network news. seven million of them view abc; the remainder being divided between nbc and cbs. according to harris polls and other studies, for millions of americans, the networks are the sole source of national and world news.\n\nin will rogers' observation, what you knew was what you read in the newspaper. today, for growing millions of americans, it is what they see and hear on their television sets.\n\nhow is this network news determined? a small group of men, numbering perhaps no more than a dozen anchormen, commentators, and executive producers, settle upon the 20 minutes or so of film and commentary that is to reach the public. this selection is made from the 90 to 180 minutes that may be available. their powers of choice are broad. they decide what forty to fifty-million americans will learn of the day's events in the nation and the world.\n\nwe cannot measure this power and influence by traditional democratic standards, for these men can create national issues overnight. they can make or break–by their coverage and commentary–a moratorium on the war. they can elevate men from local obscurity to national prominence within a week. they can reward some politicians with national exposure, and ignore others. for millions of americans, the network reporter who covers a continuing issue, like abm or civil rights, becomes, in effect, the presiding judge in a national trial by jury.\n\n…a raised eyebrow, an inflection of the voice, a caustic remark dropped in the middle of a broadcast can raise doubts in a million minds about the veracity of a public official, or the wisdom of a government policy. one federal communications commissioner considers the power of the networks to equal that of local, state, and federal governments combined. certainly, it represents a concentration of power over american public opinion unknown in history.\n\nwhat do americans know of the men who wield this power? of the men who produce and direct the network news, the nation knows practically nothing. of the commentators, most americans know little, other than that they reflect an urbane and assured presence, seemingly well informed on every important matter.\n\nwe do know that, to a man, these commentators and producers live and work in the geographical and intellectual confines of washington, d.c. or new york city–the latter of which james reston terms the most unrepresentative community in the entire united states. both communities bask in their own provincialism, their own parochialism. we can deduce that these men thus read the same newspapers, and draw their political and social views from the same sources. worse, they talk constantly to one another, thereby providing artificial reinforcement to their shared viewpoints.\n\nthe media problem agnew described all the way back in 1969 – a full fifty years ago, when donald trump was a mere 23 years old and barely a year out of grad school – has now metastasized, dominating the vast media complex of today.\n\nthe very prominence of new york's alexandria ocasio-cortez, the bartender-turned-congresswoman and media star, is the literal manifestation of agnew's point that the media can elevate men from local obscurity to national prominence within a week.\n\njeff zucker also said this of fox anchors:\n\nthey chose to work at fox and they don't get to hide behind the fact that they're excellent journalists or anchors. the fact is they work at a place that has done tremendous damage to this country.\n\nthat statement all by itself is a perfect illustration of how president zucker of the leftist state media sees his job – which is to arbitrarily declare his decidedly liberal opinion as fact. no wonder jim acosta feels free to do exactly the same thing.\n\nit is worth recalling that fox news was created in 1996 – during the clinton presidency, when cnn's lavish pro-clinton coverage had won it the derisive nickname the clinton news network. fox was followed three years later by rush limbaugh and the explosion of conservative talk radio.\n\nthe reason for the success of fox news and talk radio is exactly the failure of the leftist state media. millions of americans, doubtless unknowing in absorbing agnew's long-ago point, have had it up to their eyebrows going from one news outlet to another only to get some version of the exact same liberal spin.\n\nexample?\n\nhere is cnn on the clinton-trump race. the headline: https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/08/politics/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-cnn-poll-of-polls/index.html\n\ncnn poll of polls: clinton tops trump by 10\n\nthe story begins:\n\n(cnn)the post-convention polls are in, and they consistently show hillary clinton entering the next phase of the presidential election campaign with the upper hand over donald trump.\n\nhere is the new york times in its upshot column: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html\n\nhillary clinton has an 85% chance to win.\n\nthe upshot's elections model suggests that hillary clinton is favored to win the presidency, based on the latest state and national polls.\n\nhere is the huffington post: https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/polls-hillary-clinton-win_us_5821074ce4b0e80b02cc2a94\n\nhuffpost forecasts hillary clinton will win with 323 electoral votes\n\nthe huffpost presidential forecast model gives democrat hillary clinton a 98.2 percent chance of winning the presidency. republicandonald trump has essentially no path to an electoral college victory.\n\nand on and on went this business of one leftist state media outlet after another all saying exactly the same thing – hillary clinton was going to be the next president and donald trump had no way open to win.\n\nchange the subject from the 2016 election to, say, abortion, climate change, the economy or any of dozens of issues out there and time after time after time it makes no difference. you will get the left-wing agenda of the moment delivered by whatever outlet of the leftist state media you are choosing to watch or read.\n\nlet's cut to the chase. the real reason for jeff zucker's angst is that fox news and conservative talk radio, not to mention all manner of conservative internet sites have broken the stranglehold of information that once was the sole preserve of the leftist state media. and the only way the lsm chieftains see to get their monopoly back is to literally try and take out fox news and conservative commentators one by one, with media matters and others doing the dirty work.\n\nit is safe to say that that the leftist state media has in its midst excellent journalists or anchors. but when story after story after story is either wrong or obviously presented to further the left's favorite agenda item of the moment, (hillary certain to win! trump friend anthony scaramucci tied to russian investment fund! trump told cohen to lie to congress! trump and son tied to hacked documents from wikileaks! climate change report contradicts president! covington kids confronted indian elder and vietnam veteran!) then in fact the leftist state media, in jeff zucker's words, is for sure a place that has done tremendous damage to this country.\n\nin fact, it is safe to assume at this point that the members of the leftist state media simply can't help themselves. they are so far gone from journalism that they will say and do anything to push the left's agenda, damaging not only the country but themselves.\n\nwhich is exactly why jeff zucker's cnn, the washington post and doubtless soon-to-be-others in the leftist state media now find themselves being sued for hundreds of millions of dollars for libeling sixteen year old covington student nick sandmann. they simply could not stop themselves from doing it.\n\nand the irony? it is fox news and conservative media that has assumed the journalistic task as described by cnn founder ted turner the day cnn first went on the air in june of 1980.\n\nto provide information to people where it wasn't available before.\n\nexactly.\n\npick up jeffrey lord's swamp wars: donald trump and the new american populism. out on may

last week, former director of national intelligence john ratcliffe explained how he was concerned about the biden administration's policies on china because it was not supported by current intelligence.\n\nwe need joe biden and his administration to be successful in the realm of intelligence and national security or we all suffer, ratcliffe said. it's easy to get caught up in partisan politics and having said that, you know, i'm concerned.\n\nbecause the president himself, president biden, has taken some positions early on, with respect to, particularly with respect to both china and iran, that, frankly, setting all politics aside are not supported by our current intelligence and the threat landscape, ratcliffe continued. and things can't have changed that much for some of the policy decisions that he's advocating for, they just don't line up, with some of the positions that he's taking. so, i'm concerned about that.\n\nbiden recently came under fire after he seemingly defended the genocide of uighur muslims in china during a cnn town hall in milwaukee by stating that culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow.\n\nthe central principle of xi jinping is that there must be a united, tightly controlled china. and he uses his rationale for the things he does based on that. i point out to him, no american president can be sustained as a president if he doesn't reflect the values of the united states, biden said. and so the idea i'm not going to speak out against what he's doing in hong kong, what he's doing with the uighurs in western mountains of china, and taiwan, trying to end the 'one china' policy by making it forceful, i said — by the way, he said he gets it. culturally, there are different norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow.

president trump issued a series of pardons and grants of clemency tuesday afternoon for a handful of individuals; commuting the remaining prison sentence of democratic illinois governor rod blagojevich.\n\nhe'll be able to go back home with his family after serving eight years in jail, trump told reporters.\n\nread the white house's full press release below:\n\noffice of the press secretary\n\nfebruary 18, 2020\n\nstatement from the press secretary regarding executive grants of clemency\n\ntoday, president donald j. trump signed executive grants of clemency granting full pardons to the following individuals: edward debartolo, jr., michael milken, ariel friedler, bernard kerik, paul pogue, david safavian, and angela stanton. in addition, president trump signed executive grants of clemency granting commutations to rod blagojevich, tynice nichole hall, crystal munoz, and judith negron.\n\nedward debartolo, jr., is a successful businessman, real estate developer, and member of the pro football hall of fame. during the 23 years that he owned the san francisco 49ers, the team won an unprecedented 13 division titles and 5 super bowl championships. in 1998, he was convicted for failing to report a felony regarding payment demanded for a riverboat casino license, and he was sentenced to 2 years' probation. mr. debartolo did not allow his conviction to define his life. he remained a generous philanthropist and passionate supporter of numerous charitable causes, including charter schools like the brooks debartolo collegiate high school, and anti-gang violence initiatives. his exceptional compassion and warmth define his character to this day. mr. debartolo treated players and coaches as part of his family. many prominent individuals from the national football league have strongly advocated for this pardon, including joe montana, jim brown, jerry rice, steve young, ronnie lott, charles haley, derrick brooks, fred dean, robert kraft, jerry jones, and roger goodell. they have been joined in their support by other notable figures and organizations, including pastor darrell scott, kareem lanier, paul anka, and the urban revitalization coalition.\n\nmichael milken, one of america's greatest financiers, pioneered the use of high-yield bonds in corporate finance. his innovative work greatly expanded access to capital for emerging companies. by enabling smaller players to access the financing they needed to compete, mr. milken's efforts helped create entire industries, such as wireless communications and cable television, and transformed others, like home building. mr. milken's work also democratized corporate finance by providing women and minorities access to capital that would have been unavailable to them otherwise. in 1989, at the height of his finance career, mr. milken was charged in an indictment alleging that some of his innovative financing mechanisms were in fact criminal schemes. the charges filed against mr. milken were truly novel. in fact, one of the lead prosecutors later admitted that mr. milken had been charged with numerous technical offenses and regulatory violations that had never before been charged as crimes. though he initially vowed to fight the charges, mr. milken ultimately pled guilty in exchange for prosecutors dropping criminal charges against his younger brother. as a result, mr. milken served 2 years in prison in the early 1990s. since his release, mr. milken has dedicated his life to philanthropy, continuing charitable work that he began before his indictment. over the years, mr. milken—either personally or through foundations he created—has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in critical funding to medical research, education, and disadvantaged children. mr. milken's philanthropy has been particularly influential in the fight against prostate cancer and has been credited with saving many lives. this pardon has widespread and longstanding support, including from the following individuals: dr. miriam adelson, sheldon adelson, david bahnsen, tom barrack, maria bartiromo, ron burkle, secretary of transportation elaine chao, william ford, josh friedman, rudy guiliani, josh harris, rabbi marvin hier, ray irani, robert kraft, richard lefrak, randy levine, howard lorber, representative kevin mccarthy, larry mizel, arte moreno, rupert murdoch, sean parker, john paulson, nelson peltz, steven roth, david rubenstein, larry ruvo, marc stern, steven tananbaum, ted virtue, andrew von eschenbach, mark weinberger, and gary winnick.\n\nariel friedler was a successful entrepreneur, and built a successful technology company that employed more than 150 people and served more than 41 million students, staff, employers, and government constituents worldwide. in 2014, while serving as president and chief executive officer of the company, mr. friedler pled guilty to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization and served 2 months in prison. as a result of this incident, he was forced to sell the company that he had dedicated his life to building. during the investigation, his time in prison, and after his release, mr. friedler expressed deep remorse for his actions. since his release, mr. friedler has volunteered his time and expertise to promoting veterans issues and helping former prisoners reenter and rejoin society. in recognition of his rehabilitation, the state of florida restored his license to practice law. among those who support this grant of clemency are former new jersey governor chris christie and rabbi katz of the aleph institute.\n\nbernard kerik courageously led the new york police department's heroic response to the horrific attacks of september 11, 2001, as commissioner of the new york police department. he embodied the strength, courage, compassion, and spirit of the people of new york and this great nation as he served alongside first responders at the world trade center in the aftermath of the attack. in 2010, mr. kerik was sentenced to 4 years' imprisonment for tax fraud and for making false statements. since his conviction, he has focused on improving the lives of others, including as a passionate advocate for criminal justice and prisoner reentry reform. his 30 years of law enforcement service and tenure as commissioner of the new york city department of correction have given him a unique understanding and perspective on criminal justice and prisoner reentry reform, and he remains an invaluable contributor to these endeavors. mr. kerik is the recipient of countless awards for meritorious and heroic service, including a presidential commendation for heroism from president ronald reagan. among others, this pardon is supported by rudy giuliani, judge andrew napolitano, geraldo rivera, charlie daniels, chief paul cell, judge ray reddin, former chief of the passaic county sheriff's department john comparetto, representative peter king, christopher ruddy, chief and mrs. eddie gallagher, and sidney powell.\n\npaul pogue was the owner of a successful construction company and made significant charitable contributions every year. an audit by the internal revenue service discovered that mr. pogue had underpaid his taxes over a 3-year period by approximately 10 percent. immediately upon learning of the tax deficiency, mr. pogue paid restitution, interest, and penalties. to avoid the cost and burden of fighting the charges, which could have put at risk the jobs of the 150 people employed by his company, mr. pogue agreed to plead guilty and was sentenced to 3 years of probation. despite his conviction, mr. pogue never stopped his charitable work. for more than 30 years, he has provided significant humanitarian aid to countries around the world, including africa, india, and mexico, all while continuing to help his fellow americans in times of need. mr. pogue is the founder of two non-profit organizations. one constructs churches, clinics, schools, and orphanages in developing countries. the other provides disaster relief to communities in need. following hurricane harvey, his charity provided critical support to texans rebuilding their lives in the wake of the storm. in addition, mr. pogue's non-profit flies medical teams into disaster areas and flies people in need of medical treatment to doctors and hospitals. texas attorney general ken paxton, former pennsylvania senator rick santorum, mike buster, steve dulin, robert morris, jack graham, and james robison are among the many people who support this grant of clemency.\n\ndavid safavian has dedicated his life to criminal justice reform after serving nearly a year in prison. mr. safavian was convicted of making false statements and of obstructing an investigation into a trip he took while he was a senior government official. having served time in prison and completed the process of rejoining society with a felony conviction, mr. safavian is uniquely positioned to identify problems with the criminal justice system and work to fix them. mr. safavian is a fierce advocate for policy changes that improve public safety, protect families and victims, and reduce recidivism, including the first step act, which provides prisoners with a second chance through rehabilitative programs, fair sentencing, and smart confinement. the district of columbia restored his license to practice law, and his pardon is supported by several prominent individuals, including van jones, matt schlapp, mercedes schlapp, doug deason, mark holden, topeka sam, dan schneider, and jessica jackson.\n\nangela stanton overcame a difficult childhood to become a champion for redemption and rehabilitation for all who strive for a better life. in 2007, she served a 6-month home confinement sentence for her role in a stolen vehicle ring. today, ms. stanton is a national best-selling author, widely acclaimed television personality, and proponent of criminal justice reform. she works tirelessly to improve reentry outcomes for people returning to their communities upon release from prison, focusing on the critical role of families in the process. this pardon is supported by alveda king.\n\nin light of the decisions these individuals have made following their convictions to work to improve their communities and our nation, the president has determined that they are each deserving of full pardons.\n\nin addition, the president is commuting the sentences of four individuals who have paid their debts to society and have worked to improve their lives and the lives of others while incarcerated.\n\nrod blagojevich was the governor of illinois from 2003 until 2009, when he was charged with, among other things, offering an appointment to the united states senate in exchange for campaign contributions. he was convicted of those charges and sentenced to 14 years in prison. although the seventh circuit reversed some of his convictions related to the senate appointment, it did not alter his 14-year sentence. he has spent 8 years in prison. people from across the political spectrum and from varied backgrounds have expressed support for shortening mr. blagojevich's sentence, including senator dick durbin, reverend jesse jackson, sr., former representative bob barr, representatives bobby rush and danny davis, former attorney general eric holder, and bishop byron brazier. additionally, more than a hundred of mr. blagojevich's fellow inmates have written letters in support of reducing his sentence. during his confinement, mr. blagojevich has demonstrated exemplary character, devoting himself to improving the lives of his fellow prisoners. he tutors and teaches ged classes, mentors prisoners regarding personal and professional development, and speaks to them about their civic duties. notwithstanding his lengthy sentence, mr. blagojevich also counsels inmates to believe in the justice system and to use their time in prison for self-improvement. his message has been to keep faith, overcome fear, and never give up.\n\ntynice nichole hall is a 36-year-old mother who has served nearly 14 years of an 18-year sentence for allowing her apartment to be used to distribute drugs. while in prison, ms. hall has completed a number of job-training programs and apprenticeships, as well as coursework towards a college degree. in addition, ms. hall has taught prison educational programs to other inmates. she has accepted responsibility for her past behavior and has worked hard to rehabilitate herself. among those who support this grant of clemency are clemency for all non-violent drug offenders foundation, alice johnson, dan schneider, matt whitaker, adam brandon, kevin roberts, brett tolman, and john hostettler.\n\ncrystal munoz has spent the past 12 years in prison as a result of a conviction for having played a small role in a marijuana smuggling ring. during this time, she has mentored people working to better their lives, volunteered with a hospice program, and demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to rehabilitation. the texas a&m criminal defense clinic, the clemency for all non-violent drug offenders foundation, dan schneider, matt whitaker, adam brandon, kevin roberts, brett tolman, john hostettler, and alice johnson are among the many who support this grant of

with staff and inmates. this grant of clemency is supported by the clemency for all non-violent drug offenders foundation, dan schneider, matt whitaker, adam brandon, kevin roberts, brett tolman, john

outspoken senator and 2020 democratic presidential hopeful cory booker introduced new legislation this week that would create a federal panel to study the implementation of reparations for the descendants of enslaved americans prior to the civil war in the mid-19th century.\n\nthis bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white supremacy, and implicit racial bias in our country. it will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed, said booker.\n\nsince slavery in this country, we have had overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed african-americans economically for generations, booker added. many of our bedrock domestic policies that have ushered millions of americans into the middle class have systematically excluded blacks through practices like gi bill discrimination and redlining.\n\nthe issue of federal reparations has taken center stage in the 2020 democratic primary fight in recent weeks, with top candidates -including beto o'rourke and elizabeth warren- saying new legislation is required to study the potential payments.\n\nread the full report at fox news.
