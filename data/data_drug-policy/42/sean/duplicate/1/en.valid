BIDEN ON BOTCHED WAR STORY: 'Details Are Irrelevant'
Sanders is proposing that the federal government pay to wipe clean the student debt held by 45 million Americans – including all private and graduate school debt – as part of a package that also would make public universities, community colleges and trade schools tuition-free, adds the newspaper.
A spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., acknowledged Wednesday that the whistleblower alleging misconduct in the White House had reached out to Schiff's panel before filing a complaint — prompting President Trump, in an extraordinary afternoon press conference at the White House, to directly accuse Schiff of helping write the document, reports Fox News.
So, can you get rid of them? asked the undercover journalist.
The proposal calls for a 10-year transition from fossil fuels towards 100% renewable energy across the country, as well as sweeping social changes including new infrastructure, a revamped healthcare system, and a federal jobs program.
According to the survey, rich millennials include those younger than 35 with an income of $100,000 or higher. Wealthy young Americans are also fleeing Illinois, Virginia, and Massachusetts.
The controversy began at a campaign stop in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the democratic presidential hopeful captivated an audience of more than 400 attendees; sharing with them a personal story about his trip to the Kundera province in Afghanistan in 2008. The only problem? The story wasn't true.

Almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect. Based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened, reports the CTPost.

We should repeal this criminal prohibition to prevent future abuse. As president, I will immediately issue guidance to end criminal prosecutions for simple administrative immigration violations; end Operation Streamline, which subjects migrants to mass prosecutions; and refocus our limited resources on actual criminals and real threats to the United States, Warren concludes.

Well, the first thing we have got to do, whether or not I'm president, is to shut this president up right now said Sanders. Because he's undermining the doctors and the scientists who are trying to help the American people, it is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with un-factual information, which is confusing the general public.
A spokesman for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., acknowledged Wednesday that the whistleblower alleging misconduct in the White House had reached out to Schiff's panel before filing a complaint — prompting President Trump, in an extraordinary afternoon press conference at the White House, to directly accuse Schiff of helping write the document, reports Fox News.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, on Wednesday box office sales were only $300,000. By contrast, at the exact same time last year, ticket sales in North America made up roughly $10.7 million in revenue. That marks a historic 97 percent year-over-year decline. To demonstrate how quickly the coronavirus situation impacted the industry, the outlet reports that this time last week the box office total was $7.7 million. It is estimated that only 440 theaters in the United States remained open throughout the week, adds Fox.

'WORST MAYOR EVER': New Poll Shows President Trump MORE POPULAR than Bill De Blasio in NY
Entering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist Senator, it's also a criminal violation. This additional criminal provision is totally unnecessary for border security, and for a century, it was rarely enforced. But since the early 2000s, it has been used to build and sustain a massive immigration detention complex, writes Warren in an op-ed published by Medium.
Here's what it looks like when a CNN anchor calls Biden out for a racist statement:
I understand they have different views than we have, they are entitled to those views. But talking with senior leaders around the world and suggesting to them somehow that waiting out this administration is the best course of action for those countries is something that is unheard of, he added. It is fundamentally different than any previous administration has undertaken and they ought to leave the foreign policy to us.
The horrible polling numbers come as wealthy millennials flee NYC due to housing costs, massive taxes, and burdensome business regulations.
The NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that 26 percent of likely primary voters support Biden, while 19 percent support Warren. Trailing those two are Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders(I-Vt.), who are each backed by 13 percent, reports The Hill.

Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all, posted Biden on social media.
Nobody warned me about a potential conflict of interest. Nobody warned me about that, Biden told NPR in a story posted Monday.
You know John Kerry speaks to them a lot, and John Kerry tells them not to call. That's a violation of the Logan Act, and frankly he should be prosecuted on that, Trump told reporters at the White House.
Almost every detail in the story appears to be incorrect. Based on interviews with more than a dozen U.S. troops, their commanders and Biden campaign officials, it appears as though the former vice president has jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery, compassion and regret that never happened, reports the CTPost.

1. Don't cover it until Biden's staff has cleaned it up
As the Times noted, Biden's memoir makes no mention of any such arrest. As far as we can tell, Biden never mentioned this arrest before; neither can we locate any news accounts of him being arrested, adds the Post .
In 2016, over half of all federal criminal prosecutions were for immigration violations — more than prosecutions for terrorism, organized crime, hate crimes, or financial fraud. This obsessive focus ties up federal prosecutors and overwhelms federal courts. It's costly and unnecessary. And under Trump, it has become increasingly abusive, she adds.
And more importantly on this stuff, from a policy perspective, the Green New Deal is not an actual proposal. There is no actual plan in the Green New Deal. It just says, 'Everything is going to be wind and solar and we're going to get rid of airplanes and cows.' That's not a plan. That's not a serious proposal, he told Fox News.
